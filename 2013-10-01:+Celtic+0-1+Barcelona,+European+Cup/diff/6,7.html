Yes they had a lot of  possession but they rarely threatened. If we had been better in  possession we would have got a positive result from that but we gave it  away far too often.<br><br>Brown, gave the Ref a decision to make and  with the Barca players surrounding him, he caved in. Saying that, I  thought it was a red. He had a look at Neymar before flicking his leg  out. Yes Neymar made a meal of it but Brown shouldn&#39;t have done it.  Stupidity again.<br><br>We had two great chances to score (better than  any of their efforts up until then) and at this level you have take  them. We got sucked in and hit on the break. Izzy was ball watching and  once the ball was played to Sanchez, the rest of the defence ball  watched. Izzy is a liability and has been for a while.<br><br>Stokes was  anonymous most of the night, as was Commons. Mulgrew, tried his best  but his best isn&#39;t good enough for this level. Matthews was shocking in  possession at times. Add all that up and we were always going to  struggle.<br><br>Virgil and Ambrose solid in defence (lets forget about  the couple of times they were sloppy). Sammy, at times best player on  the park for us but his lack of footballing brain is astounding. To be  fair he wasn&#39;t supported often enough but still, keep the ball or be  clever with it! Big Forster kept us in in it with some world class  saves. Hopefully it will give him back his mojo. 						 						 						 					<br><br>(asgardtreasure of KDS)<br>Broonie really blew it.<br>There&#39;s no mitigation for that ....it was petulant, impulsive and it cost us.<br>We were in with a very strong shout of getting something. <br>I think the next 3 games are all winnable and if we manage 7 points that should be enough at least for 3rd spot.<br>9 could prove to be enough to put us in the running for 2nd spot.<br>So all is not lost. These next 3 games are vital. Barca rested a lot of players on match day 6 last season against benfica.<br>We&#39;ve shown in the last 2 games that we can compete at this level. <br>For us the battle must recommence with even greater earnest. We really will be fighting for our &#39;lives&#39; in the next 3 games. 						 						 						 					<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Forster         </li><li>    04  Ambrose         </li><li>    03  Izaguirre   Booked      </li><li>    05  van Dijk         </li><li>    23  Lustig   Booked   (Forrest - 70&#39;

Cesc Fabregas headed the winning goal in the 76th minute, shortly after substitute James Forrest had come close to giving Celtic the lead with a half volley that was well saved by Victor Valdes.<br><br>Virgil van Dijk then placed a free header just past the post from the subsequent corner. Handed some hope by the absence of the injured Lionel Messi, Celtic looked equipped to take something from the game until Brown&rsquo;s departure. As expected, Neymar was the central figure. However, Brown&rsquo;s rashness was a major factor in an engrossing Champions League Group H fixture at Parkhead.<br><br>Barcelona were given the usual rousing welcome by Celtic. Cheers turned to jeers for Neymar, who was involved in the 58th minute flashpoint that left Celtic with ten men. However, it was notable that the home fans provided the endlessly immaculate Iniesta with a loud and sporting ovation when he was substituted in the dying minutes, which the midfielder looked to appreciate. Brown, though, was the villain in some of the Celtic supporters&rsquo; eyes after an unnecessary red card that helped Barcelona make the breakthrough on what was beginning to look like it might be a frustrating night for the visitors.<br><br>Brown first nudged Neymar off the ball as the mercurial Brazilian took off again down the left wing. It was a fly kick at Neymar that sealed his fate however, with the referee having appeared ready to only book the skipper.<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon was as adventurous as he felt he could be, fielding Anthony Stokes in support of Georgios Samaras. As expected, however, it was the defence who took the strain last night, and Efe Ambrose and Van Dijk held strong in the face of the movable feast that is the Barcelona forward line.<br><br>Match winner Fabregas started in the false nine position but he could just as likely be seen collecting the ball from the centre halves in his own half. If so, Iniesta would step into the breach while Neymar lingered dangerously on the left wing, just waiting for the moment to wreak havoc. Indeed, right back Mikael Lustig was given an immediate taste of the wily player&rsquo;s talents when, in the opening minute, he was shown a clean pair of heels by the Brazilian.<br><br>The 21 year old could not make the impact on the game that he will have hoped in the first half, although he did come closest to opening the scoring in the first half when he flicked a Dani Alves just past the post.<br><br>Celtic ran into too many cul de sacs but were always vigilant in defence. Fraser Forster did well to tip a Xavi free kick round the post on the stroke of half time after Lustig had once again been tested by Neymar, who he had fouled at the cost of a booking. The Celtic support grew agitated as Lannoy persistently penalised the home team for innocuous challenges on several occasions in the first half &ndash; although he did elect not to book Ambrose when the defender made a reckless tackle on Sergio Busquets after he had lost the ball in a dangerous position in midfield.<br><br>But when he resisted the urge to make such sorties up the park, Ambrose formed an able defensive partnership with Van Dijk. It was in this centre half position that many felt would be Celtic&rsquo;s main area of weakness but this was a showing that made it harder to understand why Lennon had elected to play Van Dijk and Steven Mouyokolo in the play-off match in Khazakstan. Celtic survived to tell the tale after that tie and nights such as this one are the reward.<br><br>It seemed hard to credit that Barcelona could look as accomplished without the injured Messi, but they were every bit as comfortable in possession and were content to spread the ball around until an opening presented itself.<br><br>Manager Gerardo Martino cuts a less stylish figure than his predecessors Tito Vilanova and Pep Guardiola. However, he has helped maintain a slick passing style that Barcelona are renowned for. Surprisingly given the amount of talent on view, they were without a cutting edge until Fabregas&rsquo; 76th minute winner.<br><br>Celtic, for their part, lacked a Victor Wanyama-type figure in midfield. The Kenyan gave Celtic the lead in the 2-1 win last season and could impose himself in a way that Scott Brown and Charlie Mulgrew struggled to do last night. Their difficulties in this department grew even more pronounced after Brown&rsquo;s departure. However, Lennon was quick to make some alterations and sent on Beram Kayal and James Forrest for Lustig and Stokes. And minutes later Celtic almost took the lead when Forrest brought the ball down smartly before hitting a half volley towards the top corner. Valdes, however, was the equal to it and tipped the ball over. Van Dijk then headed Celtic&rsquo;s best chance past the post when Commons&rsquo; corner found him unmarked on the edge of the six yard box and with Valdes completely at sea.<br><br>Like Forrest, a substitute for Barcelona made a quick impact. Just a minute after replacing Pedro Rodriguez striker Alexis Sanchez crossed to the back post where Fabregas sent a header back across Forster and into the corner of the net for the 76th minute winner. The keeper excelled himself when preventing Barcelona going two ahead with three minutes remaining saving twice from Alexis in quick succession. Rather than another famous night at Parkhead, this was a case of what could have been.<br><br><br>Brave Bhoys beaten by Barca<br>Celticfc.net<br>By: Mark Henderson on 01 Oct, 2013 21:55<br><br>UEFA Champions League<br>Celtic Park, Glasgow<br>Tuesday, October 1, 2013<br><br>CELTIC&hellip;0<br><br>BARCELONA&hellip;1<br>Fabregas 76<br><br>CESC Fabregas&acute; late header gave Barcelona a slender 1-0 victory over battling 10-man Celtic in the UEFA Champions League group stage.<br><br>The Spanish internationalist headed home from substitute Alexis Sanchez&acute; cross 14 minutes from time to give the visitors the full spoils in Paradise and keep them in charge of Group H.<br><br>The Hoops competed gamely with their illustrious opponents but Scott Brown&acute;s sending off just before the hour mark proved too much of a burden to bear.<br><br>And they will now have to do without the skipper for the visit of Ajax later this month as they bid to pick up their first points in the competition.<br><br>Neil Lennon had opted to keep faith with the same starting XI that turned in such an impressive display against AC Milan in the opening group match.<br><br>However, there was a tactical switch as Georgios Samaras operated through the middle and Anthony Stokes performed a supporting striker role, while Kris Commons took up a wide-left berth.<br><br>Another incredible atmosphere greeted the players before kick-off as supporters offered another stirring rendition of &acute;&acute;You&acute;ll Never Walk Alone&acute; before holding aloft cards as part of a stunning stadium-wide display. The scene was set.<br><br>Amid a deafening din, the match got underway and the visitors quickly applied some early pressure, forcing several corners, while Virgil Van Dijk had to be alert to deny the advancing Andres Iniesta.<br><br>But backed by a boisterous crowd the Bhoys soon responded at the other end as Anthony Stokes played Georgios Samaras in at the end of a slick attacking move, but the Greek internationalist was denied by Victor Valdes from an acute angle.<br><br>The match soon settled into a predictable pattern with Gerardo Martino&acute;s outfit dominating possession and Celtic looking to frustrate and strike on the break.<br><br>But for all of Barcelona&acute;s dominance of the ball, clear chances were proving elusive against the Hoops&acute; well-organised and disciplined defence. Restricted to shots from distance, Neymar and Iniesta were unable to find the target and Adriano fired into the side-netting.<br><br>However, as half-time approached, they did begin to cause a few anxious moments as Neymar came close with a flick from Pedro&acute;s low cross before Xavi finally forced Fraser Forster into action with a curling free-kick.<br><br>The Barca midfielder had the first meaningful effort of the second half from the edge of the area but Van Dijk was once again well-positioned to make the block.<br><br>Celtic were continuing to hold their own against their star-studded opponents but their task became even more daunting when they were reduced to 10 men just before the hour mark when Scott Brown was given his marching orders after a clash with Neymar. It looked a harsh decision.<br><br>Despite their advantage in numbers, Barcelona were still being kept at bay by a dogged and determined Hoops side. Marc Bartra&acute;s long-range drive capped off a spell of heavy pressure but Forster was equal to the task.<br><br>And, remarkably, helped by some inspiring backing from the home support, the ten men fashioned two excellent chances in quick succession.<br><br>First, Charlie Mulgrew&acute;s long throw-in fell invitingly for substitute James Forrest, whose rasping drive was turned over by Valdes, and from the resulting corner, Mulgrew headed inches wide at the far post.<br><br>Those misses proved costly as Barcelona made the breakthrough in their next attack. Alexis Sanchez who had just entered the fray from the bench, reached the byline and his cross was headed beyond Forster by Fabregas.<br><br>It was cruel blow and as the clock ticked down, Celtic were forced to commit more men forward in search of an equaliser leaving them increasingly vulnerable at the back.<br><br>Forster produced heroics to get a hand to Neymar&acute;s low shot and then block the rebound from Sanchez. And he made another magnificent save in added time from Neymar when the Brazilian was clean through on goal.<br><br>Despite some late pressure, there would be no way back for the Hoops and no repeat

hard-fought 1-0 UEFA Champions League win over 10-man Celtic at Celtic Park.<br><br>Celtic captain Scott Brown was sent off just before the hour mark for kicking out at Neymar and Barcelona make their numerical advantage count with Fabregas scoring the only goal of the game 14 minutes from time.<br><br>The defeat is Celtic&#39;s second in Group H and leaves them facing an uphill battle to reach the knockout stages, while Barcelona made it two wins out of two to top the group.<br><br>Barcelona, as expected, dominated possession from the first whistle, but it was Celtic who created the first chance of the game after five minutes.<br><br>Kris Commons found Anthony Stokes in space and he slipped in Georgios Samaras inside the box with a clever pass, but Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes was quickly off his line to keep out his effort from a tight angle.<br><br>Barcelona continued to push and probe in search of an opening, but they were struggling to make any inroads into a well-organised Celtic rearguard.<br><br>Adriano had a sight of goal on 26 minutes when Neymar found him down the left, but under pressure from Efe Ambrose he could only drill his shot into the side-netting.<br><br>Barcelona created their best opening of the first half four minutes before the break when Alves flashed over a cross from the right and Neymar got ahead of his marker Virgil van Dijk to flick his shot from 12 yards just wide of the target.<br><br>Celtic suffered a major blow just before the hour mark when Brown was shown a straight red card after appearing to kick out at Neymar after bringing down the Brazilian in full flow.<br><br>Despite being down to 10 men Celtic went close to breaking the deadlock on 74 minutes when the ball dropped to substitute James Forrest inside the box and he fired in a fierce half-volley which Valdes brilliantly tipped over the crossbar.<br><br>From the resulting corner Celtic missed the best chance of the game as Valdes came out for the cross and got nowhere near it, but Charlie Mulgrew could only head his effort wide of the target with the goal at his mercy.<br><br>Celtic were made to pay for that miss as just two minutes later Barcelona grabbed the lead with substitute Alexis Sanchez crossing for Fabregas to head home from six yards.<br><br>Forster prevented Barcelona from adding a second goal with a superb double save two minutes from time to deny Neymar and then Alexis as Barcelona looked to finish off the game.<br><br>Neymar had the final chance of the game in stoppage time when Alexis sent him clear on goal only for Forster to produce another great save to keep out the Brazilian, but it did not matter as Barcelona took all three points.  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows"

after Brown had been shown a straight red card for kicking out at Barcelona forward Neymar.<br><br>Brown flailed a foot that caught the Brazilian on the arm and, despite Celtic protestations, he was dismissed.<br><br>Barca&#39;s victory may well have come regardless of Brown&#39;s dismissal, with the Spanish champions enjoying 82% of possession, and the hosts forced to survive a sustained period

protested at the decision to send off Brown on 59 minutes<br><br>And it comes a year on from their famous victory against the same opponents last season, when Tony Watt hit a late winner for Neil Lennon&#39;s men.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s sense of injustice over the red card would scarcely have been diminished by Neymar&#39;s part in the winning goal.<br><br>He picked the ball up in space, deep in home territory, spun and fed Alexis, whose perfect cross was headed back across Fraser Forster by Fabregas and into the net.<br><br>Few of the 60,000 supporters inside Celtic Park would have begrudged the visitors the lead had it come before the game took that ugly turn but, as it was, it was greeted with rancour.<br><br>What was all the more galling for the home fans was that it came just minutes after Victor Valdes had pulled off the save of the match to keep out a fierce effort from substitute James Forrest, with Charlie Mulgrew heading narrowly wide from the resulting corner.<br>Scott Brown is sent off<br><br>Neymar tumbled to the ground under a challenge from the Celtic skipper<br><br>It had taken until the stroke of half-time for Barcelona - missing the talismanic Lionel Messi - to force a save from Forster.<br><br>The goalkeeper on that occasion pushed a Xavi free-kick away for a corner, but until then the protection offered to him by his team-mates had been absolute.<br><br>In the face of relentless Barca probing, the back four and the four in front of them stood firm as the visitors passed their way to the edge of the Celtic penalty area, only to find it largely impenetrable.<br><br>That led them to try their luck from further out, but first Neymar dragged a shot wide after dancing his way in from the left wing and then the magical Andres Iniesta sold Mulgrew an outrageous dummy but blasted off target.<br><br>Forster would have struggled to reach Neymar&#39;s deft redirecting of a Dani Alves cross, but happily for the keeper it spun outside the post as he sprawled to his left.<br><br>Then came the game&#39;s turning point, when Brown was shown a straight red card, and Barcelona took full advantage.<br><br>The scoreline might have been even greater but for Forster, who brilliantly denied Neymar twice in the closing minutes.<br><br>And while Celtic can be proud of a gallant performance, there was to be no repeat of last year&#39;s astounding 2-1 home win as they suffered their second defeat in as many Champions League matches this season.<br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 0, Barcelona 1.<br>90:00
