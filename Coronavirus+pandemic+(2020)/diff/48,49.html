As the  Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp put it once <i>&quot;Football is the most important of the least important things</i>&quot;  (you can agree with that or not to whatever degree you wish). We love  football and can argue its relative ranking in our lives, for many  reading this article on this site, it rates highly, but some events mean  that football is forced down the pecking order, and one of those events  was with the tragic COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. </div><div><br>COVID-19  is an illness that can affect the lungs and airways, and is caused by a  virus called coronavirus. The symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are a  cough, a high temperature and shortness of breath, and for the more  vulnerable in society it can lead to a premature death. </div><div><br>The  disease originated in China and spread fast across the entire world,  leading to border closures, people forced to work from home, isolation  of people and so on. Sadly many have died from the disease, RIP. A  fuller discussion &amp; analysis on coronavirus is left to a more  appropriate forum. </div><div><br>Our condolences to all those who have lost family, friends and colleagues RIP.<br><br><b>Scottish football</b><br>Scotland  was not immune, and cases began to come to light around February/March  2020. The UK government was sadly slow and not as proactive as others  across the globe but fell into line and enacted stringent measures.</div><br><div>Sporting,  political &amp; social events were cancelled en mass across the globe,  and inevitably this would hit Scottish football too. Even the Tokyo  Olympics were postponed.</div><div><br>In March 2020, just a  few days before the key third Celtic v Sevco league match of the season,  all Scottish football matches were postponed. Admittedly at first the  SFA were a mess and did not timely delay the matches but were going  ahead, but as all else across Europe &amp; even in the UK were  postponing or cancelling their fixtures, the SFA followed suit. The  general Scottish public agreed and there was pressure from football fans  to cancel the games. The first Scottish victim of the pandemic occurred  just a day or two after the football match suspension. </div><div><br>Celtic  at this point were comfortably 13pts ahead in the league (albeit Sevco  had a game in hand) with just nine league games left to play. Similarly  in England, Liverpool also had a near impassable lead in their league  title challenge (their first league title for 30 years). Some groups  were trying to have the leagues annulled (mostly for their own ends,  e.g. Sevco). Celtic were going for a history equalling nine-in-a-row  league titles, and an unprecedented fourth treble in a row. </div><div><br>Concerns were growing for the survival of many smaller clubs as lost gate receipts were vital for their existence, and after the usual melodrama with the voting, the leagues were ended early with only Sevco &amp; relegation threatened Hearts in the top tier against. It was the right thing to do, so that prize money could be distributed to help and so planning for next season could begin which could start afresh.</div><div></div><div><br>One Sevco fan called up Clyde one phone in so incensed at the Scottish League&#39;s majority decision to end league&#39;s early (Belgian league was first) that he was stated he was to boycott all Hampden events (which would include a Beyonce concert). We all laughed.<br><br>Sevco tried to make themselves relevant questioning processes at the SFA, and called for resignations, but they were all in the wrong, and resoundingly defeated in democratic votes across the structures. </div><div><br>As was practical, the SPFL ended the league campaign and so Celtic were crowned champions &amp; Hearts relegated. Celebrations were sadly limited to online social media, with Celtic achieving the record nine league titles in a row. An incredible achievement.<br><br>[...]</div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Timeline notes<br></h3></div><ul><li>13 Mar 2020 - Football suspended in Scotland </li><li>March 2020 - Ex-Celt Artur Boruc isolated due to contact with team mate who has symptoms.</li><li>March 2020 - Lockdown in UK enacted</li><li>March  2020 - Celtic FC: &quot;We have already established a Football for Good Fund  which is in the  process of distributing &pound;175,000 to vulnerable people  affected by this  crisis and will continue to do all we can to offer as  much support as  possible.&quot;</li><li>28 Mar 2020 - Ex-Celt Andy Ritchie reveals he has the virus and his body is &#39;crippled&#39;. We wished him the best. (post-note: he came thru it, thankfully, and some reports on side saying tabloids over-egged it, which is quite despicable).<br></li><li>01  Apr 2020 - Celtic have, in a statement, ensured that the members of  staff on  furlough will still receive their full salary with the club  making up  the difference from the scheme.</li><li><div class="rtearea">06  Apr 2020 - Following the serious misrepresentation of Celtic FC, The  Herald newspaper made the following apology to the Club.&ldquo;On our front  page promotion for a column on Saturday, we stated  &#39;Celtic cutting  non-playing staff&rsquo;s money shows how far football has  lost its soul&#39;.  &quot;We are happy to clarify that Celtic have not cut any non-playing   staff&rsquo;s money. All staff on the Government&rsquo;s job retention scheme are   having their salaries paid in full by Celtic. We apologise to Celtic   for our error.&quot;</div></li><li>06 Apr 2020 - Celtic make clear publicly  they want the season&#39;s remaining league matches to finish, pulling the  rug from under the feet of those claiming Celtic are trying to close the  season early as Celtic are on top at present. The Belgians have though  already ended their league early and made the leading side the  champions. <br></li><li>April 2020 - Green Brigade group have delivered  hundreds of NHS hampers to those in need. Much respect to them and all  others who are also doing similar to help those in need in our  community.</li><li>April 2020 - UK PM ends up in intensive care due to COVID-19.</li><li>April 2020 - Celtic League/Pro-14 rugby annul their competitions, nobody cares. Later Glasgow Rugby coach states the title should have been awarded correctly to Leinster, but Edinburgh disagree. Shows that not all was rosy there either.<br></li><li>07  Apr 2020 - Sevco first-team squad and the club&rsquo;s executive directors  have volunteered to  take a reported 50 per cent salary deferral for the  next three months as  the club bids to come to terms with the lack of  income due to the  shutdown of football caused by the coronavirus  pandemic.</li><li>09 Apr 2020 - Celtic announce the club&#39;s Chief Executive, Manager, non-executive directors, executive  team, and backroom staff, including Academy and Football Operation  executives, have volunteered to take a significant reduction in  salaries and make deferrals of a significant proportion of their  earnings. <br></li><li>10 Apr 2020 - Ex-Celt Kenny Dalglish diagnosed with COVID-19 (but thankfully came thru it)<br></li><li>10 Apr 2020 - Scottish league teams meet to push for early termination of the season, one Championship club holding all up. Sevco &amp; Hearts in top tier are against it with some laughable public statements from Sevco.</li><li>15 Apr 2020 - The 2019-20 Scottish Football League season is over after Dundee voted yes to an SPFL resolution after a lot of dramas and comical Sevco statements. It means Dundee United are declared Championship winners, with Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers champions of Leagues One and Two respectively. Celtic expected to be awarded league as can&#39;t see matches going ahead even behind closed doors. Scottish Cup likely cancelled now. <br></li><li>16 Apr 2020 - Sevco declared they will consider &ldquo;all legal options&rdquo; open to them in  order to challenge the SPFL&rsquo;s controversial resolution vote and to  ensure the 2019-20 Premiership season is played to a finish on the  pitch. The Ibrox club have condemned the passing of the SPFL board&rsquo;s  proposal to end the campaign, describing it as &ldquo;deeply flawed&rdquo;. Sour grapes an attempt more to make themselves just look relevant.</li><li>19 Apr 2020 - Hibs chief Leeann Dempster has warned a meteor is heading towards  Scottish football. It follows the First Minister Nicola Sturgeon  suggesting it will be difficult for football to even return behind  closed doors anytime soon. </li><li>20 Apr 2020 - SPFL plan to crown Celtic champions is premature warns Uefa chief. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin has insisted it is still too soon for top flight leagues to call time on their 2019-20 seasons, casting significant doubt on the SPFL&rsquo;s plan to crown Celtic champions and relegate Hearts this month.</li><li>22 Apr 2020 - Uefa has opened the door to  domestic league and cup competitions being cancelled &quot;in special cases&quot;  due to the coronavirus pandemic. It  paved the way in Scotland for Celtic to be declared champions and for  Hearts to be relegated, pending potential reconstruction of the leagues  in time for next season.</li><li><span class="diffAdd">1 May 2020 - Sevco fans claim they found a smoking gun to show that Celtic former board member Dominic Keane had paid &pound;50,000 in the days after the SPFL vote. Problem is that the gormless fools were taken in as a Celtic fan had made up a fake invoice showing that Dundee had been paid &pound;50,000 in the days after the SPFL vote. Gormless-Gate as some called it, and all outwith of Ibrox laughed at them. They&#39;d made a huge deal of this (see article below).</span><br></li><li>May 2020 - Pandemonium in Scottish football, worst melodramas in sport. Sevco release a dossier of supposed questioning of decisions, only for it to be a damp squid.

This is of paramount importance as  the country enters the  &lsquo;delay&rsquo; phase of the coronavirus pandemic.<br><br>&ldquo;It  is also why the  Scottish FA is compelled to ensure that the suspension  is cascaded  through the non-professional and grassroots games until  further  notice.&rdquo;<br><br>League chief Neil Doncaster said: &ldquo;As everyone knows, this is a fast-moving and unprecedented situation for the entire country.<br><br>&ldquo;We   have been in intensive and detailed discussions since last night and   have also been taking on board the experience of our counterparts in   England and across Europe. As a result, the board of the SPFL has agreed   this morning that all league fixtures this weekend and next midweek   will be postponed until further notice.<br><br>&ldquo;The health and safety of   fans, players and officials is absolutely paramount. We have not yet   had any confirmed cases of Coronavirus amongst players in Scotland, but,   given the nature of this outbreak, it seems only a matter of time.<br><br>&ldquo;We   realise that many people will be bitterly disappointed, and we would   obviously prefer to be in a position where we can continue as normal,   but that&rsquo;s neither realistic nor possible.&rdquo;<br><br>UEFA has already   postponed all of next week&rsquo;s Europa League and Champions League   fixtures, including Rangers&rsquo; trip to Germany to face Bayer Leverkusen,   while PFA Scotland has expressed concern at the prospect of games being   played behind closed doors, insisting the welfare of players should  come  first.<br><br><div><img align="bottom" alt="Coronavirus pandemic (2020) - The Celtic Wiki" height="446" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/fb8afaa84b7276099b873722f9f1a0f7/GW446H446" title="Coronavirus pandemic (2020) - The Celtic Wiki" width="446"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><div><h3>  Celtic Football Club statement</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/17911<br>By: Newsroom Staff on 10 Apr, 2020 14:39<br><br>CELTIC Football Club today confirmed that a package of measures has been agreed with staff and players which will help the club to come through the current coronavirus crisis on a stable basis while ensuring that the rights and interests of all colleagues are safeguarded.<br><br>For the period April-June, the club&#39;s Chief Executive, Manager, non-executive directors, executive team, and backroom staff, including Academy and Football Operation executives, have volunteered to take a significant reduction in salaries and make deferrals of a significant proportion of their earnings.<br><br>Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: &ldquo;I would like to pay tribute to Neil and the players for their desire to play their part and the outcomes achieved. I am also grateful to my own executive team for the commitment they have devoted to this outcome in very difficult working circumstances and also their own willingness to play a part in the measures adopted.<br><br>&quot;I am extremely appreciative of the willingness of everyone concerned, to recognise the practical difficulties which this awful crisis has created. Celtic are in a strong financial position but we are not immune to this unique set of circumstances.<br><br>&quot;Our club is built on a great collective spirit and we are acutely aware of our responsibilities to colleagues, supporters and society as a whole. The fact that we can announce this package of measures in a spirit of harmony is testimony to the unity which exists within the club and will carry us into the future.<br><br>&ldquo;We will negotiate and overcome these unprecedented times of challenge with continued teamwork and support for each other and I would like to thank our fans for the continued support which they give to the Club. Our togetherness is our strength.<br><br>&ldquo;I also want to take this opportunity to thank all those people, across so many areas of life, who are so bravely doing all they can to keep us safe and well. Everyone at Celtic applauds this monumental effort.&rdquo; <br><br>Neil Lennon said: &quot;This club is all about teamwork and solidarity, on and off the park. We are well aware of the economic realities and are very willing to play our part in recognising them. We will come through this in unity and then look forward to the challenges ahead.<br><br>&quot;We also know that many within society, including our own support, are facing distress and, in some cases, tragedy. Everyone at Celtic Football Club, including the players and my own backroom team, expresses our appreciation of the work being done by NHS staff, carers and all who are providing vital public services at this time.&quot;<br><br>The package of measures will apply from April to June, to be reviewed thereafter.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  </h3><h3>Celtic Football Club statement</h3><br>By: Newsroom Staff on 12 May, 2020 15:41<br>[Privacy Badger has replaced this Facebook Share button.] Tweet<br><br>CELTIC Football Club welcomes the decisive vote by SPFL clubs to reject a lawyer-led inquiry into the processes relating to the resolution approved last month with support from the vast majority of clubs. <br><br>We are satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing by the board or executive and do not consider that such an inquiry is necessary.<br><br>We now appeal to all clubs to look to the future in the knowledge that the threats which exist to the fabric of Scottish football are grave and unprecedented. All of our energies should be applied to planning for the return of the game in season 2020-21 and to the financial survival of all our clubs.<br><br>This current crisis is the fault of no individual or organisation and it would be irrational to suggest otherwise. It is the duty of everyone committed to the future of our game to make the best of this awful situation, and not the worst. <br><br>We greatly regret the denigration of named individuals who have, on every occasion, acted upon decisions which were made by the board of the SPFL, representing all 42 clubs. The board and executive of the SPFL have operated under circumstances of unique difficulty in dealing with challenges of an unprecedented nature.<br><br>Although Celtic are not directly involved in issues of promotion and relegation, we have great sympathy for clubs which will end up in a lower division. While we have been supportive of temporary reconstruction, Celtic also understands the position of clubs who do not support league reconstruction at this time.<br><br>We recognise the hugely damaging effects that measures to counter the pandemic are inflicting on football clubs of all sizes across Scotland, Europe and beyond. It is the duty of everyone with the interests of football at heart to work for the greater good of securing the future of our sport.<br><br>In that spirit, Celtic will play our part in ensuring the earliest possible safe return to something approaching normality. Our highest priority is the safety of our players and supporters and we are acutely aware that Scottish football&rsquo;s current difficulties represent only a tiny part of the challenges faced by society as a whole.  <div><div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>SPFL Clubs Reject Call For Inquiry</h3></div><div>Tuesday 12th May 2020</div><div>Resolution Rejected in All Three Voting Sections, Less Than One Third of All Clubs Vote in Favour<br>SPFL clubs have voted to reject a resolution by Hearts, Rangers and Stranraer to hold an independent inquiry into last month&rsquo;s directors written resolution.<br>The resolution today required at least 75% of votes in each of the three voting sections (Ladbrokes Premiership / Championship / League 1 &amp; 2) to succeed. However, less than one third of all clubs voted in favour.<br>All 42 clubs cast their ballots, with 13 in favour, 27 against and two abstentions.<br>In the Ladbrokes Premiership, where nine clubs would have been required to vote in favour, a total of four clubs (33%) supported the resolution, with eight clubs (67%) opposing it.<br>In the Ladbrokes Championship, where eight clubs would have been required to vote in favour, a total of one club (10%) supported the resolution, with nine clubs (90%) opposing it.<br>In Ladbrokes Leagues One and Two, where 15 clubs would have been required to vote in favour, a total of eight clubs (40%) supported the resolution, with ten clubs (50%) opposing it and two clubs (10%) abstaining.<br>Speaking shortly after today&rsquo;s EGM, which was held via video conference with clubs casting their ballots electronically, SPFL chairman Murdoch MacLennan urged all clubs to respect the democratic process and unite behind efforts to restart football as soon as could be done safely.<br>He said: &ldquo;The last few weeks have been bruising ones for many people in our game. Far too many words have been spoken and written which have sown anger and division amongst clubs. That is a matter of the deepest regret to very many people in our game, myself included.<br>&ldquo;I know those who proposed this resolution will be disappointed, but I trust that everyone involved, on both sides of this argument, will now respect the clear, democratic and decisive result we have seen today and allow our game to move forward together. The overwhelming majority of clubs voted to oppose this resolution and it&rsquo;s now incumbent on all clubs to put their differences aside, otherwise we will all suffer together.<br>&ldquo;I have taken careful note of the concerns expressed by the minority of clubs which voted in favour and when we are back to playing football in a safe environment, I will bring clubs together to discuss the lessons learned.<br>&ldquo;Every single one of us understands that the Covid-19 pandemic has brought huge challenges for our game, which we must overcome soon if we are to save all 42 clubs and restart the sport we all love.<br>&ldquo;That is a daunting prospect in its own right &ndash; one of the gravest our sport has faced and it&rsquo;s no exaggeration to say that it threatens the very existence of many of the SPFL&rsquo;s clubs if we get it wrong.<br>&ldquo;If Scottish football is to survive this, we simply must unite and use the enormous talents, resources and creativity at our collective disposal to rescue our game.<br>&ldquo;Time is short. In reality, we must do everything humanly possible to get games back up and running by the end of July.<br>&ldquo;We simply cannot afford the distraction of further infighting or legal challenges.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure we can all agree that the quicker we get back to playing football, the better.&rdquo;<br>Back to news <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h3><span class="diffAdd">THE CELTIC FAN&rsquo;S EXECUTION OF GORMLESS-GATE SHOWS SEVCO SOCIAL MEDIA AT ITS WORST.</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">https://thecelticblog.com/2020/05/blogs/the-celtic-fans-execution-of-gormless-gate-shows-sevco-social-media-at-its-worst/</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Date: 1st May 2020 at 1:47pm</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Written by: James Forrest </span><br><span class="diffAdd">I took my time considering what to call Sevco social media&rsquo;s latest embarrassment.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I had a lot of possible names for it, but Gormless-gate works for me.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">It sums them up perfectly.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">It was so easy to execute too; the guy responsible knew he only had to scatter enough breadcrumbs and the febrile minds on their forums would take care of the rest.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">In case you&rsquo;ve missed this, a Celtic fan made up a fake invoice showing that Dundee had been paid &pound;50,000 in the days after the SPFL vote.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">He knew that it he got it out there that the geniuses over in La La Land would do their own &ldquo;digging&rdquo; and find the &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; they wanted.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">The money was apparently coming from a company owned by Dominic Keane.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">In every way, this was the perfect trick to pull on this lot. Keane has no official connection to Celtic these days but was once on the board.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">But he&rsquo;s also got history putting his money into other Scottish clubs, so it was plausible that he would shield a bribe behind a sponsorship opportunity, and that the trail would be traceable to Celtic Park, but only if you start out from the assumption that the Grand Conspiracy of the Unseen Fenian Hand is behind the voting.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">1 of 23</span><br><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Since almost all of them do believe the SPFL vote was designed solely to &ldquo;hand Celtic the title&rdquo; there was no way in Hell they weren&rsquo;t going to swallow this.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">It was like shooting fish in a barrel. So many of them are so eager to believe the worst, the very worst, that they leaped at this like a cat spotting a mouse peeking out of a hole in the skirting. And like said cat in every Tom and Jerry cartoon there is, they banged their heads on the wall instead.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">This lot are so dense they make osmium seem like Swiss cheese.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">One of those caught up in the net was our old friend The State Aid Loony who gobbled it up like the old lady who swallowed a fly. The moment he did his rabid followers started disseminating the story all over the forums.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Noted &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; voices &ldquo;confirmed&rdquo; the legitimacy of this barefaced and brazen fabrication, proving to all the word that they have none.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">It was a masterpiece of disinformation, and not because it was especially creative &ndash; although it certainly was &ndash; or particularly well executed, but because they so badly wanted to believe it they couldn&rsquo;t help themselves.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Lunacy and paranoia proliferate on their forums.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Think back to the incident involving Morelos&rsquo; car, back when that seemed important. Threads buzzed with dark rumours about how he had been targeted for assassination. And for what? Because he was threatening to score, at some point, in some match, against Celtic.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">It is madness.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Yet their fans clearly believed this.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">They clearly did think their player was in fear of his life because he had scored a few goals in the SPL and might score a handful more.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">No other explanation was even considered by some of them, and there were many possibilities.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">The same applied to the Jim Traynor &ldquo;assault&rdquo; about which nothing more has ever been heard &hellip; they believe that the rest of the world is venal and corrupt and capable of anything.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">It doesn&rsquo;t help that we have a media which panders to this nuttiness and often echoes it.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">None of the hacks latched onto this, not in print anyway, but it&rsquo;s clear that some of them were initially convinced; David Tanner, who was tweeting just the other day, wondering what inducements had been made to Dundee, clearly took the bait.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I would be amazed if others hadn&rsquo;t gotten all excited and feverishly tried to verify it.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">All of them expect Sevco to have some devastating information; we&rsquo;ll know by the end of the day if the top flight clubs are as convinced. I&rsquo;ll be doing a separate piece on that when we know more, but you have to remember that we&rsquo;re not the target audience here and the clubs aren&rsquo;t either.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">The target audience for whatever dodgy dossier the Ibrox board has come up with are their own supporters &hellip; the very Peepul who believed this forgery was real.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Is it any wonder they think they can convince their fans to buy into their claims?</span><br><span class="diffAdd">These Peepul will accept anything if it appears to confirm their twisted view of the world.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">If there really is a sucker born every minute, you have to marvel at how an inordinate number of them seem to wind up in Larkhall.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">As Scottish football goes through the current crisis it is important to keep up with developments and the key issues.
