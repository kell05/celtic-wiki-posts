Begun as a bunch of splitters from the old <a href="/page/Celtic+sites+-+Jungle+Bhoys" target="_self">Jungle Bhoys</a> supporters group, after a bit of disagreement over a joint anti-sectarianism banner with the Huns, the Green Brigade have made it clear that they are their own men (or boys!) and follow their own rules. <br><br>From the start they defined themselves very differently to the now defunct <a href="/page/Celtic+sites+-+Jungle+Bhoys" target="_self">Jungle Bhoys</a>. Markedly more belligerent in their tone than other Celtic groups, they are a left-wing politically, anti-fascist group and are supportive of a united Ireland and independent Scotland (in their words) etc etc. Cynics would say their politics are simplistic and crude (a longer argument for another day for someone else to take on) and sections of the Celtic support are deeply divided on their view on the group. E-tims described them once as &quot;<i>...about the best thing that&rsquo;s happened within the support in a very long time</i>&quot;, but others have said the contrary.<br><br>Their membership is generally quite young, although they have more than their fair share of overgrown teenagers in their forties, but in general the group appealed to younger Celts compared to the (now ended) <a href="/page/Celtic+sites+-+Jungle+Bhoys" target="_self">Jungle Bhoys</a>. Their mockingly militant aspect is another factor that attracts some people towards their group (as against the more benign culture of the <a href="/page/Celtic+sites+-+Jungle+Bhoys" target="_self">Jungle Bhoys</a>) but on occasion it can attract unwelcome people too. You just got to deal with them and in fairness the Green Brigade are strict on certain modes of behaviour especially on racism or bigotry. <br><br>They have been quite an active group. Whilst most others had spent countless hours debating and bemoaning the state of the atmosphere at Celtic Park and elsewhere, the Green Brigade have actually gone and done something about it. The variety and quality of their banners have been nothing less than astounding, and their humour them has been a great advert for the support. Some of their banners have related to various campaigns, such as memorials to the Irish Famine and protests about the exorbitant ticket prices at games, and whilst this area is obviously going to create friction at least it has created public debate on notable issues. <br><br>Their banners have even become of cult interest. Clever and smart, pictures of their banner displays have been posted all over the football world. In general, they have reflected the good humorous side of the club, the most famous display being the &quot;<i>Scotland&#39;s Shame</i>&quot; display targeting the Huns and the &quot;<i>Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</i>&quot; banner satirising Rangers liquidation. <br><br>A selection of their best banners can be seen in the following link. (Note we&#39;ve marked most of the banners that are the Green Brigade&#39;s work where possible).<br><br><ul><li>Link: <a href="/page/Banners+%26+Displays" target="_self">Banners  &amp; Displays</a></li></ul>The most successful aspect of the group is that they have helped to rejuvenate the atmosphere at games. Their main stronghold is a corner area of Parkhead, section 111 (referred to as the &#39;Green Brigade&#39; section, and from there the group and other like-minded supporters congregate at matches for chants and songs throughout the matches. They have helped to popularise old favourites and write some new songs along the way, notably the Boruc tunes and the St Pauli inspired &quot;We love you....&quot; song. In many ways if it wasn&#39;t for them, there might be little or no singing at Celtic whereas once the ground was famous for it. The Jungle Bhoys tried but results were less successful, so the Green Brigade deserve credit for their work.<br><br>Additionally, they have been a constant presence wherever Celtic may be. Their banners can be seen and found wherever we go, no matter whether the match is important or not. At a Peterborough friendly away in summer 2008, despite the game being an unattractive and meaningless friendly, they helped to generate a really great atmosphere on old style terracing (much to the delight of the older fans). <br><br>They&#39;ll even go to extremes: at the Rapid Vienna away game in 2009, the Green Brigade banner was clearly flown whilst whole loads of supporters were jumping around without their shirts on in temperatures of -8C! It was all in good fun and helped to build an atmosphere that was widely noticed throughout Europe and put the Vienna home fans in the shade. They definitely follow the old lines of &quot;<i>we&#39;ll go anywhere,... faithful through and through...</i>&quot;.<br><br><b>Stances</b><br>Despite being lauded for helping to regenerate matchday atmosphere there are criticisms. Unashamedly left-wing, the political aspect of the group leaves some a bit cold (many deem it unfit and irrelevant in the modern footballing environment). One retort is that critics are post-McCann fans which is patently laughable taking in the general age of many members of the Green Brigade. It&#39;s also been claimed that certain of their members start up singing of a number of old militant Irish tunes at away games, which is something that has the potential to cause the club serious problems with authorities (outwith of football as well as within). However this has been much on the wane and doesn&#39;t happen at Celtic Park at least.<br><br>One noticeable point is that they used to display their signature banner upside down at matches! The reasoning is that it&#39;s a common standard amongst Ultra groups in Europe in protesting against any of their own club&#39;s decisions. In this case it was over the appointment of John Reid as chairman of the club. People can view this as they want, but the Green Brigade take it as a political stance, vehemently opposed to his appointment as he was a minister in the UK Government that took the country into the war in Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000&#39;s. <br><br>Due to their stances, it&#39;s inevitable that they would run into conflict with the club, and this has meant various headaches which again can be left for a wider discussion elsewhere. The Green Brigade did state in their original notice (re-printed below) that they are not willing to co-operate with the PLC board, not exactly helpful. Must note that not all the trouble is necessarily their fault, and any flare ups are usually worsened by people wading in from nowhere just for the sake of it, and so matters spiral out of control. The job of the stewards is tough enough for some. In truth, the Green Brigade have hardly pushed on many of their more tougher stances and they have mainly concentrated on issues surrounding the support and the atmosphere at games.<br><br>Celtic is more than a club and doesn&#39;t follow the clich&eacute; that the phrase has become for some. Throughout the history of the club, the support has had a general antipathy to establishment culture and have been at the forefront of causes against oppression. Times have changed, but the support for valid causes is still an essential aspect of our culture. The Green Brigade are another offshoot of this (whether you agree with their methods or not). <br><br><b>Charge of the Green Brigade</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Banner - Pic" height="296" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/0s_-hS1PtTjU6k8JPL3Tjg65434/GW447H296" title="Banner - Pic" width="447"></h3>Despite cynicism, the Green Brigade managed to build on their early successes, and to help turnaround a fall in the attendances at games (following two poor seasons), and in 2010 the Green Brigade managed to obtain Section 111 of the ground (around corner of the Lisbon Lions Stand/North stand), and have built up a strong base of regulars who have helped rejuvenate the support. This is a notable action as proves that the club management (&amp; board) have been fair and assisting the support despite whinges to the contrary. Many people began to openly applaud the Green Brigade and state that they were very much more enjoying going to games now due to the better atmosphere at games as created by the Green Brigade.<br><br>They have planted themselves into the support and they will be around for a long time to come. Many youngsters are attracted to them and it has nothing to do with any supposed crude politics. The singing, the colour and the humour from the group has been wonderful and at their best have made match experiences a joy (much better than the constant moaning that has been the norm from one or two other sections of the crowd).<br><br>If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then the Green Brigade should be chuffed as replica groups (The Comrades/The Rude Bhoys) sprang up on the other side of the ground (Section 122) mirroring them in many ways. Although they couldn&#39;t compete and sadly both ended not long after forming. Hell, even Rangers fans created a version (The Blue Order or The Blue Odour as some dub them) and have even stolen some of the Green Brigade&#39;s tunes &amp; actions! Laughable.<br><br>Into 2011/12, more than established within the support, the club have used images from their displays for commercial promotional exercises. The group&#39;s songs have become staples not only in their section but across the ground. They have became the centre for generating atmosphere in the support and for that all should truly respect them. Their songs are now the standard across the support, and the mass &quot;<a href="/page/The+Huddle" target="_self">Huddle</a>&quot; which they began at Celtic is replicated across the stadium during the most important matches.<br><br>If one moment more than any othersealed the Green Brigade&#39;s success then it will be from the last league game of the 2011/12 season. Celtic were handed the league trophy for the title, and Neil Lennon later walked over to the GB&#39;s corner and placed the trophy in front of them, stepped back and applauded them. It was respect for their support (vocal and visual) throughout the season both at home and away, and a touching tribute to their efforts. Some sections criticised Lennon for this believing it was unfair to single the GB out, but that was churlish in light of what they had achieved. On the other hand, is this acceptance by the club officials? Surely the GBprefer to be &quot;rebels&quot; and &quot;outsiders&quot;? Joking aside, they deserved their moment as much as the team players and management.<br><br>Not all plain sailing. In Aug 2013, after repeated warnings the club closed down the Green Brigade section 111 and started to relocate the supporters to other areas. Two sides to the story, but elements covered smoke flares, &#39;lateral movement&#39;, health &amp; safety etc. All a difficult situation, but resolved without any matches with the area reopened in the end. See <a href="/page/Controversies+-+Green+Brigade+Section+111+closed+by+Celtic+FC+%28temporarily%29+%282013%29" target="_self">Link</a>. However, matters flared again later in the season and they were papped out again, and then allowed back and so on.<br><br>In season 2015/16, their section was converted to terracing, the first for a senior club in the UK since the Hillsborough disaster (RIP). The Green Brigade had the honour to prove it could work and was acceptable in modern football, and to date they have been a great example, adding colour and noise, so much so that clubs throughout the UK began looking at aping our new terracing section. Many clubs in the UK and even some in Europe have descended to Celtic Park to examine the terracing system as popularised by the Green Brigade to implement this system in their grounds, so the Green Brigade have been trailblazers.<br><br>In season 2016/7, following a dispute with the Celtic board, again the &#39;Green Brigade&#39; section of the ground (as the club officially even now called it) was closed by the club for following two <font color="#000000">games after &#39;serious incidents of unsafe behaviour&#39;, due to pyros and stuff. Mainly problem was concerns due to building number of charges from UeFA.<br><br>In Aug 2017, the GB made a name for themselves globally with a display of Palestinian flags in their end when playing against Hapoel Be&#39;er Shiva in the European Cup qualifiers. There was concern of UEFA fines etc but a &pound;10k fine was covered by a fund raiser online with the money going to peaceful Palestinian support groups, and even Roger Waters of legendary group Pink Floyd coming out in support </font><font color="#000000">and used the imagery on the big screens in his concerts.<br><br>In Oct 2019, in a Celtic v Lazio match, their banners mocking the fascist deposed deposed Mussolini led to his non-entity grandaughter &amp; politician Alessandra Mussolini claiming &quot;<a href="/page/Ducephobia" target="_self">Duceophobia</a>&quot; which was to be laughed at &amp; much satirised as it went viral. She wanted Celtic charged for the banners. The Green Brigade replied with a banner of &quot;<i>Alessandra Vanfuncolo</i>&quot;.</font><br><br><br><br><br><br>As long as the Green Brigade focus on invigorating the Celtic matchday experience, they&#39;ll do well. We all have an opinion on them (and many have strong words to say on them) but being outsiders is part of their appeal for their members.

Not subtle, but then subtlety wasn&rsquo;t in  the plan. Down the other end of the stadium another collection of Celts  held up signs with the word Goodbye written in a dozen different  languages.
