Celtic had never before had a 10-game unbeaten run across the country&rsquo;s three major competitions in facing up to an Ibrox opponent and there has never been such a 10 in the Premier era that began in 1975-76 and ushered in four league meetings a season - but Rodgers secured the accolade this weekend</li><li>Police chiefs have instructed football bosses to avoid a potential league title decider between Celtic and Rangers. Cops warned that the fixture, originally planned for the weekend of April 21/22 should be put back a week amid safety fears if Celtic do clinch a seventh consecutive title. <br></li><li>Celtic are hoping to push on with plans for a match day fan zone area for supporters by buying up a patch of land near their Parkhead stadium.The council-owned land, currently derelict, is located on Janefield Street and is used as a car park. Glasgow City Council have owned the land since the 1940s, and Celtic are hopeful of securing ownership of the space to push ahead with the project, which has been in the works for some time. Good idea long proposed by many who have experienced this in away matches in Europe.<br></li> <li>Sir Billy Connolly has described himself as the &ldquo;least patriotic man in the world&rdquo; and said he dislikes people who &ldquo;write England off because they&rsquo;re Scottish&rdquo;. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the least patriotic man in the world. I do love Scotland, but if the love for your country is all you have, you&rsquo;re in a desperate state. &ldquo;I dislike people that write England off because they&rsquo;re Scottish. It&rsquo;s unfair and &shy;brutal.&rdquo;<br></li><li>Ex-Partick Thistle manager John Lambie has passed away. A great character in the game who epitomised much about Scottish football, he will be missed.

The 38-year-old is expected to be paid off after a bust-up with Graeme Murty in the aftermath of Sunday&rsquo;s Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Celtic, while Wallace has also been hammered for an angry post-match outburst.

They  can cheer as much as they want. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be cheering  tonight.&quot; <br>Scott Brown<br><br>(Graham Speirs - Journalist)<br>Utter humiliation for Rangers today at Hampden. Treated with contempt by  Celtic. The root of it is not Graeme Murty&rsquo;s fault: a youth coach  placed in charge by an Ibrox board singularly incapable of giving their  team and its supporters a manager. A straightforward incompetence.<br><br>&ldquo;The pressure is always there, you can&rsquo;t try and hide from it or pretend  it is not there. You carry the responsibility for millions of  supporters, your players, your club, your board. It is there. It is not  going away.&quot; <br>Brendan Rodgers<br><br>Pre-match: &quot;The sound that came out of our changing room when the draw came through  was raucous and loud. I think that is indicative of where the squad  are, they&#39;re flowing with confidence just now.&quot; <br>Graeme Murty<br><br>&ldquo;That was a game that they <span class="diffRemove">[Rangers]</span><span class="diffAdd">[Sevco]</span> cheered for but you should be careful what you wish for in case it comes back to bite you on the a**e,&rdquo; <br>Leigh Griffiths.<br><br><br><br>(Wilfred Benitez15 of KDS)<br><div>That was our most one-sided victory against them in memory.<br><br>At absolutely no point did it look even remotely competitive.<br><br>Even in the two recent 5-1 games, the 6-2 game and the 5-1 Lubo game, they had fleeting moments of competitiveness.<br><br>The  nearest one-sided example I can think of is the 3-0 game at Ibrox  (Larsson 2, Lubo 1) and even then they threatened at times.<br><br>This was a slapping good and proper.<br><br>And Moreles is properly, undisputedly sheeeeet!!!</div><br>(cjthunderbird of KDS)<br>My top pish myself laughing moments from watching it on telly today.<br><br>1. The Morales miss.  That was after I was already laughing at their best chance coming from a skewed clearance off our own defender&#39;s shin.  I almost pished myself.<br><br>2.  Graham Dorrans trying to wind up Broony in the first half.  What a useless, boneheaded tactic that was.<br><br>3.  Bobby Madden having to give two penalties to Celtic.  And Demb&eacute;l&eacute; scored one with a chip. The other he gave away it was such a scoosh to him.<br><br>4.  The text I got from my mate asking what time I wanted in the sweep for Halliday to get hooked or sent off.  Then a text 30 seconds later saying &quot;Never mind&quot;.  Then watching Halliday call Murty a effing bawbag on live telly as he got marshalled to his seat through a Rangers bench of the most miserable looking bunch I&#39;ve ever seen.<br><br>5.  The triangles that the Celtic defence passed round Morales for far too long before he realised what was happening and about punched himself in the face for getting taken for a floof. <br><br><br>(levzhalliday of KDS forum)<br>What a result yesterday, don&#39;t think it could have gone better! Shame we only scored 4...<br><br> - Gordon stepped up when it mattered<br> - Brown absolutely untouchable. When he won that 50/50 and the started swaggering away, unreal stuff<br> - C Mac is maybe one of the most underrated Celtic players<br> - Rogic proving again he&#39;s a big game player<br> - Dembele absolutely rag dolled their defenders, his hold up play was brilliant. That penalty<br> - Griffiths winding them up with the ball on his head, oh my days<br> - Ntcham&#39;s penalty was perfect<br> - Lost it when the Celtic fans were chanting &quot;Andy Halliday, Halliday, Andy Halliday&quot; hahaha!<br><br>This was the game they cheered for, absolutely comical stuff. Game by game it&#39;s becoming clear to them just how far behind us they really are. Murty has obviously lost the dressing room, they&#39;re capitulating fast. Morelos is a total donkey and couldn&#39;t finish a bag of Starburst. His near greeting face when he missed his chances honestly fills me with utter joy. Some Rangers fans comparing Dorrans to Brown, outrageous! <br><br>It&#39;s getting to the point where they may need us to win the cup so they can get European football, you honestly cannot write this.<br><br>One of the greatest times to be a Celtic fan and I am absolutely loving it!<br><br>(fatboab of KDS)<br><br><div>Just home from a long weekend away, and watched the entire 90 minutes for the first time. Man, they are abject. That was as bad a performance as anything I&rsquo;ve seen from any team playing out of Ibrox since the halcyon days of Gregor Stevens, and even then it would take some beating. They couldn&rsquo;t get near us, and apart from our brain fart 10 minutes after we scored the third, we totally dominated that game with utter contempt. <br><br>Ntcham and Brown ran the show, Dembele bossed them , and the trio of Rogic , Forrest and McGregor picked them off at will. We didn&rsquo;t get out of second gear in the second half and still murdered them.<br><br>This , hopefully, will be the game that kills Hun Mark II. It&rsquo;s impossible to see how they compete with us , and that is all they live to do.

You&rsquo;d be stopping the album 21 seconds before Robert Plant told you about the lady who knows all that glitters is gold.<br>If you watched just the first 15 minutes of Goodfellas, you&rsquo;d drop out moments before learning why they called Jimmy Two-Times Jimmy Two-Times.<br><br>Give up 15 minutes into Breaking Bad and you&rsquo;ve just watched a bizarre short film about a chemistry teacher who enjoys driving a Winnebago in his pants.<br><br>All of which is to say that 15 minutes is no time at all. Spend just 15 minutes on most activities and, chances are, at least 50% of those involved will leave unsatisfied. Apparently, though, that&rsquo;s how much build-up Sky &lsquo;SPFL sort of to an extent within reason MATTERS&rsquo; Sports felt a cup semi-final between the country&rsquo;s two biggest clubs in our national stadium merited. Fifteen minutes that included TWO ad breaks, just in case we&rsquo;d all forgotten to be #GambleLads in time for kick off. In fairness to Sky, it was still more preparation than Rangers put in.<br><br>As the line-ups were revealed, it was a case of &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the goalie daein&rsquo;?&rsquo; against &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the goalie Bain?&rsquo; The selection of Craig Gordon was to prove one of many correct calls by Brendan Rodgers, as the keeper&rsquo;s acrobatics during those seven second-half minutes when Rangers turned up were the difference between pulling off an embarrassing spanking and having to settle for a comfortable doing.<br><br>Brendan Rodgers was frustrated during the game&rsquo;s early exchanges as a balloon got in the way of his team&rsquo;s play, but that&#39;s precisely what Graeme Murty told Andy Halliday to do. Ah yes, Andy &lsquo;Ardy Flallibae&rsquo; Halliday.<br><br>When Halliday&rsquo;s name appeared on the teamsheet, you could feel the scales tipping away from &lsquo;Cohesive Rangers performance&rsquo; and towards &lsquo;Banter Years&rsquo;. This wasn&rsquo;t, however, your average Andy Halliday disappointment. This was a subbed before the break, tantrum in front of the fans, name sung by the Celtic supporters Andy Halliday disappointment. One for the ages, in other words.<br><br>After stamping his lack of authority on the first 40 minutes, Halliday was unceremoniously yanked. As he headed to his seat, he received abuse from a Rangers fan and retaliated by calling him a &ldquo;F**king bawbag&rdquo;. Sky pundit Kris Commons admitted he could understand Halliday&rsquo;s frustration but insisted footballers should be saving their outbursts for the dressing room, a point I believe he once made to Ronny Deila and John Collins in Norway.<br><br>As he eventually took his seat, the midfielder finally achieved his lifelong dream of being serenaded by appreciative fans during a (there is no) Old Firm derby. Unfortunately, the fans in question were sporting green and white, and there was no hiding place for Halliday as thousands broke into &ldquo;Na na na na na na na na na na na, Andy Halliday, Halliday, Andy Halliday&rdquo;, to the tune of &lsquo;Give It Up&rsquo; by KC &amp; The Sunshine Band. &lsquo;Give It Up&rsquo; coincidentally being Halliday&rsquo;s approach to possession during the first half.<br>Celtic supporters didn&rsquo;t have it all their own way though. Goals, songs and a touch of schadenfreude made for a good day out, but there was one crucial component of the derby experience missing.<br><br>The 90 minutes provided plenty of action for the Rangers TV commentary team to get initially excited and progressively more subdued about. Tom Rogic opened the scoring before Callum McGregor doubled Celtic&rsquo;s advantage. McGregor took the plaudits, but you had to admire the composure and vision of Russell Martin to pick out his man in a crowded box.<br><br>Rangers were handed a lifeline known as the &lsquo;Barry Ferguson Advantage&rsquo; when Ross McCrorie&rsquo;s foul in the box reduced his side to 10 men. Bobby Madden showed no hesitation in brandishing the red card, before booking Bobby Madden for dissent. Moussa Dembele coolly dinked the resultant penalty home. &ldquo;Dembele&rsquo;s impudent&rdquo; declared co-commentator Andy Walker, prompting pundit Kris Boyd to remark &ldquo;Sh**e news for his missus&rdquo;. Olivier Ntcham&rsquo;s penalty rounded off a victory which had Celtic fans casting their minds back to the semi-final draw, and the reaction of Rangers fans in particular.<br><br>Footage of Rangers supporters celebrating the semi-final draw went viral last month, followed by Graeme Murty&rsquo;s description of a &ldquo;raucous and loud&rdquo; reaction in his dressing room. Scott Brown was asked about the clip in a post-match interview. It was a delicate assist of a question, and Brown tucked it home with aplomb as he told viewers that &ldquo;They can cheer as much as they want. I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be cheering tonight&rdquo;. A cheap shot maybe, but anyone associated with Rangers who genuinely expected to win this match needs to be sat down immediately with a comprehensive anthology of the Banter Years.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s official Twitter account also got a subtle dig in, referring not to Rangers but to &ldquo;the Ibrox side&rdquo; in a tweet during the build-up. A deflated atmosphere among the Rangers support meant there was no defiant cry of &ldquo;We are the Ibrox side, super the Ibrox side&hellip;&rdquo;. It was only the weekend&rsquo;s second most passive-aggressive tweet, however, behind the official Aberdeen account&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jst h8 it wen CERTAIN ppl bottle it at Hampden&rdquo;.<br><br>Celtic will go on to face Stephen Robinson&rsquo;s Motherwell side in the final, after Derek McInnes proved he was not concomitant with silverware. McInnes did at least defy the &#39;he&#39;s run out of ideas&#39; critics, by bottling it against a team that isn&#39;t Celtic or Rangers.<br><br>As for Sky, now the semis are out the road they can get back to the red-hot intensity of English football, where compelling title races and fierce rivalry are the order of the day.

Morelos and Docherty went for each other and it was just as well there were enough people around to split them up before things got completely out of hand.<br>&ldquo;To make matters even more embarrassing some of Celtic&rsquo;s backroom team were present at the time and they saw what went on.&rdquo;<br><br>It&rsquo;s understood there were more heated exchanges inside the Rangers dressing room as tempers boiled over after a humiliating defeat to the champions.<br>Andy Halliday was also seen shouting in the direction of manager Graeme Murty after being substituted before the break, shortly after Celtic had romped into a 2-0 lead.<br><br>Murty insisted he would let the dust settle before speaking to the player as he apologised for the Hampden horrorshow.<br>The manager added: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been happy. I completely understand his frustration but I was reacting to a situation in the game and I was looking at a different shape to the team.<br>&ldquo;Andy&rsquo;s frustrated but I&rsquo;ll see him in the week and have a chat and take things from there.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a frustration thing. If you deal with people in an emotional state, you get an emotional response.&rdquo;<br><br>Murty admitted he experienced the lowest point of his career as he watched Celtic hammer his team.<br>The Ibrox boss refused to discuss his own future in the wake of his side&rsquo;s abject display which saw them play the last 40 minutes with 10 men after young Ross McCrorie was red carded for bringing down Moussa Dembele for a penalty which gifted Celtic their third goal.<br>Pointedly, Murty also refused to answer if he felt his side had let him down but he admitted he couldn&rsquo;t blame the support for walking out on them long before the end of the capitulation, which had earlier seen him hook Andy Halliday before the break - a decision which prompted a furious reaction from the recalled midfielder.<br>The Rangers manager said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lonely place standing on the sidelines when that&rsquo;s going on. I don&rsquo;t think words are enough to convey how I&rsquo;m feeling right now.<br>&ldquo;I would apologise to the fans for the game. I would ask for the patience and ask them to keep believing but we can&rsquo;t keep asking it.<br><br>&ldquo;We have to put a performance on worthy of their support. We didn&rsquo;t do enough to make them want to stay in the stadium today.<br>&ldquo;There was emotion, anger, disappointment in the dressing room &ndash; all the things you would expect after a game like that.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about putting all of them into positives to power you through to the end of the season.<br>&ldquo;But this is the worst I have ever felt in my career, without a doubt.&rdquo;<br>Asked why Rangers had gone down so meekly, Murty admitted he didn&rsquo;t have an answer.<br>He said: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of things to look at. I don&rsquo;t think we got close enough to them. We didn&rsquo;t put them under enough pressure and allowed them to play through us too easily. <br>&ldquo;All four goals were easily avoidable just through basic, good defending and in the second half, we gave them the penalty and sending off which makes their job far, far easier.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look at it. There are things we can all get better at but it&rsquo;s too raw right now to go into it. We&rsquo;ll look at it in the cold light of day.<br>&ldquo;We were just passive. I don&rsquo;t know why. I asked them to get into a shape and the structure was there to allow them to go and press but when it comes to the game, you have to get up closer to your opponent than we did in the first period.<br>&ldquo;It seems to be the case at times that we&rsquo;ve had really good opportunities to claw something back from the game and we haven&rsquo;t managed to do it. I&rsquo;ve said we have to be clinical in both boxes and I don&rsquo;t think we managed to do that at all today. Craig made a couple of good saves but we should have scored at least one. I know it&rsquo;s scant consolation right now but we were not worthy of getting anything from the game today.&rdquo;<br>Despite the defeat - this was the 10th game running that Rangers had failed to beat their rivals - the Ibrox gaffer remains adamant that there&rsquo;s no mental block about facing Celtic.<br>He said: &ldquo;No not at all. There is belief in the squad that they can challenge Celtic but I didn&rsquo;t feel it today, not in the first half.<br><br>&ldquo;I felt it in the last game at home but that belief keeps getting challenged and we have to step up.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our job to make sure this doesn&rsquo;t have a bearing in the final league games.<br>&ldquo;The players need to respond &ndash; not just against Celtic. There are big games ahead of us and we have to get a response between now and the end of the season of we want to finish as we should.&rdquo;<br>But when asked if he can see how the gulf between the two Glasgow clubs can be closed, he answered: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the million dollar question isn&rsquo;t it? You need really good recruitment, really good tactics and with more passion and belief than we showed today.&rdquo;<br><br>So did the players let him down? By not answering, he answered it, even if all he said was: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to answer that one. You&rsquo;ll have to ask the players. We all need to have a look at our contributions.&rdquo;<br>There is now a huge doubt over whether he&rsquo;ll be given the opportunity to try to close the gap but yesterday Murty wasn&rsquo;t prepared to discuss that, saying: &ldquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to talk about my role. I think it would be churlish and selfish to talk about my own situation.&rdquo;<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>BBC<br><br>Celtic took a huge step towards  securing back-to-back trebles as they ruthlessly swept Rangers aside to  reach the Scottish Cup final.<br>Celtic were commanding against passive opponents, with Tom Rogic and Callum McGregor scoring before half-time.<br>Rangers&#39;  woes worsened after the break, with Ross McCrorie dismissed for pulling  back Moussa Dembele, who converted the resulting penalty.<br>Olivier Ntcham added the fourth, also from the spot, before the end.<br>With  Dembele hitting the post early on, Ntcham firing wide and McGregor  driving over, the scoreline might have been more emphatic for Celtic.<br><br>Rangers gathered only frustration and angst, with Andy Halliday  hollering his frustration from the bench after being replaced by Josh  Windass before half-time, and Daniel Candeias heading straight up the  tunnel after he was substituted.<br>Celtic are now one league win  away from retaining their seventh consecutive Premiership title, and  face Motherwell in next month&#39;s Scottish Cup final, having already  secured the League Cup last November.<br>Football matches are won and lost in a variety of ways. It is arguable that Rangers lost this one before kick-off.<br>Tactically, Rangers manager Graeme Murty appeared to get it wrong, and played into Celtic&#39;s hands. How they exploited it.<br>A  midfield three sat deep to cater for James Forrest, McGregor and Rogic,  a trio of sprightly attacking midfielders. It backfired spectacularly.<br>Celtic, in contrast, looked sharp from the off and almost took the lead when Dembele volleyed Ntcham&#39;s cross off the upright.<br>Rangers escaped, but it was the briefest of respites. Brendan Rodgers&#39; side swarmed forward, exploiting Rangers&#39; timid approach.<br>The  opener soon arrived, when Dembele ran in behind and laid back for  Forrest who found Rogic inside the box. The Australian, with typical  poise, swivelled away from McCrorie and found the corner of the net with  a smooth finish.<br>Rogic is a big talent who delivers on the big  stage; he has now scored a goal in each of his three Old Firm  appearances this season.<br>He had a better opportunity moments  later, but fired straight at Wes Foderingham with Rangers looking  increasingly ragged. They were being brutally ripped apart.<br>Celtic&#39;s movement was impressive. They were determined and crisp in  their passing. Scott Brown and Ntcham were allowed to stroll around  midfield with quite startling ease.<br>They bossed this, and added a second when Kieran Tierney danced past Candeias and crossed towards Dembele.<br>Russell  Martin&#39;s body shape was all wrong as he tried to intervene and he  haplessly skewed the ball straight to McGregor, who finished  emphatically beyond Foderingham.<br>At that point, it seemed an abacus might be required to keep count of the chances and goals Celtic might rack up.<br>Murty had to confront the reality of the situation, and he chose to  replace Halliday before half-time. It was a horrible moment for the  midfielder, but only added to the glee of the Celtic support.<br>That  joy improved further after the break when McCrorie failed to cope with  Dembele&#39;s power and pace, pulling the Celtic striker down in the box. It  was a chastening afternoon for the young Rangers defender, who had no  answer to Dembele&#39;s strength and guile.<br>McCrorie was ordered off before the Celtic striker cheekily dinked the spot kick away from Foderingham.<br>Rangers  did improve for a spell, and had three glorious chances in succession.  All three fell to Alfredo Morelos, but Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon  produced three wonderful stops to deny him. <br>Celtic&#39;s threat eased a touch with the game over as a contest, but  they still added a fourth when Rangers substitute Jason Holt clattered  into Patrick Roberts inside the box.<br>Ntcham took this one, and confidently drilled home into the corner.<br>That  put the seal on a thrilling afternoon for Celtic, who moved ever closer  to the historic achievement of back-to-back trebles.<br>For Rangers, this was a bruising occasion. One that will leave them with lingering hurt and significant questions to answer.<div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Celtic 4, Rangers 0.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+4&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Celtic 4, Rangers 0.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Booking</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">James Tavernier (Rangers) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Callum McGregor (Celtic) wins a free kick in the defensive half.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Foul by James Tavernier (Rangers).</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 87&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt missed.
