At one point he was to make a high profile move to Marseille until injury struck and hampered his career progress. <br><br>So he arrived in Glasgow, with something to prove to many. That would all change when Lubo made his debut in a 6-1 demolition of Dundee at Celtic Park on November 7th. The Slovakian midfield ace displayed an array of sublime touches and suddenly the Celtic support sensed that here was a very special talent.<br><br>The magnificence of Moravcik was confirmed in the sweetest fashion just a fortnight later when he scored twice and inspired his new club to a 5-1 thrashing of old rivals Rangers at Parkhead. The legend that is Lubo was born.<br><br>Moravcik seemed to have it all. Quick feet, wonderful vision and an eye for goal. Equally comfortable with his left or right foot Lubo possessed a level of skill not seen at Celtic Park &ndash; or in Scotland &ndash; for many years. His tricks and flicks were a joy to watch but in addition to being a supreme football entertainer Moravcik had a real cutting edge to his game and was much more than just a show pony. <br><br>Truth is that despite his talents there were many a game where he just drifted, and during the dark season under Barnes/Dalglish, he may have been a bright spark amongst most of the gloom back then but he was just as culpable for the poor results and performances as many others.<br><br>Despite his abundance of ability Lubo had never won a major trophy in his long career but that was to change at Celtic with the Slovakian playing a major part in securing honours for the Bhoys and re-establishing the side as the dominant force in Scotland.<br><br>It might have been the pragmatic skills of inspirational manager Martin O&rsquo;Neill which ultimately toppled Rangers from their perch but it was the skills of Lubo and Henrik Larsson which ensured they did it with panache and style.<br><br>Nowhere was this better illustrated than at Ibrox on 29 April 2001. Celtic had already sealed the Championship and Rangers had made it known they were determined to show the Bhoys that they were really still top dogs. Moravcik slaughtered them in their own backyard. He scored two wonderful second-half goals in a 3-0 triumph in which during the second 45 minutes the Lubo inspired Celts to simply and mercilessly destroy their vastly outclassed rivals.<br><br>Celtic won the treble and the next season &ndash; Lubo&rsquo;s last in the Hoops &ndash; retained the league as Moravcik finally had a chance to parade his skills on the biggest stage &ndash; the Champions League. He didn&rsquo;t disappoint but even he couldn&rsquo;t prevent Celtic&rsquo;s unlucky exit from the group stage. <br><br>In many ways, he was underused in his last season with some arguing that Martin O&#39;Neill did not know how to use flair players. Nevertheless, Lubo&#39;s entry onto the pitch was usually at vital stages in order to hold the ball, slow the tempo and retain possession.<br><br>Lubo left Celtic in the summer of 2002 for JEF Ichihara in Japan after four years, 129 appearances and 35 goals. While at Celtic Park he won two league titles, a Scottish Cup and two League Cups.<br><br>But even the most impressive of statistics can never do justice to the skills of Moravcik. He was a joy to watch and the memory of his performances will live long in the minds of the Celtic support.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows

He would tell me: &lsquo;Lubo, I do not want to see you come back and take the ball from the centre-backs and play the easy pass. I want you near the penalty box to make passes and score goals. This is your job for the team.&rsquo;&quot; He added: &ldquo;Martin was clear with me: &#39;If you do that, I kick you up the bum&rsquo;.&quot;<br><b>Lubo on manager <a href="/page/O%27Neill%2C+Martin" target="_self">Martin O&#39;Neill</a> (2010)<br></b><br>&ldquo;My favourite time, my most special time, was at Celtic. I spent more than three and a half years there and I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for more. People appreciated me and, maybe, some fans even loved me. They said I was a &lsquo;gift from God&rsquo; but it was the opposite &ndash; Celtic was a gift from God to me.<br>&ldquo;Celtic is unique. I left the club in 2002 but I haven&rsquo;t been forgotten. When I am on holiday in Spain, playing golf, the Celtic supporters approach me and ask for a photo or to talk about Celtic. It still amazes me.<br>&ldquo;As a kid growing up I wanted to play in the World Cup for my country. I was then lucky to play in an Old Firm game. We beat Rangers 5-1 at Parkhead in 1998 under Dr Venglos. When the Champions League started in 1992 I wanted to play in it for a club. Celtic gave me that opportunity.<br>&ldquo;The most memorable occasion was when I played against Juventus in the Champions League. We won 4-3. Martin O&rsquo;Neill gave me my first start in that tournament. I made the most of the moment. I was subbed near the end and I will never forget the standing ovation I received from the Celtic supporters. I am very lucky.<br>&ldquo;I was never a big goalscorer during my career. I scored some nice ones but there isn&rsquo;t really one that sticks out for me. It really is hard to choose. I enjoyed setting up my team-mates, whether it was with my right foot or my left foot. I know Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton and John Hartson appreciated it. That made me feel happy.<br>&quot;We had great success under Martin. The club had had a difficult couple of years for different reasons but we had good players and he got the best out of us. He transformed Stiliyan Petrov and Johan Mjallby.&rdquo;<br><b>Lubo reminiscing on his 50th birthday (2015)</b><br><br>&ldquo;You wonder where he has been hiding all these years. Lubo is the most-two footed player in Europe, his talent is amazing. His contribution to the Treble-winning team was absolutely immense and I was delighted that he signed for one more season to play in the Champions League.&ldquo;He remains one of the most gifted footballers I have ever seen or worked with and considering I played with many excellent players at club and international level, I cannot pay him any greater compliment than that. In only a short period of time at Celtic Park he has become as big a hero as any of the Lisbon Lions of 1967. He must have done something special to have warranted such acclaim.&rdquo;<br><b>Martin O&#39;Neill (2015)</b><br><div></div><div><br>&quot;One of the greatest 10&#39;s in football.&quot; </div><div><b>French World Cup winner &amp; legend Zinedan Zidane on Lubo Moravcik</b></div><div></div><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always nice to be out on the pitch but when you play Rangers and you manage to beat them 5-1 that&rsquo;s a great experience and I&rsquo;m happy for Lubo that he made his derby debut that way because it always makes it a little bit easier.&rsquo;&ldquo;I don&#39;t think you could ever replace Lubo, even if you had loads and loads of money to spend. It&#39;s going to be hard to replace him, almost impossible I think, because you don&#39;t get players like that around very often.&rdquo;<br><b>Henrik Larsson (2015)</b> <br><br>&ldquo;I don&#39;t think there was ever a more skilful player in my time at the club. He&#39;s the most talented two-footed player I&#39;ve ever played with and it&#39;s incredible the things he could do. He&#39;s a great player and a great entertainer.&ldquo;You don&#39;t get a higher compliment when someone like Zinedine Zidane says he is probably one of the best No.10s that he had ever seen.&rdquo;<br><b>Paul Lambert (2015)</b><br><br>&ldquo;For most people it would understandably be Henrik, who was a fantastic player, but in my opinion it would be have to be Lubo Moravcik.

The Celtic connection and memories of the League Cup, though, will not be far away.<br><br>Moravcik will speak warmly about Martin O&#39;Neill, the manager who many felt got the best out of the Slovak during his four years in Glasgow and with whom he celebrated a League Cup success in 2001.<br><br>He will recall playing alongside Stiliyan Petrov, now with O&#39;Neill at Villa as they push for a Champions League place next season, his team-mate when Celtic triumphed in the tournament in 2000 and who only missed out on repeating the feat a year later due to a broken leg.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s 2-0 win over Aberdeen in March 2000, the goals scored by Vidar Riseth and Tommy Johnson, was a rare bright spot that season.<br><br>The infamous Scottish Cup exit to Inverness had brought a swift end to John Barnes&#39; reign at Parkhead, while Dick Advocaat&#39;s Rangers would canter to the SPL title by 21 points. The CIS Insurance Cup success was seized on by fans in the hope it may signal a bright new era, albeit with the team under the temporary charge of Kenny Dalglish.<br><br>For Moravcik it carried extra significance. The talented Slovak was in the autumn of a wandering career by the time Dr Jozef Venglos brought him to Celtic Park in November 1998, after years of relatively unrewarded service with FC Nitra, St Etienne, Bastia, and MSV Duisburg. Victory over Aberdeen belatedly earned Moravcik his first senior medal at the age of 34. Little wonder, then, that the moment remains embedded in the his mind.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t remember much about the match itself but I know we beat Aberdeen 2-0 and it was my very first medal,&quot; he told The Herald. &quot;It was a very special moment for me to get my first trophy and celebrate in front of all our supporters. It had been a difficult season for us.<br><br>&quot;John Barnes had been sacked and Kenny Dalglish had not long taken over as manager. We knew Rangers were going to win the league so we wanted to get something from a bad season. I had scored in the semi-final so I felt I had played my part. The final was not a very exciting game but we won.&quot;<br><br>If that success was a consolation prize, the defence of the trophy the following season would become part of something much greater and more significant. Celtic, reinvigorated under O&#39;Neill, were a far different prospect to the side that had been shorn of all confidence under Barnes and Dalglish. The 2001 CIS Cup semi-final against Rangers, though, proved to be something of a mixed bag for Moravcik.<br><br>Celtic powered through to the final with a 3-1 win but Moravcik was sent off in the final few minutes, along with Michael Mols and Claudio Reyna of Rangers. He lets out a small chuckle as he recalls that evening at Hampden.<br><br>&quot;I was a bad boy that night,&quot; he added. &quot;I had not been on long as a substitute when I got involved in something right at the end of the game. I remember there was a bad tackle and all of a sudden everyone was pushing and fighting. I can&#39;t remember how but I was in the middle of it all like Zorro. I was sent off which was a shame because we had just had a great victory. Luckily, I was able to play in the final.&quot;<br><br>If the semi-final had been frantic, then the final against Kilmarnock was an anti-climax. Not for the first time, the day belonged to Henrik Larsson, who bagged the match ball in a 3-0 saunter.<br><br>While the previous success was simply a case of salvaging an otherwise disastrous season, lifting the trophy in 2001 set the platform for an impressive clean sweep.<br><br>&quot;The league cup is nice to win in its own right,&quot; Moravcik added. &quot;But when you win it then it gives you extra confidence. We did not say anything at the time but maybe we started to think there was a chance we could win the treble.&quot;<br><br>Moravcik continues to follow Celtic&#39;s fortunes from afar. He was surprised, if not shocked, to hear about his old team&#39;s Scottish Cup exit to St Mirren last weekend, and relatively unimpressed with the goalless draw served up in the last Old Firm meeting.<br><br>&quot;The last game against Rangers was not easy to watch,&quot; he said. &quot;I hope it will be a better match on Sunday. I have to commentate on the Aston Villa game but I will have one ear ready for any news from Glasgow.&quot;<br><br><i>By GRAEME MACPHERSON</i><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Celtic&#39;s Dr Venglos defends his signing of 33-year-old Slovakian midfielder Moravcik will have to fight for team place</h3>The Herald   <br>Ian Paul<br>Thursday 29 October 1998<br><br>CELTIC&#39;S new man from Slovakia, Lubomir Moravcik, will not be guaranteed a place in the team managed by the other Slav at Parkhead, Dr Jo Venglos, even if the two have an association that stretches back more than 11 years.<br><br>Dr Venglos made that clear yesterday as he conducted a rather bizarre press conference in which he answered his own questions as manager, and interpreted both questions and answers for the player who speaks virtually no English.<br><br>&#39;&#39;We will have to see if he will play this Saturday,&#39;&#39; said Venglos, &#39;&#39;but he knows that there is a lot of competition for places in the team. He is here because he will strengthen the squad, but I am very confident that he will be a success in Glasgow.&#39;&#39;<br><br>The head coach must know the strengths and weaknesses of his new #370,000 acquisition as well as any player he has managed, considering that it was he who gave him his first cap for Czechoslovakia 11 years ago.<br><br>&#39;&#39;He has played on the right side of midfield and on the left, has vast experience internationally and I am sure he will work well with the top players at this club.&#39;&#39; said the team leader.<br><br>Moravcik left German club Duisburg because he had a row with the coach who refused to play him in the position he wanted, but he expressed his delight at coming to a team that &#39;&#39;everyone in Europe knows of . . . the first British club to win the European Cup . . .&#39;&#39;<br><br>His track record of 74 caps for Czechoslovakia/Slovakia and a career with clubs like St Etienne and Bastia point to a class act, but at 33, the question Celtic fans will want answered is: Does he retain that ability?<br><br>Venglos has no doubts. &#39;&#39;It is not age that matters, but quality and performance on the field. We shall see that when he plays for Celtic. I believe in his qualities, but he will get no special favours from me because of our association.<br><br>&#39;&#39;Like other players who come here with little English he will learn quickly.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Venglos refused to discuss any names of other possible new signings but did acknowledge, as did chairman Fergus McCann, that others were being sought.<br><br>&#39;&#39;I have every faith in the players we have here, but we had so many injuries that we do need to strengthen the squad.&#39;&#39;<br><br>McCann also cited Celtic&#39;s wearisome and unhelpful policy (from their own fans&#39; viewpoint as well as the media) of not talking about transfers until they are settled, even though everybody and his aunt is aware they are trying to sign Croatia Zagreb striker Marko Viduka.<br><br>He did insist that &#39;&#39;substantial&#39;&#39; funds were available for further investments, and added that the signing of Moravcik was unusually short-term (20 months) for the club, but he was a man the coach felt could prove important.<br><br>&#39;&#39;Dr Jo has also identified areas in defence and attack that need strengthened, however, and we are actively pursuing those targets and, hopefully, will be able to report success soon.<br><br>The coach has been a great influence at the club and clearly is a man with a great football knowledge.<br><br>Of course I am a supporter and get frustrated like the rest of our fans when things don&#39;t go as well as I want, but we are very pleased with Dr Jozef. I am sure he will prove a big asset to this club.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Asked if he had a response to some fans&#39; complaint that they have paid #14m into the club for season tickets, but have seen only #2m net spent with a quarter of the season gone, he replied: &#39;&#39; Well, I would like to think that a large majority of our fans are not so simplistic as to believe that season ticket money equals transfer money.<br><br>&#39;&#39;It doesn&#39;t work quite that way. Season ticket money at the present time doesn&#39;t even equal our wage bill. The important thing is that we are unique in this respect: we are run on a profitable line, able to generate income to invest in new players.<br><br>&#39;&#39;It may not be an overnight quick-fix policy, but none the less I think it is a good foundation and is very much respected by a lot of our competitors.<br><br>&#39;&#39;If you were taking the issue of season ticket money it is interesting to say that the average season ticket price brings in #10 per seat per game.<br><br>&#39;&#39;In return for that it is up to us to bring in the very best quality of player, million pound high salary players, a high quality stadium and I think a lot of supporters realise we are delivering that as best as we can. I think most take a balanced view of that.<br><br>&#39;&#39;We invested all of our profits last year and we&#39;ll continue that way. We have demands in all directions but there are substantial sums available for investment in players.<br><br>&#39;&#39;We have a five-year rolling plan and although I will be leaving next year it that will go on so that we can afford the best.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Meanwhile, UEFA last night confirmed they have cut FC Zurich&#39;s capacity to 17,000 for Tuesday&#39;s UEFA Cup return tie with Celtic.<br><br>Zurich&#39;s Letzigrund holds 23,500, but the the figure has been reduced by 6500 on safety grounds.<br><br>More than 15,000 tickets, 1500 of which were allocated to Celtic, have already been sold for the tie and the rest are expected to be sold before Zurich&#39;s Swiss league game against St Gallen tonight.<br><br>Coach Raimondo Ponte, however, has confirmed that mid-fielder Robert Huber, who was injured against Neuchatel Xamax last weekend, will be fit for the return. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Interview</h3><a class="external" href="http://www.celticfc.net/news/8463" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.celticfc.net/news/8463</a>   <br><br>When did you first hear that Celtic were interested in signing you?<br>It was in 1998, about the end of October, when we played against Portugal in a qualifying game, and Dr Jo came to watch the game. After the match I saw them and they said they were interested in signing me. After that, things moved very quickly and the next week I signed for Celtic.<br><br>Were you aware of how your signing was received in some quarters?<br>Not really because everything had gone very quickly. Being 33 wasn&rsquo;t a problem for me. I felt very fit and confident because now in football, that age is not too old. It depends on your personal feeling. When you feel good you train well and I never really had any bad injuries. In my head I was still young for football.<br><br>On November 21, 1998, you made your derby debut. What was it like to score those first two goals against Rangers?<br>Before this game we didn&rsquo;t expect a big result against Rangers because they were dominating in the league. I was a little bit scared about what would happen in the game because it was my first derby although I was very motivated for the game. But I was a bit scared &ndash; about the result, not about my game because you can play well but if it&rsquo;s not a good result, it wouldn&rsquo;t be good for me, but it all went well for me, I scored two goals and everything changed for me after that.<br><br>Why do you think the Celtic fans took you to their hearts so quickly?<br>I think because I&rsquo;m a straightforward, simple guy. I was taught to keep my feet on the ground and be nice to the people around you, be modest. And I don&rsquo;t think I ever changed. Maybe others would say differently but in my head I never changed. I&rsquo;m still the same guy from Nitra, a small town, small village, and this is from my education<br><br>What do you remember about the 6-2 victory over Rangers in Martin O&#39;Neill&rsquo;s first season?<br>I remember Henrik&rsquo;s goal when he chipped the ball over the Rangers goalkeeper. It was at this time when we started dominating in the Scottish league. It wasn&rsquo;t a surprise like my first game when we won 5-1, because we were playing well, we were top of the league and it was also a perfect game during my time at Celtic and I&rsquo;ll remember that game for the rest of my life.<br><br>You scored another two goals against Rangers at the end of that season, at Ibrox, and your celebrations then were a bit different from 1998. Was it because you really knew and understood what the derby match was all about by then?<br>I knew this game was one of the most famous games in the world and in the media, even in France, they&rsquo;d be talking about it. And this game (Ibrox 2001) was special for me because it was almost my last chance to confirm my quality, especially away from home at Ibrox. This time we had a very confident team and we played very well, and we showed everyone that we were a stronger team than Rangers. I didn&rsquo;t expect to play in that game and I was very surprised when Martin O&rsquo;Neill read out my name before the game. And I said to myself that it might be my last chance to play well at Ibrox and to score two goals &ndash; I was very happy. When you score once in this derby game, people might say, maybe he was lucky. If you score twice, then people can see it&rsquo;s not luck and you can see in my face that I was very happy. By then I knew that I didn&rsquo;t have much time left at Celtic so I was pleased to have a good game that day.<br><br>Who were the other team-mates who impressed you during your time at Celtic?<br>We had a really good team. Paul Lambert was a really important guy, in the dressing room and on the pitch. Neil Lennon came and he became a very important part of the team. Chris Sutton up front was great - also, John Hartson, who was a good guy and good player. Alan Thompson, who had a fantastic left foot. Jackie McNamara. Also, Tommy Boyd when I first came to Celtic who was a very important person in the club, and also my French friends &ndash; Didier Agathe and Stephane Mahe, who helped me very much &ndash; and during my time at Celtic, Stiliyan Petrov was also a really nice guy and a very good player.<br><br>What were your feelings when you played at Celtic Park for the last time?<br>I was prepared for that. I had said at the beginning of the season that it would be my last season. Unfortunately, we didn&rsquo;t win that game &ndash; it was a 1-1 draw with Rangers &ndash; but if you finish at a club where people love you, you always feel sad when you have to leave, but at the same time I was satisfied with my performances at Celtic. Now, years after leaving Celtic I realise I was a bit unlucky, because I joined when I was 33 and I should have come when I was younger and played more for Celtic, a few more seasons and some more important games. But I couldn&rsquo;t have come earlier because nobody knew me in this part of Europe. Altogether, I was very satisfied and very happy to have played for Celtic.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  <br><br></h3><br></div>
