Lennon  had monitored the player&#39;s progress at the 2010 World Cup and, impressed  by what he saw, he moved to bring Izaguirre to Scotland.<br><br>An  undisclosed fee was agreed with his club Montagua and Izaguirre signed  for the Hoops on August 18th subject to a work permit. Handed the No.3  shirt, the Tegucigalpa-born ace was handed the unenviable task of  filling Celtic&#39;s troublesome left-back berth.<br><br>The early signs  were most encouraging. Izaguirre made his debut for the Hoops with an  impressive performance in a 1-0 SPL victory at Motherwell on August  29th. This was followed by a series of displays where the player caught  the eye with some fine performances. A solid defensive full-back with a  seemingly devastating ability to get forward, the Honduran swiftly  established himself as a fans favourite. Naturally an attack-minded  player he excited and entertained in equal measure, while displaying  fine stamina and a constant willingness to work hard for the team. <br><br>While  several of Lennon&#39;s new arrivals took time to settle in Glasgow and the  SPL, Izaguirre quickly became a key man for the Celts. While the Hoops early  season form was not always convincing Izaguirre frequently impressed  and his eye-catching displays saw him linked in the Scottish media to  moves to several top English Premiership sides. As Celtic eventually hit  their stride in the title race it was no surprise to see Izaguirre frequently integral to some very pleasing performances and victories.<br><br>His  dashing runs forward became a key feature of Lennon&#39;s new look Celtic  and his exciting play won him plaudits from opponents and pundits alike.  It was no real surprise then that on May 1st Emilio won Scotland&#39;s PFA  Player of the Year award. He would also pick up the Football Writers  Award.<br><br>Although Celtic agonisingly missed out on the title, Izaguirre would add a Scottish Cup winners medal to his trophy haul as Celtic  defeater Motherwell 3-0 in the Hampden final. Injury would thwart his  ambitions of playing in the CONCACAF Gold Cup in the United States in  June, but for Celtic fans that should mean the player returns to Glasgow  fresh for the challenges of the 2011-12 campaign. <br><br>However,  disaster struck on August 7th in Celtic&#39;s 1-0 win at Aberdeen. A hard  but fair challenge from the don&#39;s Peter Pawlett ended with Izaguirre landing  on the ground awkwardly which resulted in a broken leg. He was out of  action for a minimum of 4 - 6 months. On his return he was lauded and  feted by the welcoming support like a lost son. However, he couldn&#39;t  manage a place in the side, and his form was still way off. Possibly the  biggest issue was mental, and it wasn&#39;t until the 3-0 home victory over  Rangers (one of the last games of the season) that his best form was  back. The season was much of a write-off sadly for him. <br><br>It was  though a false dawn, from then on in he never captured the great spirit  and form of his first season. At worst, he looked to be afraid in  tackles, and challenges were avoided too often and he simply wouldn&#39;t often take a  man on the outside. A shadow of his former self since the injury, and  on occasion a liability to the team. <br><br>The loss of a key goal v Spartak in  the Champions League group games in 2012 was a class example. Granted he  wasn&#39;t the only one at fault, but it was Izaguirre&#39;s man who lost him and  scored a goal that was crucial and very nearly lost Celtic a place in the KO  stages (saved by a late penalty won by Celtic). It was something that was  not happening before in Izaguirre&#39;s career and concern was high. The formerly  highly feted player was on a downer and really his form never rose too far ahead of this level again. The heady early days now felt like as if they were an aeon ago.<br><br>From there on in he was still kept on as a regular first team player, and on any runs of good form, a section of the support would praise him to the hilt. Very popular, and repeatedly supporters would convince themselves that he was retuning to his best form but he wasn&#39;t. Maybe he got stuck in a rut somewhere, and got comfortable and stopped progressing.<br><br>He was still a very fine reliable defender, and his record of silverware clearly was well earned at Celtic. He scored only a handful of goals in his time, but he will have savoured each and every one of them.<br><br>He clearly showed he appreciated the support, and a teammate once tweeted about Izaguirre whistling the Celtic Song whilst walking around in the team hotel. He really loved Celtic, and we all loved him. He never hid and you could see him work away. Even when things went against him, he never shirked, and he kept on. Part of this was due to his homely life and faith, which was clear to all. He was no &#39;<i>lad</i>&#39; but was a humble man with a gift to play football. <br><br>The major problem was the loss of his pace as time went by. He was a decent defender who was often guilty of some terrible lapses in  concentration, his vulnerability at the back post became a real  weak spot in the Celtic defence. He always gave his all, but against tougher opponents he could be a weak link. In Europe he could be targetted, and many thought he should have been pushed up into the midfield. The problem is that Celtic were struggling with full-backs, and that always gave him opportunities in defence but never then considered for a change to the midfield.<br><br>The rise of Kieran Tierney in 2015-16, meant that finally Izaguirre could take a back seat. Tierney was gathering praise from many quarters, and with the lull around the club&#39;s form as Ronnie Deila&#39;s reign floundered, changes were needed. Rumours were rife that Ronnie Deila didn&#39;t rate Izaguirre, but he still remained.<br><br>Izaguirre unintentionally was to signal a key weakness in Ronnie&#39;s decision making. Against Ajax in the UEFA Cup, Izaguirre was having a torrid time and to all it was obvious he should have been subbed off after a yellow card. Soon after he was still committing fouls and duly sent-off after a second yellow. Deila looked weak and indecisive, and Celtic conceded a late goal to draw 2-2. Neither side was anything special on the day. It showed also that Izaguirre&#39;s tenure at Celtic was now to rundown.<br><br>    It has been a journey for Izaguirre, and in personal terms it has been a great experience for him. It&#39;s so easy to be cynical about modern footballers (and justifiably in many cases) but in Izaguirre&#39;s case Celtic was clearly in his heart, and not in some cod-melodramatic sense. <br><br>At the end of the season 2015-16 when the first team finally clinched the title, Izaguirre joined his colleagues on the pitch, and you could see he was in tears. It was an emotional moment as it was clearly close to the end of his time at Celtic. It was touching and a bittersweet moment for us all. We loved him as a person and in this modern age, it is great to look back on him as part of the Celtic family. As a tribute in his final match, the Green Brigade displayed a tribute banner in his honour a rare but worthy dedication from a thankful support. <br><br>He had a stay of respite for Season 2016-17, getting the odd game and short spell when Tierney was injured or rested. He was a welcome addition to the first team, and got to play in the wonderful Celtic treble winning side that remained undefeated the whole season domestically.<br><br>He left in July 2017 for Al-Fayha in Saudi Arabia, but then admitted part of the reasons for his departures was generated due to agent wrangles.<br><br>Next thing you know, surprisingly he was to return to Celtic as cover for squad support. Few saw that coming<br><h3><br></h3><b>Second Stint (2018-19)</b><br>Izzy returned in August 2018 as Celtic seemed to be struggling to get new players in. Celtic had just completed a back-to-back treble but the defence was still a major concern. As the prodigious talent Tierney was regarded to be overplayed, cover was needed, and Izaguirre was an easy (for some cynically cheap) choice for the management to make. In truth, as much as he was welcome back as a person, it was seen partly as a backward step, but the squad needed cover.<br><br>He had a disaster of a game v Valencia in the first leg of the UEFA Cup knockout stages at Celtic Park, playing in place of Tierney. He was clearly off pace and was badly guilty of the first goal by enabling the players to play onside. It just highlighted that Izaguirre was way past his best but you couldn&rsquo;t fault effort. <br><br>As Tierney suffered from injuries through the season, Izaguirre filled in and did a fine job. Overall, he was a good stand-in but not a long-run squad member.

The  Celtic defender has fought back from a broken leg but still has one  major hurdle to overcome. &ldquo;In two weeks&rsquo; time I will have another go,&rdquo;  says the Honduran. He&rsquo;s talking about his driving test which he failed  for the third time on Thursday.   <br><br>Izaguirre can mock distress  over a minor pain because he is over the major one, a pain the  24-year-old suffered when he snapped his ankle at Pittodrie in the  club&rsquo;s second game of the season. It left last season&rsquo;s player of the  year unable to contribute to the first four months of this campaign. Yet  however grievous the incident for the player, he felt compelled to  watch television replays of it.<br><br>&ldquo;I heard a click but I didn&rsquo;t  know what it was then reached down and felt the ligaments were swollen,&rdquo;  he says. &ldquo;After the first month, I didn&rsquo;t stop going to the gym. I was  in there every single day.&rdquo;<br><br>That is how he coped ahead of his  return to the senior side on 2 January. With three starts since, the  defender says every week he is feeling &ldquo;better and better&rdquo;. A deeply  religious man, Izaguirre maintains he never felt low or isolated, even  3,000 miles from home and unable to immerse himself in his job.<br><br>&ldquo;I  actually never felt really sad, I was always focusing on getting better  and that kept me going,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And I always felt part of the team  anyway because I was there to support them. That made me feel stronger,  work harder with my rehabilitation and make sure I got back in the team.  It was very, very tough for me and my family for me to be out for so  long but I am very grateful to God for helping me get back playing  again.&rdquo;<br><br>And Scott Brown. The attributes that make the Scotland  midfielder a fit for the Celtic captaincy may sometimes escape outsiders  but Izaguirre is gushing over what Brown brings to the squad dynamic.  Sharing hour upon hour of gym-time with the fun-loving Fifer, who was  building up his fitness following ankle surgery, has the full-back  beaming from ear to ear.<br><br>&ldquo;He is crazy, crazy,&rdquo; says Izaguirre,  the phrase the only one he provides in English in the course of an  interview otherwise conducted through a Spanish interpreter. &ldquo;Scott  Brown, Kelvin Wilson, Mark Wilson, we were all in the gym together most  days and we got support from each other. Spending time in the gym with  Scott was crazy. He is very funny, but I think he is a very good  captain, he gives us all a lot of support.<br><br>&ldquo;He is always a happy  person and is one of a kind in a way. He is always first into training  and first to show the rest of the team the way. He supports everybody,  and the experience he has of playing here with Celtic and knowing other  big players helps. The leadership he shows and the charisma he has is  contagious in a way.&rdquo;<br><br>Izaguirre&rsquo;s warmth could be similarly  described. He begins and ends sit-ins with the written media by going  round each one and shaking their hands. An endearing affectation, the  player is just too damn respectful to his God and fellow human beings to  serve up any juicy titbits on his Honduran buddy Jorge Claros,  currently on trial with Rangers.<br><br>The pair were pictured shopping  in Glasgow this week, the same day that Claros was quoted as saying a  move to Rangers would set him up with Scotland, his research having told  him that the club had won more league titles and cups than any other in  Scotland. What does Izaguirre think of that claim?<br><br>&ldquo;As a player I  wish him all the best, as I do with all other players. But if we ever  get on the field against each other, we will not be friends. It is none  of my business if Jorge signs for another team, but I only speak highly  of other players, the decision will be down to the coaching staff at  Rangers. He is a very good man marker and is very good at running. But I  am at Celtic so I don&rsquo;t want to say anything about any other team.&rdquo;<br><br>Plenty  was said over the summer about Izaguirre being the target for other  teams, notably Manchester United. He signed a contract extension already  agreed with Celtic during his time on the sidelines but says of the Old  Trafford link: &ldquo;My goal is to concentrate on Celtic then we will see  what happens.&rdquo;<br><br>The player doesn&rsquo;t draw great comfort from the  fact that, with his injury occurring right at the start of the season,  he has been able to return for the title run-in and the decisive days in  cup competitions awaiting Celtic as they chase the treble. He does  admit, though, that there is a personal aim he wants realise.<br><br>&ldquo;I  was frustrated by the injury because I didn&rsquo;t want my first season at  the club to be like a &lsquo;one-off&rsquo; thing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I hope the second half  of the season will show that I still have a lot to give to the club.&rdquo;<br><br>So  integral was Izaguirre to the Celtic cause that there is little doubt  he will give them plenty; enough to see them atone for the defeat at  Inverness that allowed Rangers to clinch their third consecutive  championship.<br><br>&ldquo;The title is an objective obviously that we want  to reach,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Last season, for very little, that objective  escaped through our hands.&rdquo; His Celtic team are in the driving seat in a  manner that shouldn&rsquo;t have Izaguirre agonising. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Izaguirre, Emilio - The Celtic Wiki" height="786" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/7de47af46f30f96e2128d599e420c852/GW442H786" title="Izaguirre, Emilio - The Celtic Wiki" width="442"><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  <br></h3><br></div></div>
