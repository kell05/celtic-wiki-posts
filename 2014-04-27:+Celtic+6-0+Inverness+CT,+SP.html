Second for him of late. <br></li><li>Game rescheduled to be played on a Sunday at 3pm instead of Saturday.</li><li>Green Brigade unveiled a banner directed at the former Hibs striker.It read: &ldquo;A man must be a Celt on and off the field otherwise he is of no value to the club.&rdquo; (Quote is from Willie Maley).<br></li><li>Johan  Mjallby announces he is to leave Celtic assistant role at the end of  the season. We&#39;ll be sorry to see him go, a great Celtic stalwart.</li><li>Black armbands worn and one minute silence following recent passing of Sandy Jardine (Rangers) and former Barcelona  boss Tito Vilanova. Both died of cancer. RIP.<br></li><li>Former  Celtic player Davie Moyes sacked as the Manchester Utd manager after  only one season (admittedly a poor season for them). <br></li><li>Liverpool  manager Brendan Rogers, who are on the brink of their first league  title for 24 years, states his Celtic roots and how fanatical he was for  the Celts: &ldquo;I loved it when they were on TV. They had  special players. Paul McStay was a wonderful, influential player, Danny  McGrain was brilliant and they had Packie Bonner in goal. I want to see  players in my team like a Paul McStay or a Chris Waddle - great  attacking players of their generation. It&#39;s a tough job managing Celtic  although all my family would love to see me there in the future. Martin  O&#39;Neill and Lenny would have walked to be in charge there and I&#39;m no  different.&quot; <br></li><li>The Rangers/Sevco heading closer to Admin after  admitting can&#39;t accept debit/credit cards anymore for payments as  company handling it refused them due to lack of collateral/security  given.<br></li><li>Izaguirre has landed a lucrative sponsorship deal  ahead of this summer&rsquo;s World Cup - advertising bottled water in his  native Honduras in a series of adverts shot in Scotland for Aguazul  mineral water. Izaguirre is seen in the Highlands, the streets of  Glasgow and the Celtic changing room across the four short films.   </li><li> Kris Commons has been named PFA Scotland Player of the Year for  this season. The award, voted for by Scottish Premiership players, saw  three Celts nominated &ndash;Commons, Fraser Forster and Virgil van Dijk</li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Review<img align="right" alt="[Untitled]" height="437" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/kMyToMSmtpq49-F08nDX8w57207/GW328H437" title="[Untitled]" width="328"></h3>(Mick82 of KDS)  <br>Really  enjoyed today.

First half was dull till first goal went in.<br><br>Didn&#39;t  see the GB banner as arrived just at ko, but have seen the pictures and  delighted they did it. The support elsewhere for the racist tosser was  embarrassing.<br><br>Stokes played very well and Pukki had a great wee  cameo.

in a pub before the Edinburgh derby last month.<br><br>However,  that debate was for another day as the former Wolves forward and the  rest of his team mates put the hapless Highlanders to the sword once  again, John Hughes&rsquo; side having lost 5-0 in their last trip to play  Celtic.<br><br>Stokes&rsquo; first goal came after 33 minutes of mostly  domination when, from a Griffiths corner, he rose to flick his header  into the far corner.<br><br>The game opened up more after that. Celtic  defender Ambrose bravely stuck his head in front of a goal-bound drive  from Danny Williams before Dean Brill made a decent save from Stokes at  the other end.<br><br>The increasingly busy Caley keeper was called  into action again six minutes from the break, making a great save down  at his left-hand post when right-back Adam Matthews fired in a powerful  shot.<br><br>But a minute from the interval Stokes made it 2-0 with  some ease when he drove in from eight yards after Kris Commons had  missed a fine cross from the right by Griffiths.<br><br>It looked like  being a matter of how many Celtic would score, a notion strengthened  three minutes into the second-half when Brill had to tip a powerful  drive by Griffiths over the bar for yet another Hoops corner, which  Caley defended.<br><br>Stokes secured the match ball in the 53rd minute  after midfielder Stefan Johansen won a penalty when he was squeezed by  Garry Warren and Ross Draper, the Republic of Ireland striker calmly  beating Brill from 12 yards.<br><br>Less than two minutes later there  was some anger among the Celtic fans when referee Craig Charleston  awarded Caley a chance to pull a goal back from the spot when defender  Virgil van Dijk tackled Billy McKay, but Forster dived to his left to  parry Doran&rsquo;s penalty to safety.<br><br>Forster then made a good save from McKay&rsquo;s angled-drive but Celtic were relentless.<br><br>Stokes  crashed a shot off the bar before van Dijk sent a header against the  post but in the 68th minute Griffiths made no mistake when the chance  was put on a plate for him by Stokes.<br><br>Ambrose glanced in a  Commons cross for number five and Pukki drilled in number six before the  final whistle sounded to the delight of the bedraggled Caley players.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>By Richard Wilson BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br><br>Celtic could not be contained and were only limited by the accuracy of their finishing as they swept past Inverness.<br><br>Anthony Stokes struck an accomplished hat-trick, with three more goals coming from Leigh Griffiths, Efe Ambrose and Teemu Pukki.<br><br>Despite being comfortable on the ball, Inverness ended up looking beleaguered.<br><br>They  had no answer to Celtic, and Aaron Doran&#39;s second-half penalty was  saved by Fraser Forster to cap a galling occasion for the visitors.<br><br>The remaining targets for these two teams are self-imposed.<br>Play media<br><br>Celtic&#39;s  competitive instincts are being honed by the ambition to finish with  more than 100 points, while Inverness want to claim more points than  last season, with each place they climb in the table bringing higher  prize money.<br><br>There was an opportunity, too, for individuals to  thrive, with Celtic in particularly starting with a line-up that was  arguably the strongest they could select even with a full squad to  choose from.<br><br>There will be alterations over the summer as  players arrive and depart. Even so, this will be the core of the side  that attempts to reach the Champions League group stages in the summer  qualifying rounds, and there was cause for optimism.<br><br>The front  three, with Stokes and Griffiths in front of Kris Commons, were deft,  full of movement and guile, and clinical. Commons was the orchestrator  in the early stages, but then Stokes grew to prominence and the game  began to revolve around him.<br>Teemu Pukkis scores for Celtic against Inverness<br><br>Pukki&#39;s late strike wrapped up an impressive win for the Scottish Premiership champions<br><br>The opening goal - a Stokes header from Griffith&#39;s corner - came either side of three excellent Dean Brill saves.<br><br>The  Inverness goalkeeper was agile as he kept out a Commons effort from  close range, a fierce Stokes shot from distance and then Adam Matthews,  who tried to squeeze a shot inside the goalkeeper&#39;s near post.<br><br>If  Brill&#39;s involvement was indicative of the game&#39;s nature, it was telling  also that one Inverness counter attack ended with the midfielder Ross  Draper passing the ball back to his own goalkeeper.<br><br>Inverness  were capable of some neat and constructive passing exchanges, but they  ran out of purpose in the final third. Sitting so deep, they were also  vulnerable to periods of pressure, and one ended with a Griffiths cut  back that Commons could not connect with.<br><br>The ball ran to Stokes, though, and he fired it into the net.<br><br>Inverness  retained their idealism, but it was occasionally a hindrance. The  intention was to always play the ball out of defence, but Greg Tansey  was careless with one pass, which Stefan Johansen intercepted.<br>Play media<br><br>As  the Norwegian surged into the penalty area, he was tripped by Gary  Warren, and Stokes converted the penalty with aplomb for his treble.<br><br>There  was no limit to Celtic&#39;s ambition. It was briefly interrupted when the  visitors were awarded a penalty after contact between attacker Billy  McKay and defender Virgil van Dijk, even though there was no discernible  foul.<br><br>Forster dealt with the spot-kick anyway, saving from Doran.<br><br>Hitting  the woodwork twice in 10 seconds, through Stokes and Van Dijk, was a  reminder to Inverness of the challenge they faced, then Griffiths scored  with a shot across Brill.<br><br>An Ambrose header - after which he  made a point of celebrating with the departing assistant manager Johan  Mjallby - and a Pukki strike completed the scoring.<br><br>It was chastening for Inverness, but a reminder of the slick assurance Celtic are capable of.<br><br><br><br>Boss Neil Lennon delighted as Celtic hit Inverness for six<br>BBC<br>Neil Lennon reckons Celtic produced their finest display of the season to defeat Inverness 6-0.<br><br>The champions cruised to a home win against the Highlanders with Anthony Stokes hitting a hat-trick.<br><br>Leigh  Griffiths, Efe Ambrose and Teemu Pukki were also on target, and  goalkeeper Fraser Forster saved Aaron Doran&#39;s second-half penalty.<br>Efe Ambrose celebration<br><br>Celtic defender Efe Ambrose&#39;s acrobatic celebration<br><br>&quot;It was a fantastic all-round performance and probably the best of the season,&quot; said Celtic boss Lennon.<br><br>&quot;The  attitude of the players from the start was fantastic. Our quality was  brilliant and we got stronger as the game went on. All the plaudits go  to the players.<br><br>&quot;There was a flow to us and we looked really  dangerous going forward, defensively we were pretty solid, and when the  keeper was called on he made a penalty save.&quot;<br><br>Lennon revealed  news of English Premier League leaders Liverpool&#39;s home defeat by  Chelsea filtered through to his players at half-time.<br><br>And he said that helped him highlight just how well his side have done this season.<br><br>&quot;When  we got the Liverpool score in we said to them, &#39;You know titles are not  given to you, and you&#39;ve gone and won yours, and it&#39;s never easy to do  something like that,&quot; explained Lennon.<br><br>&quot;You need to enjoy the moment and enjoy your career here and don&#39;t take it for granted.<br><br>&quot;And  they went out in the second half and again the attitude was spot on and  they went right to the last minute. We never really gave Inverness an  in at all.&quot;<br><br>Lennon praised hat-trick hero Stokes, and also joked about his concerns over Ambrose&#39;s acrobatic goal celebration.<br>Play media<br><br>&quot;Anthony  Stokes is playing really well, he&#39;s been bang on form for the last four  or five months of the season,&quot; added the Celtic boss.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s up  to 19 goals now and if he gets 20 that&#39;ll be his third or fourth  successive season getting 20, so he&#39;s been a very important player for  us.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m just picturing him [Efe Ambrose] landing on his neck  one day and us having to scrape him off the floor. You can see the joy  he gets out of his football and scoring goals is always special for  him.&quot;  <br><br>  <br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 6, Inverness CT 0.<br>90:00 +1:13 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 6, Inverness CT 0.<br>89:59<br><br>Corner, Celtic.
