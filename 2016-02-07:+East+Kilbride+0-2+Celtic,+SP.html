of staging the game.<br>RELATED ARTICLES<br><br><br>Share this article<br>Share<br><br>After a day of speculation on where the game could be played, the SFA last night issued a statement saying: &lsquo;Following discussions with East Kilbride FC, the Scottish FA board have approved the Excelsior Stadium as the host venue for the William Hill Scottish Cup fifth-round match between East Kilbride and Celtic on Sunday, February 7.&rsquo;<br><br>East Kilbride chairman Mark Horner welcomed the move, saying: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve been in talks with various stadiums all day and put forward the Excelsior as the best, nearest and most suitable stadium to host the game and we are delighted the SFA have agreed.<br><br>&lsquo;The stadium is modern, a great size and the surface is similar to K-Park, which the manager and players are delighted about.<br><br>East Kilbride&#39;s Sean Winter (left) enjoys himself after scoring his side&#39;s second goal of the game <br>+3<br><br>East Kilbride&#39;s Sean Winter (left) enjoys himself after scoring his side&#39;s second goal of the game <br><br>&lsquo;The stadium also has great disabled access, which is another plus point as we are planning to take hundreds of children from East Kilbride with ASN (additional support needs) to the game.<br><br>&lsquo;We are all really looking forward to what will be a great occasion for the club and the town.&rsquo;<br><br>Meanwhile, Croatian trialist Ljuban Crepulja has thanked compatriot Jozo Simunovic for helping him through his time at Celtic &mdash;

He greeted me, made sure I met with everyone and we hung out every day. I owe him a really big thank you.<br><br>&lsquo;Being there was another world. For me, it was a fantastic experience to be part of Celtic, even if for five days.<br><br>&lsquo;They have so many big-name players who I know from watching television or the English Premier League.<br><br>&lsquo;It was not easy to walk into the changing room but fortunately Jozo was with me. I soon realised these players were just normal people and I quickly relaxed.
