The hosts deservedly drew level in the 55th minute when Claudio Caniggia crossed towards Sara in the box, only forCelticskipper Tom Boyd to head into his own net.Despite uncertainty at the back,Celticheld firm and were rewarded when a corner deflected across the area for Agathe to head the winner from close range.<br>  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">  <tbody><tr>   <td>   <br>   Evening Times (Glasgow)<br><br>   December11, 2000<br><br>   <b>&rsquo;</b><b>IT&#39;S THE LUCK OF THE IRISH&rsquo; PREMIER ANALYSIS: O&#39;Neill&#39;s   battling Bhoys finally get the nod in Dens thriller to keep their big title   challenge in the fast lane</b><br>   <br>   BYLINE:By Thomas Jordan<br>   <br>   <br>   MARTIN O&#39;NEILL has brought something toCelticthat all the money in the world   couldn&#39;t buy.<br><br>The Irishman could land all the top players   from around Europe by shelling out millions in transfer fees and the huge   salaries they command - but it&#39;s impossible to put a price on good luck.That is what thePremier Leagueleaders are carrying at the moment, as was proved in   their last-gasp 2-1 win overDundeeat Dens Park.At best, O&#39;Neill and his side should have   been heading back down to Glasgow with only a point in the bag after being   outplayed by Ivano Bonetti&#39;s team for most of the match.<br>   <br>   In the past, that is all they would have had to show for   their efforts. However, things are different this season under O&#39;Neill, and,   as Didier Agathe&#39;s last-minute winner showed,Celticare going to be extremely difficult   to move off top spot.<br><br>In fact, it&#39;s victories like last night&#39;s   that win championships and it seemsCelticare destined to finish in pole position.True, it&#39;s still a little too early to call   it quits because, as we all know, things can change very quickly in this   business.Look at it this way. HadCelticdrawn withDundee,and Rangers won their two matches in hand, all of a   sudden Dick Advocaat&#39;s men would have been right back in contention.<br><br>So, if Tom Boyd walks up to collect the   league trophy in May, then he can look back to their smash-and-grab job at   Dens as one of the most important results of the season.None of the Parkhead players will come out   just yet and say they will win the league, but you can tell how vital this   result was for them.Like everyone else, they know they didn&#39;t   deserve to win, but this team doesn&#39;t know when they are beaten.<br><br>O&#39;Neill was clearly relieved and thrilled   with the result and the fact his men didn&#39;t let their heads go down when   things didn&#39;t go their way.He said: &quot;I&#39;m just delighted with the   win. To pick up the three points is the most important thing for us at the   moment.<br><br>&quot;I thought it was a fantastic game andDundeecan consider themselves very unfortunate not to get something   out of the match.<br><br>&quot;We started well by scoring after just   four minutes when Stilian Petrov put us ahead and we also had a good chance   to double our lead when Lubo Moravcik went through on the goalkeeper but   overran the ball.<br><br>&quot;Perhaps that was the turning point   because if we had got a<br>second goal, then it may have been a   different game.<br><br>&quot;But they were well in the match at   that stage and I thought they thoroughly deserved their equaliser and I was   impressed withDundee.<br><br>&quot;The last half-hour could have gone   either way with both sides going for the win.<br><br>&quot;We kept going for the win right up   until the last minute and luckily we got the goal.&quot;<br><br>All eyes were on &pound;5.75m midfielder Neil   Lennon to see how he would perform in his first SPL outing after starring in   the Premiership with Leicester.<br>And he immediately won himself a huge roar   from the visiting support when he put in a brilliant sliding tackle onDundeeforward Juan Sara to win back possession.<br>Lennon will be the first to hold his hands   up and say that he can play a lot better, but he showed his quality at times   and will be a key player for his new club in the coming months.<br><br>It looked as though his arrival had boosted   his team-mates as they stormed into an early lead. Bobby Petta found Moravcik   inside the penalty box and Petrov finished off his cut-back in style,   side-footing a shot high into the net.<br><br>However, they couldn&#39;t build on that and   graduallyDundeecrept into the game and were unfortunate to go in at   half-time a goal behind.<br><br>Bonetti&#39;s team didn&#39;t have long to wait   after the interval before they were back on level terms. Claudio Caniggia got   free on the left and whipped in a dangerous cross for Sara, only for Boyd to   head the ball past keeper Robert Douglas and into his own net.<br><br>After that, it was a case of hanging on forCeltic,until O&#39;Neill changed his formation. He deserves credit   for that, because it certainly brought his side back into contention.The back three were being pulled all over   the place byDundee&#39;sfront pairing of Caniggia and Sara before the Irishman   swapped Petta with Jackie McNamara with 25<br>minutes remaining.<br><br>O&#39;Neill changed to a 4-4-2 formation, and   that led to an immediate improvement.It paid dividends whenCelticstole the points in the last minute after a Petrov<br>corner caused problems in theDundeesix-yard box. Chris Coyne&#39;s attempted clearance   rebounded off Steven Tweed straight to the unmarked Agathe, and he knocked   the ball into the net from just a yard out.<br><br>It was a cruel lesson for Bonetti&#39;s team,   and he said: &quot;When you lose a goal in the last seconds, and do it twice   in seven days, something tells me that&#39;s not possible.<br><br>&quot;I think we are playing very well and I   am happy with the way they performed and for the fans to see them play like that.<br><br>&quot;It was a wonderful match, but I am   still disappointed not to get the points when we had the chance to win again,   so I am very unhappy in that way.   </td>  </tr> </tbody></table>    <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">  <tbody><tr>   <td>   <br>   The Herald (Glasgow)<br><br>   December11, 2000<br><b><br>   </b><b>Celtic</b><b>grab   late goal in Dens Park escape act</b><br>   <br>   BYLINE:Ken Gallacher<br>   <br>   DUNDEE...1CELTIC...2<br>Celticclung to their lead at the top of thePremierLeaguelast night when Didier Agathe snatched a goal in injury   time to rescue the Parkhead team as victory had seemed to move beyond their   grasp.They had taken the lead in four minutes   through Stilian Petrov and had then hung on for the rest of the first half as   a Claudio Caniggia-inspiredDundeeplaced them under enormous pressure as they looked for   the equaliser.<br><br>They got that 10 minutes after half-time   when a Caniggia cross was headed past his own keeper by Tom Boyd. However,Celtic, refusing to buckle   even under the menace of Caniggia and the other Latin imports who have   transformed this Dens Park team, found it within themselves to fight back and   get the winner.<br>   <br>   They were attacking in the last quarter of an hour,   looking more dangerous than they had since they scored.Dundeesurvived penalty appeals when Giorgio   Nemsadze handled as he cleared in his own penalty box and then Tom Boyd and   Alan Thompson were both yellow-carded asCeltic&#39;sefforts became increasingly frantic.<br><br>Then, just after the announcement that there   was a minute to be added,Celticforced a corner on the left. Petrov swung it into goal   where Johan Mjallby won it. For a moment, the ball bounced on theDundeesix-yard line as keeper Marco Roccati failed to collect   it. The ball then broke towards the far post and Agathe was there to force it   over the line.<br><br>Celtic, though, had often   been outplayed by the swiftDundeeside who must feel aggrieved that they were not able to   take even a point from such a performance.It was not a nightCelticwill want to dwell on - the late, late goal from Agathe   apart. New boy Neil Lennon celebrated along with the support but there must   have been a great deal of relief in his mind. He found the pace of the game a   little frantic at times but his passing was accurate and precise and he will   do better once he settles.<br><br>Any notions of holdingCelticand hitting them on the counter- attack thatDundeemay have held before this game were destroyed within the   first four minutes.<br><br>The opening goal it came within a simple and   direct move, Didier Agathe beginning it with powerful running on the right   and a cross into goal where the ball was moved on to the left flank. Lubo-mir   Moravcik was there and he clipped the ball back for the incoming Petrov to   drive a shot beyond Marco Roccati and into goal.<br><br>Dundeewere now forced on to the attack, a role they relished   as the first half unfolded and thePremierLeagueleaders began to realise that, despite their early   strike, they had serious challenge on their hands from the Dens Park men,   though the home team did lose Marco de Marchi after just five minutes with   what appeared to be a hamstring injury. Chris Coyne came on but the change   did not seem to upset home team at all.<br><br>That was mainly becauseCelticwere being pushed back into their own half as Caniggia   and his fellow attackers piled on the pressure.Dundeewere carrying the game to the Parkhead side and the   Argentinian went clear and placed a superb pass to Bento Carranza. He moved   the ball in to Juan Sara whose shot was blocked.<br><br>Dundeethen forced a string of corners without being able to   make any on them count, but they deserved an equaliser in 30 minutes when a   through-ball from Marcello Marrocco again found Caniggia. This time the   striker raced away from his defensive markers, drew Robert Douglas from his   line, and then clipped the ball for goal. Joos Valgaeren just made it back to   clear the ball just short of the goal line.<br><br>Before half-time, Douglas had to move   swiftly to hold a headed clearance rom Mjallby and Sara headed over the bar   before Alan Thompson relieved the pressure with a break and shot which   Roccati beat down and cleared.<br><br>Tommy Johnson replaced Moravcik at the start   of the second half, but the flow of the game remained unchanged and in the   fifty-fifth minute Caniggia, who had tormented theCelticdefenders throughout, was sent clear on the left.<br><br>He whipped in a cross and Tom Boyd, trying   to clear from the lurking Sara, only succeeded in scoring a spectacular own   goal with a diving header which left poor Douglas unable to reach the ball.<br><br>Five minutes later Caniggia was off again   with theCelticdefenders helpless against his close control. He left   them all in his wake and struck an angled shot into the side net.<br><br>In 65 minutes Jackie McNamara replaced Bobby   Petta and then Shaun McSkimming took over from Javier Artero forDundee.<br><br>Following that came the lethal finish from   Agathe andCeltictravelled back to Glasgow with their lead unscathed.   </td>  </tr> </tbody></table>  </div><br></div>
