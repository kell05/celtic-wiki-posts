Stevie Gerrard was well remembered for  a slip v Chelsea in 2014 that allowed Chelsea to score &amp; win and go  on to win their league, Brendan Rodgers was the Liverpool manager. Some  say they both didn&#39;t get on, but not clear. The dynamic was to be  tested, but as a psychological test there was only going to be one  winner.    </div><div><br>The season started ridiculously  early, with ironically Boyata being a talking point, and highlighted a  lack of foresight in sorting this out. Boyata&#39;s name was to feature  prominently as Celtic&#39;s transfer window created chaos. Despite all the  good notes on Rodgers, this time his team with the board had made a  mess. They struggled to get any defenders in, then held onto Boyata who  went into a major diva fit and practically on strike. Celtic in this  environment ended up knocked up prematurely from the Champions League  qualifiers v AEK Athens. <br><br>Next thing, Celtic lost Dembele who was  desperate to leave (albeit for &pound;20m) but Boyata was retained (or  couldn&#39;t be shifted out). Little good was brought in terms of permanent  playing staff, with two loans. No replacement for the Dembele, Armstrong  etc. Celtic were still stuck with the hapless Compper, whilst Hendry in  defence was a major cause for concern. Question marks on Rodgers  transfer record were gaining ground.<br><br>The domestic season started  briskly, but a defeat to Hearts showed the team needed freshening up and  appeared to be mentally drained. Celtic were to start poorly with the  First Team&#39;s worst start in 20 years with Hearts surprisingly on top of  the league. Supporters started to bring out the pitchforks with some  waving banners about Celts for Change revivals and shouts for the  removal of Peter Lawell (Chief Exec of Celtic). In time it was clear the  board were not the real problem.<br><br>The big question that was  arising was if Brendan Rodgers was leaving at the end of the season.  Some quotes were being taken to reflect his frustrations and his body  language was being interpreted that he was losing his spark for the  role. The number of loans on the books and the inability to move off  nonperforming players fuelled this theory, but was he really working his  ticket out? Rodgers was being criticised for his decision making and  possibly his enthusiasm in the role now, concerns were arising.<br><br>An  easier than it sounds 1-0 hammering of Sevco put all back on side with  Rodgers, and it calmed the nerves, and Hearts were to fall away.  However, performances were unconvincing but Celtic were able to keep  their noses in front and stay there. <br><br>Celtic under won the League  Cup at a cantor to be honest, which was a fabulous triumph and now  Brendan Rodgers had managed Celtic to an incredible seven trophies in a  row, the treble treble was still on. <br><br>December 2018 was a packed  out month and Celtic performed well, albeit only scraping through the  Europa League Group stage by the skin of their teeth. A major victory  that showed the steel of the team was a back to the wall 4-3 victory  over Aberdeen, possibly the most exciting game of the season.<br><br>The  crunch game was v Sevco at the end of the month in the traditional  match which if won would have clearly have closed the door on Sevco&rsquo;s  title challenge. However, Celtic lost 1-0 in what was a very one-sided  match to Sevco and the title race was back on, with both sides level on  points but Celtic had a game in hand. Things were not looking good, and  Brendan Rodgers was getting flak, although fatigue for the players was a  valid excuse, but Rodgers tactics could be too predictable and the  defence and midfield were ill equipped to handle the situation.<br><br>The  issues over the transfer window in the summer were repeatedly raised,  and all agreed that it was not good. Brendan Rodgers was clearly showing  frustrations and admitting it hadn&rsquo;t gone to plan, but he deserves flak  too as he purchased various figures instead of concentrating on areas  like defence. The squad was bloated, and fringe players (such as Compper  and Gamboa) were wasting time at the club.<br><br>January had to be a  reboot, and the introduction of big name loan signings was a surprise.  Weah &amp; Burke were stars from the off but this fizzled out later on. Ex-Celt Charlie Nicholas  though stated the believed that Sevco were now the favourites for the  title, which at this point was ridiculous. They had strengthened but  with older players. Brendan Rodgers just shrugged it off, and got on  with things.<br><br>Into the New Year, things started to go right for  Celtic again: long sequence of clean sheets, victories and Sevco  dropping points enabled Celtic build up a comfortable 8pts advantage in  the league as well as progress in the Scottish Cup. More important was  the great form of players who were really making a great fist of things,  such as new players like Burke and Weah. Scott Brown surprised all by  having a purple patch of quality goals, and some late winners by Celtic  helped to build confidence in the side.<br><br>Injuries were a bane,  with Rogic &amp; Benkovic out for a long time and Tierney out for a run  of games, but the squad had just about coped despite being stretched  thin. The best was the surprise form of youngster Ewan Henderson, the  young starlet playing ahead of his years, another great asset to the  youth set-up at Celtic.<br><br>Most important game and pivotal was  probably the 1-0 victory v Kilmarnock away in the league. In Feb 2019,  Kilmarnock were punching way above their weight this season with some  excellent performances and pushing for top slots in the league. Celtic  had lost twice away there in 2017, and Celtic struggled on their plastic  pitch in this match with a late goal (89th min) by Scott Brown sealing  the points in a hard fought albeit fortunate win (goal was deflected). <br><br>   Celtic seemed to be on course for the league title, and then the big  shock happened&hellip;Brendan Rodgers had left the building, taking some major  backroom staff with him.</div><div><b><br>Premature Departure from Celtic (Feb 2019)<br></b></div><div>In  Feb 2019, Brendan Rodgers surprised many by suddenly announcing that he  was given permission to discuss with Leicester City for their vacant  manager&#39;s role, and he was gone fast to Leicester City with a number of  key background staff. The timing was disappointing as Celtic had 11  league games to go with the title still to be won and the Scottish Cup  too. There had been rumours and discussions over the season that Rodgers  was looking to possibly move on in the summer, especially as there had  been so many loans over the past two windows and his body language was  much different than before.<br><br>For many it seemed unprofessional,  and understandably the support did not take it well. With the history  making treble-treble potentially on the way, it was poor for the players  and the club, and many felt deflated. It seemed as if the Liverpool  fans complaints on their prior manager were correct. Different reports  said differently if it was the Leicester&#39;s owners or Brendan Rodgers who  was responsible for the premature departure. He could have waited till  the end of the season, the loss of the backroom staff was also poor.<br><br>With  the money on offer you could understand, but he was well paid at  Celtic, and the opportunities were far greater at Celtic, He still had  much to prove in Europe with Celtic (or anyone else), and really there  was more to offer at Celtic for prestige. <br><br>Some wits remarked,  that it was disappointing that Brendan Rogers had left the club with the  reputation of being the only treble winning manager in Celtic&#39;s history  not to get to a European final. </div><br><img align="right" alt="Rodgers, Brendan - The Celtic Wiki" height="209" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/e2ef01f4c9f6b6c87fe6251a858e4023/GW367H209" title="Rodgers, Brendan - The Celtic Wiki" width="367">The  support online and across the board were vitriolic (some dubbed him as  &#39;The Rat&#39;) and taking it as being double-standards after the past furore  over Dembele (who tweeted an &quot;<i>I told you so</i>&quot; tweet following  Rodgers&#39; move). Stories starting flying around of that Brendan Rodgers&#39;  tales of his support &amp; history with Celtic were apocryphal, but that  can best be left for others to decipher. <br><br>The Green Brigade fans made their views known with a vitriolic banner, with the line: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;You traded immortality for mediocrity. Never a Celt. Always a Fraud&quot;.</i><br></blockquote><br>BBC Journalist Tom English probably had it right (although not in all cases) when he wrote on the departure that: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;Sentiment nearly always gets trumped by ambition in football&quot;. </i><br></blockquote><br>In  fairness to Rodgers, maybe the decision was forced by his new club (as  he later stated) and possibly there were issues with the Celtic board.  It would take time for the full facts to come forward, but in general  there were many in football critical of Rodgers&#39; premature move  including surprisingly former Celtic bete noir Mourinho.<br><br>Neil Lennon took over from Brendan Rogers as interim manager for the remainder of the 2018/19 season.<br><br><div><b>Neil Lennon&#39;s Tenure<img align="right" alt="Neil Lennon" height="274" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/8d6d566a19e36909bcbe62e632549b9a/GW274H274" title="Neil Lennon" width="274"></b></div><div>Following the unexpected and sudden departure of Brendan Rodgers to  Leicester in Feb 2019, Neil Lennon was back in at Celtic at the helm in  an interim role. He had only recently left Hibs under a cloud, but many  sympathised with him. However, he was back at Celtic with the club 8pts  in front of Sevco in the race for the league title and a Scottish Cup  still to be won too, to complete a possible third treble in a row.<br><br>Celtic had the advantage with their nose in front, but that could be easily lost.<br><br>   Under Lennon, Celtic carried on from where they left off with Rodgers.  His first match in charge was ironically against the two Edinburgh  sides, but Celtic came through in both matches. Against Hearts it was a  late injury time winner which rubbed it in for Hearts.<br><br>Celtic  continued to win matches, albeit there was some concern as the margins  were narrow, and it was worried that Lennon was favouring players, but  whilst the first team was winning and stretching their league lead,  there were few complaints.<br> <br> The thing is that in the league,  Lennon had to hardly lift a finger as Sevco were imploding. Having been  level at the end of December in the league, Sevco had since then dropped  many points and were to be 10pts behind in the run up to the third  meeting of the season. The match was to be at Celtic Park, and as much  as this was built as the title decider, for most the title race  regardless of the result was already sealed. Celtic won the match v  Sevco 2-1 at Celtic Park, which effectively sealed the title (if not yet  fully), and there was relief and celebrations. Celtic mostly dominated  although did let Sevco back into the match, and in some ways reflected  the season as a whole, but there was no denying that Celtic were the  better team overall in the match.<br><br>There was no denying it was hurting Sevco, with Ally McCoist referring to Celtic Park in a TalkRadio interview Show saying: <br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;When  I&rsquo;m on that new stretch of motorway that takes you the other side of  Glasgow, I look the other way. If Celtic Park is on my left, I can&rsquo;t  even look at it. I look to the right hand side!&rdquo;  </i><br></blockquote><br>The  cherry on the cake was Sevco&#39;s defeat to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup  who had also knocked them out of the league cup as well, and was the  first time they had defeated Sevco in all the major competitions in one  season. For Celtic it was a filip that ended another of Sevco&#39;s chances  of a first top tier trophy.<br> <br>It just all helped Lennon, his  biggest fear was to see the advantage handed to him being lost and he  would have to take all the flak undeservedly.<br><br>The result was a  fine set of results over the course of his time as the interim manager,  leading the First Team on to complete the domestic Treble-Treble - a  truly historic achievement.<br><br>As for performances, it was a mixed  bag, but there were a number of players who were not performing to the  best of their ability due to mental exhaustion, injury or tiredness. The  performances were in decline over his time, as the original impetus  seemed to dip. The loss of key players over long stretches wasn&#39;t  helping (e.g. Tierney, Christie, Griffiths, Boyata, Rogic etc) but maybe  it was tactics &amp; formations too.<br><br>The fact is though that  despite the positive results and hard work done by Lennon, some were  convinced he was the man for the long-run, and the defeat to Sevco at  Ibrox was seen as the result that likely killed off Lennon&#39;s chances for  the permanent role. It was a very poor performance and some criticised  various team selections on the day.<br><br>However, the board had faith  in him and offered him the job straight after the Scottish Cup final,  which he accepted. Admittedly the response was mixed. Some fans felt he  had passed the interim term test, others felt it was backward move, and  there was frustration that despite various names having been thrown  about in the media, that no other major prospects were seriously  approached &amp; interviewed for the role. </div><img align="bottom" alt="2019-05-25: Celtic 2-1 Hearts, Scottish Cup - Pic" height="465" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c138b6574e1f29f3becd9c6186529477/GW465H465" title="2019-05-25: Celtic 2-1 Hearts, Scottish Cup - Pic" width="465"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Season Review 2018-19 - The Celtic Wiki" height="874" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/bf8524f3a2725eb33503cf789e84be41/GW573H874" title="Season Review 2018-19 - The Celtic Wiki" width="573"><br><img align="bottom" alt="Season Review 2018-19 - The Celtic Wiki" height="442" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/1b46c7474bd0f1f41b6fcc8b1575403d/GW787H442" title="Season Review 2018-19 - The Celtic Wiki" width="787"><br></div></div>
