You timidly stood  back and let your club be   pillaged, when fans of any other team would  have rioted. You were too   busy staring down the chapel over the road  to see the huge removal van   pull up behind your back. You thought not  for what you could do for your   team, but what your team should do for  you. <br><br>Craig Whyte - Had I   been given a list of 1000 potential  buyers of Rangers and asked to   choose my preference, I could not have  picked better. <br><br>Laptop   Loyal - Where were your questions? You  blindly accepted claims of   Ronaldo, a team for every competition,  tenners, &pound;700m super-stadiums and   billionaire owners, and everyone  over here laughed. Really loud. You   had it in your power to rally the  troops, but instead gorged on free   tickets, back-rubs, and a wee shot  on the trophy room bike.<br><br>Finally - David Murray - You killed Rangers. Celtic Legend.<br><br>To    each of you: many, many thanks, from the bottom of all of our hearts,    we could never have enjoyed any of this without your help.<br><br>As    this comes to a close, and Their fans reach for the bookmark button in    case of the million-to-one chance this turns out to be a highly    embarrasing &quot;spiky golf shoes&quot; moment, I&#39;d like to raise a toast to    those who can&#39;t be with us. So here&#39;s to our absent friends, with whom    we&#39;d love to have shared this year&#39;s relentless hilarity.<br><br>So, by    the admin rights temporarily vested in me, I hereby declare thee the   The  Final Generic hun (1873) Ltd Thread. May all who post in her be   blessed  with good health, sore cheeks from laughing, and copious   amounts of  jelly and ice-cream.<br><br>Party-on dudes. 						 						 						<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Administration (2012) - The Celtic Wiki" height="1024" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/81b242df8b9eab1b958da15009d584bf/GW576H1024" title="Rangers - Administration (2012) - The Celtic Wiki" width="576"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  KDS Threads</h3><ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8645806/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Feb 2012 (1)</a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8647372/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Feb 2012 (2)</a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8671347/4/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apr 2012 (3)</a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8691149/1/?x=50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2012 (4)</a></li></ul><h3>Liquidation threads</h3><ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8700235/144/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">June 2012 (1)</a><br></li><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8648238/30/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">June 2012 (2)</a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8700235/521/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">July 2012 (1)</a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8648238/30/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">July 2012 (2)</a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Rangers intend to go into administration</h3>Herald<br>Monday 13 February 2012<br><br>Rangers have lodged an intention to go into administration with the Court of Session.<br><br>The   Ibrox club lodged the notice in Edinburgh at Monday lunchtime. They  now  have five days in which to formally declare administrators have  taken  over the running of the club.<br><br>Solicitors lodged the papers with the Court of Session on behalf of the club&#39;s directors on Monday.<br><br>Rangers   are currently awaiting the result of a �49m tax case with HM Revenue   and Customs in relation to the club&#39;s use of the Employee Benefits Trust   to pay players and staff.<br><br>The Court of Session said papers confirming the intention to appoint administrators had been received.<br>  <br>   Tom English, April 2011 <br><br>Whyte   has deposited &pound;28m as proof of his financial clout. He has spent a   large six-figure sum on lawyers and accountants and due diligence   stretching back six months. He has said publicly, more than once, that   he is committed to investing &pound;25m over five years on new players. He has   stayed in the game and has worked out a &quot;mechanism&quot; to deal with   whatever HMRC may through at the club. He has stayed in the deal, also,   despite the nasty little surprise of a &pound;2.8m unpaid tax bill was   discovered. He has hung around and inched things forward despite all of   that and regardless of the two UEFA charges of sectarian chanting that   are hanging over the club at present.<br><br>Unless he&#39;s a complete   madman - spending millions on getting rid of Lloyds and Murray and then   not bothering to invest in the business he has just bought - then we   must assume that he is going to do what he says. He has hung his   reputation on delivering what he has said. What is Johnston thinking?   That Whyte will take control of the club and then go, &quot;HaHa! Fooled ye   all! I don&#39;t have another bob to my name! We&#39;re all going down in   flames!&quot;<br><br>At the very least, he deserves a bit more respect than   he got from Johnston yesterday. It was hard to know what infuriated   Whyte the most when he read what Johnston had to say; the chairman&#39;s   rather one-eyed appraisal of things or the final paragraph of his   statement which painted Whyte as an understanding soul whose reaction to   the bombshell of being told about a rival bidder was all very amicable   and constructive.

By the time  he  left school he had more than &pound;20,000 in his bank account.<br>Today,   aged just 39, this financial whizzkid from Motherwell stands on the   brink of pulling off the biggest deal of his life - and finally bringing   the curtain down on one of the longest-running sagas in Scottish   football.<br>Record Sport understands self-made billionaire Whyte has   entered into the final stages of negotiations to buy control of the club   he loves from Sir David Murray.<br>And he&#39;s still one year younger than captain Davie Weir.<br>A   deal worth around &pound;30million is now believed to have reached such an   advanced stage that sources say Whyte, a high-roller who splits his time   between a home in London and the idyllic Castle Grant in   Grantown-on-Spey, could even have the keys to Ibrox in time to fund a   major refurbishment of Walter Smith&#39;s top-team squad in January.<br>The   news will delight Rangers supporters who have been fretting over the   future of their club ever since Murray first slapped a For Sale sign on   the front door of Edmiston Drive around three years ago.<br>As the   club&#39;s financial health deteriorated to such an extent the banks moved   in to control the purse strings, a series of false dawns came and went.<br>First,   a consortium headed up by South African-based tycoon Dave King came to   the fore only to fail to meet Murray&#39;s asking price.<br>Then, in March   this year, Londonbased property developer Andrew Ellis emerged as the   frontrunner and was granted a period of exclusivity in order to get the   deal done.<br>But Ellis, now part of the consortium, did not have the   financial clout to back up his bold promises and his bid collapsed,   leaving Rangers firmly in the grip of the Lloyds Group.<br>Exiled   Glaswegian King was then talked up once more as the possible saviour but   he was also engaged in a long-running battle with the tax man and  while  those issues remained unresolved, he too looked l ike an  increasingly  unlikely white knight for a club now engulfed by crisis.<br>But   yesterday, quite out of the blue, Record Sport learned a new man is at   the table and that a deal to end Murray&#39;s 22-year reign is ready to be   completed.<br>And that man is a relative boy.<br>By the age of 26,  Whyte  was already Scot land&#39;s youngest self-made millionaire. Now, 13  years  on, and in charge of a vast business empire, his wealth is off  the  radar.<br>Whyte is a venture capitalist who has made his millions  from  playing the markets - a skill he secret ly began honing in his  third  year at Glasgow&#39;s Kelvinside Academy. In one of his few  interviews he  revealed how he immediately regretted going to the  private school -  because he despised playing rugby.<br>He said: &quot;I  hated the discipline  of it. It was a rugby-only school, which I didn&#39;t  play as I was  interested in football.&#39;&#39; Whyte worked weekends for his  dad&#39;s plant hire  firm. And he saved up his wages to fund his habit of  gambling on Stock  Exchange.<br>It is said that, by the time he left school, he had more cash in his bank than many of his teachers.<br>At 19, he was in charge of his own hire plant.<br>Now   he owns his own castle - one of the most historic buildings in   Scotland. And very soon he could be adding Rangers to his portfolio. It   remains to be seen if Whyte&#39;s move to capture the club will f lush any   other parties out of the woodwork because - despite their failure to   strike a deal with Murray - King and his consortium have yet to throw in   the towel on their own ambitions.<br>They had put together a package   worth around &pound;18m but this was flatly rejected and Ellis drove the price   up when he agreed to pay Murray more than &pound;30m.<br>The club&#39;s debt has been reduced by around &pound;10m since then but the selling price remains the same.<br>Now,   quite clearly, Whyte believes he will be able to close the deal and  the  young gun must have said enough to impress Murray, who has stated  all  along that he will only sell the club to the right people - men  with  enough money to take the club forward.<br>Who knows? Murray may even regard Whyte as something of a kindred spirit.<br>After all, Murray was himself aged just 37 back in 1988 when he launched a takeover of the Ibrox club.<br>It   was the beginning of one of the most successful periods in Rangers&#39;   history but Murray&#39;s aggressive pursuit of European glory eventually saw   him writing the kind of cheques that his club could simply not afford.<br>Now   Whyte is bringing his money to the table but it remains to be seen if   he will adopt the same scatter-cash approach as the man who has owned   the club for the past two decades.<br>But if he brings in even half of the number of trophies Murray delivered then the fans are unlikely to be complaining<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Rangers owner Craig Whyte admits he sold four years&#39; worth of season tickets to keep Ibrox club running</h3><br>Jan 31 2012 Exclusive by James Traynor &amp; Keith Jackson<br><br><br>CRAIG WHYTE sold off four years of fans&#39; money to help fund his Rangers buy-out, it was revealed last night.<br><br>And   Record Sport can also reveal high-ranking HMRC officials are   investigating alleged non-payment of VAT since Whyte gained control of   the club last May.<br><br>Current director Dave King and former board   member Paul Murray have been quizzed by the tax authorities as part of   their enquiry which has revealed &pound;24.4million has been borrowed against   future season-tickets sales.<br><br>Tranches of tickets over four   seasons have been sold to Ticketus, a London-based group linked to   Octopus, and it&#39;s claimed this deal helped finance Whyte&#39;s operating   costs after the takeover.<br><br>Whyte himself last night confirmed he   had sold off the tickets but denied he used the money to pay off Lloyds   Bank. He insisted the &pound;18m for the bank came from one of his companies.<br><br>When   Whyte took over Rangers&#39; debt was &pound;18m to Lloyds Bank and their wage   bill had been reduced to &pound;14m but it is believed the club could owe much   more than that.<br><br>It&#39;s thought the current debt is &pound;21m to   Ticketus plus &pound;5m VAT on the ticket deal. But there could be other bills   due and of course Rangers are awaiting the final verdict on their &pound;49m   EBT (Employee Benefit Trust) tax case.<br><br>Last night Whyte  insisted  the Ticketus deal was normal practice for clubs and his  spokesman said:  &quot;The suggestion that the Rangers takeover was funded  through financing  arrangements on season tickets is categorically  untrue.<br><br>&quot;Rangers  FC is no different in that it has a working  capital facility with  Ticketus, as have many, many other clubs. It is a  common arrangement in  football. This facility was in place at Ibrox  long before the takeover.&quot;<br><br>The EBT ruling is due within weeks and if Rangers lose they will be facing financial meltdown.<br><br>Their debt could then be in the &pound;75m region with liquidation a stark reality.<br><br>But   many now fear Rangers could be tipped over the abyss and into some  kind  of insolvency even before their Judgment Day over the tax case.<br>paul murray takeover plan would prevent another cash crisis to cripple rangers<br><br>Rangers   fans put their faith in Whyte believing he would get rid of the club&#39;s   debt and also provide transfer money for manager Ally McCoist, who has   been an impoverished bystander during this transfer window.<br><br>But   the Ibrox club&#39;s support will be shocked by the detail of invoices and   letters now in the revenue&#39;s possession. It is claimed these show  Whyte  sold off massive chunks of Rangers&#39; future season-ticket sales.<br><br>And   former board member Murray believes the takeover wouldn&#39;t have been   possible without the fans, even though they had no idea future tickets   had been sold off to raise extra cash.<br><br>Murray said: &quot;These   documents prove to me that Rangers fans have actually paid and will   continue to pay for the sale of their club.&quot;<br><br>He added that HMRC   have told him they are also due VAT, as much as &pound;5m, on the deal with   Ticketus and insists he has seen details of letters and invoices held by   HMRC.<br><br>Murray claims that in one of the documents, a letter  dated  March 8, 2011 and signed by Whyte, it is alleged he made it clear  that  through Wavetower, his bid vehicle at the time, he would be  entering  into a deal to sell the season tickets to a company called  Ticketus.<br><br>They  are part of London-based Octopus, a perfectly  legitimate lender who  grant immediate loans based on future ticket  sales. Record Sport managed  to speak with most of the people who were  on the Rangers board at the  time of the takeover and they insist they  knew nothing about the sale of  season tickets. In fact they tried to  ring-fence supporters&#39; money.<br><br>The  papers, which are being pored  over by HMRC officials, are said to  reveal borrowing against ticket  sales for seasons 2011-12, 12-13 and  13-14 that Whyte was able to raise  &pound;24.4m.<br><br>Then on June 27 he was  hit with the first of his  repayment bills from Ticketus, who were  demanding a total of &pound;9.5m,  their share of that summer&#39;s season-ticket  sales. Whyte could only come  up with &pound;3.5m cash and to fill the  shortfall mortgaged off part of  season 2014-15 to the value of &pound;6m.<br><br>Opening in March last year Murray claims the detail contained within HMRC&#39;s file is extensive and explosive.<br><br>This   is the timetable and interpretation of events: March 8, 2011: A letter   from Liberty Capital (one of Whyte&#39;s companies) is signed by Whyte and   addressed to Ticketus.<br><br>In the letter Whyte confirms the intention to sell Rangers&#39; season tickets to Ticketus.<br><br>April   7: Lawyers on behalf of Ticketus deposit &pound;24.4m into a Collyer Bristow   (lawyers for Whyte&#39;s bid) client account. A further &pound;2m was placed in   the same account from a company called JLT Benefit Solutions with &pound;1m   from the Merchant House Group, a firm of corporate finance specialists   with whom Whyte is closely linked.<br><br>May 9: An agreement was   entered into between Ticketus and Rangers to sell the season   tickets.This was just three days after the takeover date of May 6. The   bank was repaid the &pound;18m.<br><br>June 27: Ticketus raised an invoice to   Rangers seeking first repayment of &pound;9.5m on their agreement. Rangers   paid only &pound;3.5m of that amount in cash and borrowed &pound;6m more from   Ticketus by selling another portion of 2013-14 as well as a portion of   season 2014-15. Analysts stress there is nothing illegal in selling   future ticket sales. In fact, it is common practice in British football,   although the problems encountered by Leeds United and Newcastle  United,  who both borrowed too often and too much, are proof of the  dangers.<br><br>Whyte has never declared the deals with Ticketus although HMRC documents suggest he has cashed in on fan loyalty.<br><br>The tax officials quizzed Murray and South African-based King, who was on conference call, as recently as last Friday morning.<br><br>They   insisted they had no knowledge of what had been happening and Murray,   who last year offered to take the club off Lloyds&#39; books and invest  &pound;15m  in the team in a last-ditch attempt to prevent Whyte from getting  the  club, said he couldn&#39;t believe what he was reading when presented  with  the HMRC file.<br><br>&quot;HMRC asked for a meeting at the end of last  week  to find out what knowledge I, having been a director of the club  at the  time, had of these transactions prior to the takeover,&quot; Murray  said.<br><br>&quot;I  knew nothing about this and although I have been  questioned by HMRC and  seen some especially revealing documents which  are in their possession,  it is still very hard to take in what has been  going on.<br><br>&quot;Collyer  Bristow were acting for Craig Whyte during  the takeover and I have been  shown their client account, from the  opening of it until today.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve also seen all invoices from Ticketus to Rangers and Rangers to Ticketus supporting all these actions.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe Rangers have been handed over in this way.<br><br>&quot;Remember   also, the Independent Board, set up to make sure any potential buyers   were capable of making the purchase and then funding the business,  asked  repeatedly where Craig Whyte was getting the money.<br><br>&quot;He  said it  was from his own personal wealth and through Liberty Capital,  which he  insisted he owned 100 per cent, in the British Virgin Islands.<br><br>&quot;Plans   were being made to sell off future ticket sales but the directors were   never told. This was all being done behind our backs.&quot;<br><br>King was   also shocked to learn of the seasonticket sale and said: &quot;Securitising   season tickets is a valid seasonal funding strategy to smooth cash  flows  within the year - but no longer.&quot;<br><br>Whyte&#39;s spokesman added:  &quot;The  takeover team instigated discussions with Ticketus prior to the  takeover  because the relationship with Rangers was already in place and  the new  owners wanted to continue it.<br><br>&quot;They were clear from the  outset  they wanted to ensure there were robust working capital  provisions in  place that could deal with the many financial challenges  the club faces.<br><br>&quot;The  takeover was funded by one of Mr Whyte&#39;s  companies. Several months  before then - and long before any discussions  with Ticketus - Mr Whyte  was asked to provide proof of funds for the  takeover and he did that to  the satisfaction of the previous owners,  Lloyds Banking Group and  professional advisers.&quot;<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Ex-Rangers chairman Alistair Johnston: Administration looks inevitable for my old club</h3>Jan 31 2012<br>HE was hours away from being publicly unmasked as Rangers&rsquo; Whyte Knight in waiting.<br><br>Craig   Whyte, a reclusive, self-made mystery man from Motherwell, was on the   verge of making his first move to become the new king of Ibrox &ndash; and   being catapulted from obscurity into the public eye for the first time   in all of his 39 years.<br><br>It was Thursday night, November 17, 2010.   Whyte &ndash; knowing the story of his takeover plan was about to break in   the following day&rsquo;s Daily Record &ndash; rushed in a team of PR gurus whose   job it was to brief reporters on his behalf.<br><br>When the hired help   was asked for details of the exact extent of their man&rsquo;s wealth, the   answer came back, loud and clear: &ldquo;Describe him as a billionaire&rdquo;.<br><br>But   over the rocky, financially troubled 15 months which have followed,   those figures have rarely looked like adding up. And this morning comes   the most damning allegation of all. That Whyte has mortgaged off four   years&rsquo; worth of fans&rsquo; hard-earned season-ticket cash to pay his club&rsquo;s   running costs.<br><br>This astonishing claim has surfaced after   high-level officials from HMRC quizzed current director Dave King and   Paul Murray, who was removed from the board by Whyte shortly after he   had won his battle for control of the club.<br><br>The authorities   believe Whyte now owes the taxman &pound;5million in VAT from the &pound;24.4m deal   they say was done with London-based firm Ticketus, a subsidiary of   parent company Octopus.<br><br>Now this would-be &ldquo;billionaire&rdquo; has   managed to run up so much debt in his 10 months in charge he has been   left trying to flog star striker Nikica Jelavic before tonight&rsquo;s   transfer deadine just to keep the wolf from the door.<br><br>It&rsquo;s a far   cry from the bold promises of big spending with which Whyte&rsquo;s new era   was trumpeted when, on May 6 of last year, he announced he had finally   bought Sir David Murray&rsquo;s shareholding for the price of just &pound;1.<br><br>But   one man feared from the start it was all doomed to end in tears. And   last night former chairman Alistair Johnston &ndash; the man who warned fans   to &ldquo;remain vigilant&rdquo; on the day he handed over the keys of Ibrox &ndash;   expressed his fear that Rangers are now hurtling towards unavoidable   administration after the news four years&rsquo; worth of season tickets have   been flogged off to London.<br><br>Speaking from the States last night,   Johnston said: &ldquo;We asked Murray International to ask that specific   question: Is he raising the money to buy the club or to finance the   operations of the club against the assets of Rangers Football Club?<br>&ldquo;He said he wasn&rsquo;t doing it. But we didn&rsquo;t believe him.<br><br>&ldquo;We   were trying to say at the time that selling the club to Craig Whyte   could be a disaster. We were ridiculed by a lot of people for saying it   but I take no gratification or satisfaction from being proved right.<br><br>&ldquo;Inevitably,   it was only a matter of time before this happened. The destiny of the   club is now clearly not in its own  hands &ndash; it&rsquo;s in the hands of   Octopus.<br><br>&ldquo;Unfortunately I think administration is now almost   inevitable because the club&rsquo;s debts are unsustainable and Octopus want   their money back.<br><br>&ldquo;In my view, the only way the club can clear   these debts now is by going into administration. I just wonder if he   still has his position as the secured creditor. It was always his   intention to be the guy on the other side of the river when the club   came out of administration. But it looks to me as if Octopus is now   essentially the secured creditor.&rdquo;<br><br>Johnston says his suspicions   were aroused about Whyte&rsquo;s intentions from early on in the takeover   saga. And the alarm bells were clattering louder than ever on the day   after the newly- installed supremo watched Walter Smith and his team   wrap up a third successive title at Rugby Park in May.<br><br>He added:   &ldquo;First, during the process of due diligence it became clear he didn&rsquo;t   care about cash flow. That indicated to us they were in for a short   ride. They had no interest in operating the club.<br><br>&ldquo;Also, the day   after we won the championship at Kilmarnock I had a meeting with Whyte   and his lawyer during which they both asked me to disband the   Independent Committee.<br><br>&ldquo;They said now the sale had taken place the Independent Committee had no value.<br><br>&ldquo;I said no as I had a written agreement we would remain in place until he provided our shareholders with a circular.<br><br>&ldquo;That   was a warning. They were trying to get rid of us because they knew at   that point in time they had embarked on a track of borrowing against   season-ticket money.<br><br>&ldquo;He had told us it was all his money and it hadn&rsquo;t been borrowed against the assets.<br><br>&ldquo;He   then used all sorts of excuses to get myself, Paul Murray, Martin Bain   and Donald McIntyre off the board. The day before that happened I had   seen the latest financial statements and knew there was a real problem.<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s   why they got us out. They knew we would never approve their plan. They   then spent the next couple of months discrediting us and saying we  were  yesterday&rsquo;s men. But we knew we were right. We knew we had an  obligation  to the fans and shareholders.<br><br>&ldquo;But he launched a very  effective  PR campaign and used lawyers to intimidate everyone. He made  out any  criticism of Craig Whyte was actually an attack on Rangers.  Fans rallied  around him.&ldquo;<br><br>But it was like a human shield. He used Rangers Football Club as a human shield to protect himself.&rdquo;<br><br>Last   night Whyte denied any suggestion he had used tickets cash to buy the   club. A spokesman said: &ldquo;It is disgraceful that at every turn there are   people who continue to damage Rangers &ndash; people who when they were  asked  to step up and rescue the club were all talk and no action.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Rangers icon John Greig &amp; ex-chairman John McClelland deliver stark warning to owner Craig Whyte: Don&#39;t ruin our club</h3><br>Feb 1 2012 Exclusive by James Traynor<br><br>RANGERS   legend John Greig and former chairman John McClelland joined forces   last night to warn the club are in danger of being sucked into a debt   spiral.<br><br>Both had stayed silent since Craig Whyte gained control   last May but revelations in yesterday&rsquo;s Daily Record about season ticket   dealings prompted them to speak out.<br><br>Both resigned from the board, insisting they had been frozen out of the decision making process.<br><br>Their   departures followed Donald McIntyre&rsquo;s resignation as a director,   leaving South Africa-based Dave King as the sole survivor of the   previous regime.<br><br>And last night it was understood King was clinging to his seat on the board despite pressure from Whyte to quit.<br><br>While   Whyte was penning an open letter to the supporters claiming our   exclusive report was untrue, Greig, voted the greatest ever Ranger, and   McClelland were adamant they had been told nothing while still members   of Whyte&rsquo;s board.<br><br>And they fear the club could be rushing down a one-way street by spending advances on future season tickets.<br><br>Like   many Rangers supporters, Greig and McClelland are alarmed and dismayed   by the negativity which continues to swirl around Ibrox.<br><br>The former directors believe the financial turmoil has stripped the club of its dignity.<br><br>They spoke out after yesterday&rsquo;s disclosures and as striker Nikica Jelavic quit to join Everton.<br><br>McClelland   said: &ldquo;When you consider the effort that was put in to make sure the   club would always have its dignity, it is very sad.<br><br>&ldquo;In a matter of only months all that could be damaged further.&rdquo;<br><br>Greig,   who was forced to end a 50-year association with the club because of   the new regime&rsquo;s lack of transparency, said: &ldquo;Like the other directors, I   had no knowledge of what was happening.<br><br>&ldquo;The news of all those   tickets being sold off is disturbing as this club has always been   special to me and any adverse publicity it receives hurts greatly.

It may still be possible to avert this but that   is not the most likely way forward.<br><br>&quot;What is of paramount importance is the long-term security, survival and prosperity of this great football club.&quot;<br><br>Mr   Whyte said it was &quot;in the best interests of Rangers&quot; that his ongoing   restructuring of the club was &quot;completed before the end of this  season&quot;.<br><br>He said this had &quot;meant turbulent times&quot; as the club sought to &quot;stand on its own feet, earning more than it spends&quot;.<br><br>&quot;From   my early days as chairman I saw that administration was a very real   option to enable the club to address these challenges and make a fresh   start,&quot; he said.<br>&#39;Great institution&#39;<br><br>&quot;Frankly, the case for   administration in pure financial terms was compelling but I was acutely   aware that such a great institution as Rangers could not be viewed   exclusively in financial and business terms.<br><br>&quot;The fact is that Rangers&#39; ongoing financial position and the HMRC first tier tribunal are inextricably linked.&quot;<br><br>The   Rangers chairman stated again that the club was running a &pound;10m annual   deficit and it was in the best interests of the club to cut costs   significantly.<br><br>He continued: &quot;There is no realistic or practical   alternative to our approach because HMRC has made it plain to the club   that should we be successful in the forthcoming tax tribunal decision   they will appeal the decision.<br><br>&quot;This would leave the club facing   years of uncertainty and also having to pay immediately a range of   liabilities to HMRC which will be due whatever the overall result of the   tax tribunal.<br><br>&quot;In blunt terms, if we waited until the outcome  of  the tax tribunal, the risk of Rangers being faced with an  unacceptable  financial burden and years of uncertainty is too great.&quot;<br><br>Mr  Whyte  said the tax case related to &quot;a claim by HMRC for unpaid taxes  over a  period of several years dating back to 2001&quot; which Rangers would  be  unable to pay if the tribunal went against the club.<br><br>He said Rangers&#39; immediate future now lay in the hands of HMRC.<br><br>The   chairman said: &quot;If HMRC were to agree, even at this late stage, a   manageable agreement with the club, then a formal insolvency procedure   could yet be averted. It goes without saying that would be our preferred   outcome.<br><br>&quot;If not, further investment in the club would be impossible as the threat of winding up by HMRC cannot be removed.<br><br>&quot;The   Rangers FC Group, the majority shareholder in the club, is prepared to   provide further funding for the club on the basis the funding is   ring-fenced from the legacy HMRC issue.&quot;<br><br>Mr Whyte said Rangers   had engaged a specialist restructuring practice, Duff and Phelps, to   assist in finding a solution to the present position.<br><br>He added:   &quot;As a result of that advice, it has been decided to seek the protection   of a moratorium from HMRC action whilst a Company Voluntary Arrangement   (CVA) proposal is made to creditors.<br><br>&quot;This, if approved by   creditors within a month, would minimise any points deduction and allow   the club to participate in European football.<br><br>&quot;In short, if the   club proceeds into administration then it will have to emerge from that   process, with the agreement of creditors, within a month or so in  order  to be able to play in Europe next season.&quot;<br>&#39;Financially fitter&#39;<br><br>Mr   Whyte said administration would &quot;regrettably lead to a cost-cutting   programme and the potential loss of jobs across the business&quot;.<br><br>He said former directors may &quot;contend that the steps we are announcing today are unnecessary&quot;.<br><br>&quot;All   I would say to these people is that if they want to step up to the   plate and invest money in Rangers to avoid a restructuring of the   business, then I would be most willing to talk to them,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;In   the past unfortunately, there were people who not only failed to   prevent Rangers being engulfed by our current problems but chose not to   invest their money to help put it right.&quot;<br><br>Mr Whyte said Rangers could &quot;emerge as a stronger and financially fitter organisation&quot; from this process.<br><br>He   statement concluded: &quot;As chairman of the club, every action I take  will  be in the interests of Rangers and there are many people working  at the  club who are dedicated to making Rangers a success.<br><br>&quot;I  would  like to thank supporters for their great commitment to Rangers.  This  great football club can recover from the situation in which it now  finds  itself and be the force in football that the fans deserve.&quot;<br><br>Mr Whyte is understood to be the club&#39;s main secured creditor via a floating charge over its assets.<br><br>This   would allow him to pursue other avenues such as receivership or   pre-pack administration to satisfy the debts which the club owes him if a   CVA cannot be secured.<br><br>These would involve transferring Rangers   assets out to another company or companies to satisfy outstanding  debts  to the floating charge holder and leaving the club behind with  the debt.<br><br>In such scenarios, it would be likely that Rangers FC - formed in 1873 - would be formally wound up.<br><br>  Tom English: When it comes to the truth, don&rsquo;t depend on Joe Blogs<br><br>Published on Sunday 30 October 2011 01:28<br><br>AN online Nostradamus was predicting the end of Rangers on Friday.<br><br>On   Twitter, there was talk of crisis meetings and bold predictions that   Craig Whyte had run out of money, that the club couldn&rsquo;t trade any   longer, that Armageddon had come early. This is the reality of the   online blogger. They can spout stuff that turns out to be untrue and,   when they get it wrong, it never boomerangs back and hurts them. They   carry on untouched by the laws of libel that the mainstream media have   to contend with and shielded from the mortification that a newspaper or   radio reporter would experience if he, or she, went off half-cocked  with  such a bombshell.<br><br>For instance, for months the same  soothsayer  said with all the certainty of a man who knew that night  followed day  that Whyte would never take over Rangers, that it was, in  fact, a  fakeover. Bloggers can get away with such blunders. It&rsquo;s not so  easy for  the rest of us. You learn to be cynical about the cyber  bombasts. At  the height of the online hysteria on Friday I received an  email from a  Celtic fan who berated me for missing the story of the  collapse of  Rangers, which was happening &ldquo;right this minute&rdquo; at Ibrox.  Nostradamus  said it. Must be true. He wanted to know why I was ignoring  the story.  This is what you&rsquo;re dealing with. It could well be that,  within a few  weeks, Rangers go into administration. That could very  well happen.  Whyte has confirmed it, albeit after a long period when he  denied it, a  spell of many months that only added to his mystery and  the suspicion  that surrounds him. But it hasn&rsquo;t happened yet. These  breathless,  hair-on-fire dispatches from the frontline of an Old Firm  crisis zone,  these supposed exclusives from the blog-o-sphere that  we&rsquo;re expected to  chase like a cat would a mouse? Sorry, most of them  come and go without a  squeak of truth.<br><br><br><br><br>Daily Record Column<br>by jim Traynor<br> <br>   AS Rangers lurch ever closer to the abyss, their owner, Craig Whyte,   continues to protest his innocence. Debts pile up and all he can say is   &quot;it wasnae me&quot;.<br> <br> But blaming the previous board for today&#39;s mess is lame. It&#39;s also a distortion of the truth.<br> <br>   Just listen to yourself, Craig. For the sake of the club and the fans   stop pointing the finger at others and tell it like it really is.<br> <br>   Get it out there in the open. You&#39;ll feel better. You might hold on to   the fans and perhaps even preserve what&#39;s left of Rangers&#39; dignity.<br> <br>   A barrage of negative headlines, constant legal wrangles and a   staggering level of naivety in the transfer market have dragged Rangers   through the mud. This club&#39;s credibility has never been so low.<br> <br>   Of course the old board were less than perfect but Whyte himself   declared the club debt free the day he paid off Lloyds Bank with   &pound;18million.<br> <br> Yet nine months on Rangers fans fear closure.<br> <br> So who is really responsible? You cannot blame people who weren&#39;t even there.<br> <br>   If Rangers do go under before the final decision on the EBT tax case  is  announced, that will be mainly down to Whyte and, of course, those  who  advised and helped him structure his buy-out and strategy for  taking the  club on.<br> <br> Remember them? You must have seen those  city slickers  who marched triumphantly down Edmiston Drive and in  through the Ibrox  front door last May.<br> <br> It was just after the  takeover had been  signed off and policemen on horseback parted the  crowd so they could  flounce down the road. They were so pleased with  themselves.<br> <br>  But now that the business plan seems flawed and  the cash flow appears to  be drying up as quickly as the debts pile up,  they are nowhere to be  seen.<br> <br> Whyte is still there, of course,  and Gary Withey remains  on the Ibrox board, although largely anonymous  and maybe even  speechless. Never a cheep from him, which is a pity  because it might be  interesting to talk with him about this curious  Rangers involvement with  Banstead Athletic, an amateur team in Surrey.<br> <br>  We&#39;re told this  is a heartwarming story about Rangers reaching out  into another  community. Bollocks. Rangers fans should be asking if this  bizarre link  has cost anything other than time.<br> <br> Then again,  in the business  world time usually means money and, who knows, there  could be hundreds,  if not thousands, of reasons for them to question  this tie-up.<br> <br> Next time I see an Ibrox director I&#39;ll remember to ask him. But not Phil Betts. He&#39;s gone.<br> <br>   He left the Ibrox board last month but what exactly did he do? What  was  his function? And although Whyte insists he himself has never taken  a  penny out of Rangers in salary or expenses, can the others say the  same?  And if none of the directors received payment, might someone know  if  money left the &quot;client account&quot;, set up by Whyte for the takeover,  on  September 8 last year? And if it did, to whom did it go? And for  what?  No point asking that other bloke, David Grier, who also appeared  to be a  member of the takeover crew. He knows nothing about Rangers&#39;  day-to-day  running or the state of the club&#39;s finances. He said so,  just the other  day.<br> <br> Yet in the lead-up to the buy-out he was  introduced to  Rangers&#39; board as a financial advisor and they continue  to insist Grier  spoke on various matters, including the &quot;big&quot; tax case  that could leave  Rangers facing a &pound;49m bill.<br> <br> They also believe  he accompanied  Donald McIntyre, who was Rangers&#39; finance director, to a  meeting with  the revenue about that very case. Surely not. After all,  only last week  Grier told Record Sport that he isn&#39;t a tax expert.<br> <br>  He also  said he had no knowledge of the &pound;24.4m Rangers raised by  selling off  tranches of future season tickets to Ticketus. But he&#39;d  made his lack of  intelligence on that front clear some time ago.<br> <br>  On April 27  last year to be precise. That was when he sent an email  stating that  Rangers - he wrote &quot;we&quot;, even though he also claims not to  have been  advising on the day-to-day operation - have yet to open any  discussions  with Ticketus.<br> <br> Strange that because, as has  already been  reported, a letter from Whyte&#39;s company, Liberty Capital,  and signed by  the owner to Ticketus, dated March 8, confirms the  intention to sell  season tickets.<br> <br> Then, on April 7, lawyers on behalf of Ticketus deposit &pound;24.4m into the client account.<br> <br>   So that means that 20 days after the money was in place no one had   bothered to tell Grier, who incidentally had actually been brought in by   Liberty Capital. Again, he said so himself.<br> <br> But he needn&#39;t   feel bad if he has been kept out of the loop. He has the same level of   importance as Rangers legions. Apparently they don&#39;t need to know   either.<br> <br> However, what we all know is this is a complicated   piece of business right enough and how Whyte, who always wanted to   become a major player in the world of high finance, must regret the   moment he decided to step into the glare of the floodlights.<br> <br>   From dabbling in plant hire and security firms, someone convinced him it   would be a good idea to try football, although to be fair to him he   might have seen some kind of analogy or connection.<br> <br> After all,   his goal when he started out in the worldofbusiness was to amass &quot;major   league personal wealth&quot;, likening the money to points in a game.<br> <br>   The idea, he explained, is to use those points, or wealth, to measure   yourself against the Bransons of this world. Of course that was before   he found himself in this pickle.<br> <br> And it was also when he was   manoeuvring under the radar in the world of corporate takeover and   recovery, often a very murky pool.<br> <br> The deeper you go the darker it becomes until it&#39;s impossible to see the great whites.<br> <br> And before you know it they&#39;ve bitten you right in the assets. Then, of course, it&#39;s too late.<br> <br>   Many believe it is already too late for Rangers and not because  they&#39;ve  been savaged by a bigger beast in the SPL playground. They have  been  brought to their knees by Whyte himself, even though he says he&#39;s  been  left to clean up the previous regime&#39;s mess.<br> <br> But even if  he  repeats this claim until he&#39;s blue in the face it won&#39;t make it any  more  believable. The EBT tax case apart, the problems threatening to  bring  Rangers down are of Whyte&#39;s making. With a little help from his  friends  of course.<br><br><br>Clear message for Greece and Rangers: do not spend what you cannot afford<br> Phil Gordon The Times<br><br>   &pound;14 million was spent on the Murray Park training gound, named after   the former owner, Sir David Murray, pictured SNS Group/Bill Murray<br><br>   There is a certain symbolism in Rangers&rsquo; financial problems being   stripped bare for all to see, on the same day that smoke billowed into   the sky above Athens as businesses were torched and anger erupted over   the Greek bailout crisis.<br><br> Just as at Ibrox, Greece is struggling   to face the future. The impoverished country and the perilous club   share a lot of things in common, that go beyond their beloved blue and   white colours. Both have spent too much on projects of vanity and now   neither has the money to cover the bills.<br><br> The medicine being   prescribed &mdash; in one case, by the EU and IMF and in the other, by HMRC &mdash;   is simply too unpalatable to the public who will pay the price for the   folly of others. We are unlikely to see copycat rioters hijack the   streets of Govan, the way Athens has suffered, but there is a clear   message that runs between the two places: do not spend what you cannot   afford.<br><br> The scale of Rangers&rsquo; liabilities is much worse than   anyone thought, mirroring the cavernous hole of debt that Greece is now   coming to terms with. Craig Whyte, the Rangers owner, stated on Sky   Sports last night that the tax bill to HMRC could reach &pound;75 million.   That was the sort of sum run up by Dick Adocaat just over a decade ago,   as Rangers lavished money on everything from the players to property.<br><br>   The record &pound;12 million fee spent on acquiring Tore Andr&eacute; Flo from   Chelsea &mdash; way beyond the striker&rsquo;s market value &mdash; and the &pound;14 million   spent on the Murray Park training gound, named after the former owner,   Sir David Murray, is just part of the evidence that financial prudence   was overlooked in favour of excess. It was Emperor&rsquo;s New Clothes.<br><br>   The Greeks went on a huge debt-funded spending spree to pay for   high-profile projects such as the Athens Olympics, which went well over   budget. Greece has also discovered that widespread tax evasion cost the   treasury billions of euros. Perhaps, the Greek government should have   enlisted HMRC to track down the money, because it has shown a stubborn   determination to get the money it claims it is owed from Rangers for  the  Employment Benefits Trust scheme that was set up in the 1990s to  pay  players and staff.<br><br> HMRC believe that the club misused the  scheme  and avoided paying significant sums in tax. That is bad enough  for the  millions of ordinary tax-payers to accept, but if you have run a   football club in Scotland and had to waive the chance to bring in new   players because you could not afford them, it is unlikely to generate   much solidarity from within the football community.<br><br> If Rangers   do go into administration, they are unlikely to find the hat being   passed round Scottish football to provide some sustenance. Gretna went   into administration in March 2008, as the club paid the price for a wage   bill they could never sustain. The terminal illness of the club&rsquo;s late   owner, Brooks Mileson, created an instant cashflow problem and even   though the Scottish Premier League advanced some funds to the stricken   club, in lieu of television contract money, it was simply a sticking   plaster.<br><br> Gretna failed to finish the season. They went out of   business, while footballers and ordinary staff were made redundant as   the administrators moved in with ruthless efficiency. Motherwell, Dundee   and Livingston been down that road before. They all survived, though   Livingston were demoted to the Scottish third division for a second   bankruptcy in 2008.<br><br> Whyte said yesterday that he had taken the   decision to embrace administration because it was to protect the   long-term future of the club, but no one can make such guarantees. There   is a harsh realism out there, that kicked in after the global economic   downturn, and few can stake their reputation on anything financial,  any  more. The Rangers supporters know that with the same clarity as the   people of Greece.<br><br> The only thing that is guaranteed, is that   football no longer has an immunity from paying for the excess of the   past. All over Europe, clubs are either on the brink of collapse, or   have gone under. Even in sensible places, like Switzerland, the home of   banking, where Neuchatel Xamax have just been stripped of their licence   and thrown into the fifth division because the owner had not paid  social  security bills or players&rsquo; wages.<br><br> Perhaps, Neuchatel got  off  lightly. Two clubs that Rangers supporters will recognise after  playing  them in European competition, have suffered the ultimate price.   Strasbourg are no more. Unirea Urziceni, no more. Demoted for  financial  mismanagement, then wound up last summer. Rangers must hope  their tale  has a different ending.<br><br><br><br><br>Would Scotland miss Rangers?<br>By Eurosport | Desmond Kane &ndash; Fri, Feb 10, 2012 17:38 GMTEmail<br><br>Rangers &#39;fans&#39; at the 2008 UEFA Cup final in Manchester<br><br>Of   all the quotes that can be regurgitated relating to the darker side of   Rangers and a helping of the imbeciles that have clamped themselves to   the Glasgow club seemingly since time began, Ian Archer&#39;s musings  remain  perhaps the most pertinent. It was penned over 30 years ago.  &quot;This has  to be said about Rangers, as a Scottish football club they  are a  permanent embarrassment and an occasional disgrace. This country  would  be a better place if Rangers did not exist,&quot; wrote Archer, who  latterly  worked on the now departed television programme Scotsport, in a  Glasgow  newspaper.<br><br>What was exceptional about Archer&#39;s  heartfelt words is  that they were scribbled down during some of the  finer moments in  Rangers&#39; history, specifically alluding to a night  when they snagged the  old European Cup Winners&#39; Cup in Barcelona in  1972 with a 3-2 victory  over Dynamo Moscow. As a piece of newspaper  prose, it was ahead of its  time.<br><br>Inspired by beers and cheap  wine while being firmly planted  in Spain, a Roman Catholic country at  odds with the anti-Catholic  signing policy once employed by Rangers and  endorsed by its supporters, a  furious rump of followers battled with  riot police in the Camp Nou amid  their team&#39;s rise to clasp the only  European trophy in the club&#39;s  history.<br><br>It will be argued that  the heavy-handedness of local  police made the riots in Barcelona  eminently preventable, but then  Rangers seem to have spent large  swathes of their past defending the  extremist behaviour of those who  masquerade as football fans. The blame  always seems to fall on others.<br><br>In  a taxing period when a case  with HMRC threatens to capsize the club  with over &pound;50 million of debt,  it is perhaps Karma as much as unpaid  taxes and gross financial  mismanagement that has left Rangers facing  the trap door. Rangers may  well be left to pay the price for the sins  of the father, with or  without his sash, and their inability to drive  out the rancid element  that has tailed them.<br><br>They range from  their highly inflammatory  position in shying away from signing  Catholics, the racist and sectarian  songs sung by some followers of the  club, the orange shirts wheeled out  a decade ago as a &quot;Dutch tribute &quot;  marketing ploy and the wretched  riots in Manchester when a big screen  television went on the blink.  These are just some of the episodes that  have tarnished not only the  Rangers brand, but the image of Scotland as  a tolerant country.<br><br>Scottish  football may be left impoverished  by a league without Rangers, but will  society? Should society feel a  certain sadness towards the plight of  Rangers?<br><br>While the  Scottish Premier League, satellite television  and perhaps even twitchy  Celtic directors would lament the loss of the  income that Rangers  generate, a progressive Scotland may feel  differently.<br><br>At a time  when Scotland&#39;s first minister Alex  Salmond is trying to drive forward  the idea of an independent,  progressive, multicultural, multi-faith  Scotland - a rainbow nation of  Scots - the country&#39;s national sport is  perhaps the last public haunt  for the miserably uneducated. This was  seen and heard when Hearts and  Celtic exchanged lamentable ditties on  Wednesday evening that continues  to illustrate the deep-seated  anti-Catholic sentiment that exists in  pockets of Scotland. The  strained old IRA choruses were heard from the  visiting end amid the  pestilence. Tramps behave better.<br><br>Celtic  supporters are plagued  by their own unsavoury band, but have always been  uncomfortable with  the Old Firm tagline that they continue to share  with Rangers. The  racists who mingle among the football fans in using  the club to further  their warped ideology will remain intact, even if  Ibrox does not after  the tax hearing has been played out. This would be a  tragedy for a  club with so much potential.<br><br>For the decent  Rangers fans,  progressive people, who follow their club only as a  football team,  there is a genuine sympathy at how departed owner Sir  David Murray  allowed the club to fall into such a state, but there are  too many who  have been allowed to hijack the good name of Rangers to  further their  own ideals away from a sporting context. For them, there  will be no  sympathy.<br><br>Rangers may well survive in some form if  they fall  into administration, which would be heartening for the  national sport,  but would clubs outwith Glasgow such as Aberdeen,  Hearts, Hibernian,  Dundee United or Dundee be sorry to see them go?<br><br>To  the ones who  sing songs about child abuse and the Irish Potato Famine,  it is  difficult to argue that the air would not be cleaner if their club   stops. &quot;And because some people are so sick, I have to put six words at   the end of this column,&quot; wrote Archer. &quot;I am not a Roman Catholic.&quot;<br><br><br><br>Rangers in crisis: Administrator-in-waiting David Grier will be faced with biggest decisions in club&#39;s history<br><br>Feb 14 2012 By James Traynor<br><br>THE man in line to become Rangers&rsquo; administrator was right there with Craig Whyte when he took the keys to the Ibrox front door.<br><br>David   Grier was one of the city slickers who marched down Edmiston Drive on   May 7 last year, a day after Whyte had won control of Rangers.<br><br>He&rsquo;d   been commissioned by Whyte&rsquo;s Liberty Capital company to advise on the   takeover &ndash; and now his firm, Duff and Phelps, appear to be the  preferred  option as administrators.<br><br>We can reveal their people, described as restructuring specialists, will be at Ibrox today.<br><br>If Grier is with them, he&rsquo;ll notice a dramatic change in atmosphere, as well as welcome.<br><br>This time, he won&rsquo;t be cheered in by adoring fans.<br><br>This time, he&rsquo;s more likely to be jeered, just as all administrators are who enter the football arena.<br><br>They are feared by fans because they are responsible for axing staff and salaries.<br><br>Grier&rsquo;s   company will have to do exactly that to save Rangers from oblivion  only  nine months after Whyte had declared a bold new dawn &ndash; and a  debt-free  one at that. But how times have changed.<br><br>If Whyte gets his way, Grier will have the final say on which players stay and which ones have their contracts ripped up.<br><br>Many Rangers fans and the members of the previous board fear that other assets could also be sold off.<br><br>They   are concerned that Rangers &ndash; the company &ndash; could be broken up with  &ldquo;for  sale&rdquo; signs slapped on Ibrox, Murray Park and the Albion car park  to  raise money to pay off creditors.<br><br>The club would then have to  pay  rent for use of the properties and that would severely restrict   Rangers&rsquo; ability to generate enough profit to make the team stronger.<br><br>That&rsquo;s   a doomsday scenario. But even if the business isn&rsquo;t splintered, the   administrator will still have to make some of the toughest and most   far-reaching decisions in the club&rsquo;s 139-year history.<br><br>He will also have to negotiate with HMRC, who are still confident of winning their Employee Benefit Trust case against Rangers.<br><br>That   could land the club with a crippling &pound;49million bill and last night   Whyte claimed that figure could rise as high, with penalties, as   &pound;75million.<br><br>That sounds like scaremongering on a grand scale but   even so, the administrator knows he might have to cut a deal with the   taxman because Whyte has decided not to wait until the final ruling,   which will be announced in a couple of weeks.<br><br>There would be   absolutely no point in entering administration, paying off creditors and   then exiting only to find HMRC waiting for him with their tab &ndash; no   matter the amount.<br><br>So Grier would be tasked with bringing the   taxman to the negotiating table and attempting to reach a compromise   which could see millions wiped off any debt.<br><br>Then again, Whyte,   like many who have followed this tax saga, might really believe Rangers   will be left with only penalties of no more than &pound;10million to pay.<br><br>So he could be gambling on a quick in and out of administration.<br><br>He   might be able to pay a decent sum in the pound to creditors and that   would make it easier for the administrator to wrap things up quickly.<br><br>The taxman would prove a much more difficult customer.<br><br>Whyte did say when he took over that he could handle a tax bill of around &pound;12million and that might still be the case.<br><br>But   first the administrator, who will be appointed by Whyte because he&rsquo;s   the main creditor, will have to be sure of cutting a deal.<br><br>Grier probably believed he&rsquo;d done his bit to move Rangers on to a more solid base nine months ago.<br><br>Now he has to do it all over again and this time it might be even tougher.<br><br>He&rsquo;ll have to cope with resentment from within Ibrox and Murray Park, where he might even be regarded as an enemy.<br><br>But   that can be the nature of his work and if he gets this right and turns   Rangers around, he could yet become known as something of a saviour.<br><br><br><br><br>Rangers fans could be key to club&#39;s survival says football finance expert<br><br>Feb 13 2012<br><br>A FOOTBALL finance expert has backed Rangers to respond with the help of their supporters should they enter administration.<br><br>The   club today lodged their intention to enter administration and would be   hit with a 10-point penalty if they proceed to appoint administrators.<br><br>Professor   Tom Cannon of the University of Liverpool believes a fan ownership   model, like those adopted in Germany, could be the way forward to boost   the club&#39;s long-term health.<br><br>He said: &quot;It will be the biggest club in the world to have gone into administration.<br><br>&quot;It   is a giant which has been felled. It shouldn&#39;t be a surprise but it is  a  tragedy because they are a great club with great tradition.<br><br>&quot;It won&#39;t be the end of Rangers. It&#39;s possible that gives the opportunity to create a German-style sports club out of the ashes.<br><br>&quot;None of this stops Rangers being, in terms of the fan base, one of the giants of world football.&quot;<br><br>Despite   the supporters being a possible solution to the current predicament,   the need to meet their expectations was perhaps also a mitigating factor   in the current circumstances, Cannon believes.<br><br>&quot;Rangers are one of the giants, not just of Scottish football, but of world football,&quot; he added.<br><br>&quot;If they&#39;re not in the top 10 supported soccer clubs in the world, they&#39;re certainly in the top 20.<br><br>&quot;To some degree, that&#39;s been part of the problem. They have this giant fan base and those fans have expectations.<br><br>&quot;The problem is matching those expectations with the revenues a Scottish Premier League team can get.<br><br>&quot;The revenues, particularly from television, can&#39;t sustain the expectations of that fan base.&quot;<br><br>The deal which saw Craig Whyte assume ownership from Sir David Murray last year may also have had an impact.<br><br>&quot;Changes   of ownership are never cheap, particularly when you&#39;re talking about a   big club - there&#39;s always a big bill,&quot; Cannon added.<br><br>Rangers  will  need to address the issue of their outstanding debts to survive  and the  club could be forced into selling their Ibrox home or Murray  Park  training facility, Cannon warned.<br><br>He said: &quot;Unless they&#39;re going to get a 10p or a 20p in the pound deal, they&#39;re going to have to dispose of major assets.<br><br>&quot;They haven&#39;t got that many valuable assets on the field, so what assets are they going to dispose of?&quot;<br><br><br>[b]The Financial Times[/b] :clap:<br><br>[quote]February 13, 2012 9:52 pm<br>Rangers lodges papers for administration<br><br>By Andrew Bolger<br>Rangers FC Lodge&copy;Getty<br><br>Rangers, the 140-year-old Scottish football club, has lodged legal papers signalling it intends to enter administration.<br><br>The   move came as the defending Scottish champion &ndash; which with Glasgow   Celtic forms the &ldquo;Old Firm&rdquo;, one of football&rsquo;s oldest rivalries &ndash; awaits   the verdict of a tax tribunal that could cost it &pound;49m.The HM Revenue   &amp; Customs case concerns the use of employee benefits trusts, under   which clubs pay players&rsquo; wages into offshore trusts to avoid national   insurance.<br><br>HMRC last week lost a high-profile case alleging tax   evasion against Harry Redknapp, the Tottenham manager, when he was   formerly at Portsmouth.<br><br>In the event of victory against Rangers, the Revenue is expected to pursue other football clubs and businesses.<br><br>The benefits trusts were established when Sir David Murray, the metals and property magnate, was club chairman.<br><br>Last   May he sold his majority stake for &pound;1 to Craig Whyte, a Scottish   venture capitalist, who paid off the &pound;18m owed by the club to Lloyds   Banking Group.<br><br>Rangers said last night it was continuing to have   &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; with HMRC in the hope a formal insolvency procedure could be   averted.

Picture: SNS<br> The club have endured a trying season, but the situation reached a nadir as papers were lodged with the Court of Session.<br> <br>   It was all a far cry from the heady days enjoyed by Johnstone &ndash; who   made over 350 appearances over two spells at the Ibrox club &ndash; which was   punctuated by domestic success and victory in the European Cup Winners&#39;   Cup in 1972. A proud Rangers supporter, Johnstone is shaken by events  at  Ibrox.<br> <br> &quot;Yesterday was one of the worst days of my life. I  have  never been embarrassed to be a Rangers man, but yesterday I was,&quot;  said  the former Ibrox striker. &quot;I have never been ashamed to be part of  this  club, never. Not when things have been poor on the park, not  during any  time of adversity. But what has happened at Rangers these  past few  months has been cringe-worthy.<br> <br> &quot;Ever since the news  broke I  have had a sickness in the pit of my stomach. Even now I cannot  believe  it. I know that there have been suggestions that this was  coming, but I  don&#39;t think anyone appreciated just how bad the situation  was.<br> <br>  &quot;We have all spoken about the possibility of the club  going into  administration and there have been rumblings about it all  season, but I  cannot believe how quickly it has happened. Like every  other Rangers  fan, I am shattered. It is frankly awful news. Right now,  the league  title does not matter one jot. What is at stake is the very  existence of  the club, its very fabric. It is gut-churning to think  about the future  and the struggles that lie ahead in simply ensuring  the club actually  stays alive. Yes, it is that serious.&quot;<br> <br>  Rangers also yesterday  announced that Daniel Cousin had returned to the  club until the end of  the season. The signing was supposed to assuage  some of the discontent  felt by supporters after the sale of Nikica  Jelavic on the final day of  the transfer window, but instead it has  left a bitter taste.<br> <br>  &quot;That makes no sense whatsoever and only  shows how much Ally McCoist  [the Rangers manager] has been kept in the  dark about what has really  being going on at the club,&quot; said Johnstone.  &quot;Why sign up to spend &pound;7500  a week on a player if you&#39;re going into  administration? Like so many  things under Craig Whyte&#39;s regime, it does  not add up.<br> <br> &quot;Who  could ever have thought a club like Rangers,  one of the great  institutions of the Scottish game, could end up in  this sorry, dreadful  mess. There are two men who need to stand up and  take the blame &ndash; David  Murray and Craig Whyte. The buck stops with both  of them. [Murray] dug  the hole, but as if that wasn&#39;t enough, he then  sold Rangers down the  river when he turned control of the club over to  Whyte.&quot;<br> <br> The  culpability of Murray &ndash; who sold Rangers to Whyte  last year &ndash; will have  been debated by disillusioned supporters last  night, but Johnstone was  scathing in his assessment of the former  chairman&#39;s stewardship. In  particular, he criticised the decision to  hand the club over to Whyte.<br> <br>  &quot;What is particularly galling is  the fact that every member of the  Ibrox board warned him against the  deal,&quot; he said. &quot;They did not trust  Whyte, they were suspicious of him  from the start and they did not want  the running of the club put into  his hands. But Murray ignored those  concerns and he has to be  answerable for that.<br> <br> &quot;Where is the  money from the sale of  Nikica Jelavic? Where is the money that [Whyte]  was putting into the  club? He has not invested a single penny in Rangers  since he took over.  In the last 40 years I have known every Rangers  director, every one.  They have been proper gentlemen and they have been  proper businessmen.  John Lawrence would be turning in his grave. Craig  Whyte might be a  reasonably successful businessman, but he does not know  football?<br> <br>  &quot;I will watch with interest to see just what Sir  David Murray has to  say on the matter. He most certainly does not walk  out of this debacle  without taking a massive portion of the blame.&quot;<br><br><br><br><br>Rangers are down to their last out<br>When Saturay Comes<br>14 February 2012<br><br>You   know things are bad when the baseball metaphors start flying about.   Since assuming ownership of Rangers in May of last year, Craig Whyte has   continually reminded his growing band of critics that he was the only   man willing to &quot;step up to the plate&quot; and buy a club dogged by existing   and projected debts. Now he has filed his intention to appoint   administrators, Rangers fans are worried their club is about to become   Scottish football&#39;s Brooklyn Dodgers. The franchise is not about to   leave town, but it is on the cusp of reverting to the minor leagues.<br><br>As   with every other financial announcement from Ibrox over the last   decade, the only thing made perfectly clear today is that Rangers are in   dire straits. Whyte&#39;s statement sums up his nine-month tenure as   chairman. It is characterised by obfuscation, fear tactics, nebulous   reassurances and infantile digs at the previous board and owner.<br><br>The   statement makes it plain the club will go into administration in ten   days&#39; time unless a financial miracle intervenes. Yet it places great   emphasis on the notion that, until February 22, everything is just   hunkydory on and off the pitch. Then it continues to tell every Rangers   fan that administration is the best way for the club to proceed.<br><br>When   Whyte attempted to rally the supporters on the steps of Ibrox on  Monday  night he was roundly abused by the concerned crowd on Edmiston  Drive.  Having bought the club on a ticket of saving it from financial  meltdown,  he is increasingly viewed as the man who has taken Rangers  one step  closer to oblivion. This is not entirely fair or accurate.<br><br>The   massive tax bill hanging over the club is the legacy of the previous   owner, Sir David Murray. It was widely reported if Rangers lose the   tribunal the bill would be anything up to &pound;49 million. Whyte admitted on   Monday that it could be far larger. A bill of any such size would   necessitate administration, purely in order for a club with so many   other outstanding debts to have any chance of avoiding outright   liquidation.<br><br>Whyte has done himself no PR favours. In January he   was revealed to have mortgaged &pound;24m worth of future season ticket  sales,  possibly to fund his takeover. He then sold top scorer Nikica  Jelavic  to Everton for a knock-down price, while making a bogus attempt  to buy  Norwich&#39;s Grant Holt. Signing out-of-contract Daniel Cousin  just hours  before announcing the move towards administration seemed  like one final  dodgy deal from a man who was struck off as a company  director for seven  years. The SFA are currently investigating whether  he is a fit and  proper person to run one of their clubs.<br><br>Whyte&#39;s  wars with the  BBC and the Daily Record have not helped Rangers&#39;  traditional image,  however apocryphal, as the nation&#39;s &quot;establishment&quot;  club. Administration  could strengthen Whyte&#39;s position as owner as he  is also one of the  club&#39;s larger creditors. He is failing to win  trophies - one of the many  positives Murray kept supplying no matter  the accounting anomalies.<br><br>The  early move towards administration,  which will incur a  title-surrendering ten-point deduction, seems to be  changing the game to  one Whyte knows how to play. He is primarily  aiming to circumvent the  HM Revenue and Customs, who have been bleeding  the club dry by delaying  the final ruling of the tax tribunal.<br><br>When  all is considered &ndash;  history, trophies, media coverage, attendances &ndash;  Rangers make up a third  of Scottish football. This is probably an  underestimate of the kind  that put us in such trouble with the tax  authorities. But Rangers fans  expect and want no sympathy. We have won  one third of the domestic  trophies available in the last four seasons.  We have won more league  titles than any other club in the world. We had  the party and now we  have to deal with the hangover. The schadenfreude  is deserved.<br><br>If  Rangers cannot satisfy the HMRC, they will go  bust. The club would  reform, but they would lose a swathe of support.  Not least because  Rangers&#39; identity is so entwined with the ridiculous  amount of success  they have enjoyed over the past 140 years. The  Rangers community would  be decimated by having those trophies removed  from the records. At a  time when Hearts are on the brink and both Hibs  and Aberdeen are  continually fighting relegation, Celtic will be left  with no one to play  and no TV deal.<br><br>A gridiron metaphor may be  more appropriate when  it comes to Rangers hopes of avoiding  administration. Previous  chairman, Alastair Johnston, has spoken about  the &quot;Monday morning  quarterbacks&quot; who slate him for allowing Whyte to  take over. What  Rangers need now is the long, desperate throw up the  pitch which  characterises the last-ditch attempt of an NFL side to  recover a  seemingly lost game.<br><br>We are blindly hoping Murray will  protect  his reputation with the fans by buying the club back this  week. Hail  Marys have never been so popular down Ibrox way.

This is the Queen&#39;s XI.   Their fans sing Rule Britannia and God Save the Queen &ndash; but they are in   deep trouble, and may well fold completely before it&#39;s time to launch   the Jubilee barge. Football writer and Rangers fan Graham Spiers has   called this the club&#39;s &quot;bitter harvest&quot;, and railed against the club&#39;s   inability to cope with its own sectarian songsheet, which has been the   source of grief and resentment for years.<br><br>But this is a story   about financial stupidity more than cultural insolvency. The emerging   collapse of Rangers football club is an allegory for a different game   that&#39;s not so beautiful anymore, where we can&#39;t run failed institutions   just because it&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done. Rangers may go bust owing the   tax man almost &pound;50m.<br><br>How did this happen? After the loyalty she   has been shown over the years, how can Her Majesty allow her Revenue   &amp; Customs to behave in this manner? The reality dawning on the   Scottish sports press and supporters of Rangers FC (two groups that are   not always entirely distinct) is that the Scottish champions are   perilously close to administration and, potentially, liquidation.<br><br>Rangers   chairman Craig Whyte (himself currently under investigation by the   government&#39;s intelligence and enforcement directorate for his   acquisition of the Ibrox club) said there is no &quot;realistic or practical&quot;   alternative to getting ready for administration. The problem relates  to  a claim by HMRC for unpaid taxes over a period of several years  dating  back to 2001, which could result in massive liabilities.<br><br>The   collapse of such a footballing giant after decades of mismanagement   tells us a story not just about football as a bloated dysfunctional   cultural spectacle, but of feral businessmen, media collusion, and a   society witnessing key institutions collapse and teeter while   desperately denying that such a thing is happening.<br><br>As bitter   reality dawns, other certain truths are clung to amid the wreckage. Two   of these stand out. One is that Craig Whyte is a shrewd guardian with a   secret plan. Rumours swirl that Graeme Souness waits in the wings like  a  moustachioed Sauron. A Blue Knight to replace Craig Whyte. The  second  is that Rangers will emerge from the ordeal stronger, and, er,  leaner.<br><br>Establishment  voices mutter confidently of the club&#39;s  fanbase and that the &quot;&quot;club  will never die&quot;. Such macho posturing is a  default setting from the  club&#39;s supporters (who numbered 17,822 at the  recent home defeat to  Dundee United), but the full extent of the club&#39;s  debts are unknown.  Closely tied to this belief that RFC will re-emerge  is the notion  (repeated like a mantra on all broadcast frequencies)  that &quot;the Scottish  Premiere League without Rangers is unthinkable&quot;, and  &quot;Scottish football  couldn&#39;t survive without the Old Firm&quot;. But this  idea was quashed by  Celtic&#39;s chief executive Peter Lawwell only this  week, when he stated  plainly that his club &quot;don&#39;t need Rangers&quot; to  flourish financially.  Lawwell said the eventuality of their Old Firm  rivals going bust &quot;would  have no material effect on Celtic&quot;.<br><br>The  idea that the two clubs  are mutually dependent persists only because  the idea of Rangers and  Celtic is so deeply embedded not just in  Scottish culture, but also in  Scottish press circulation. The Old Firm  flog papers. But, in reality,  the idea that splitting the Old Firm  would be a travesty for Scottish  football is upheld only by people who  have vested interests in our  (already) hopelessly failing game.  Scotland&#39;s Sky TV deal is already  pitiful, and BBC Scotland&#39;s coverage  is reduced to a poorly produced  highlights package.<br><br>Michael  Grant of the Herald wrote: &quot;Celtic  and Scottish football could live  without Rangers but, boy, it would be  as dull as dishwater.&quot; For the  absent-minded and unobservant, Scottish  football has been in dire  terminal decline for some time now. The idea  that it would be worse in a  league that would immediately present more  opportunities for success  is patently absurd. It&#39;s the sort of logic  that could only be expressed  by members of a closed group.<br><br>Life  After Rangers Football  (Larf) would mean for every other club a chance  that the thousands who  migrate towards Ibrox from towns across Scotland  every other Saturday  might show an interest in their local team. They  would have realistic  hope of winning trophies. But the positive reality  of a Scottish game  without Rangers is not primarily about a sport rid of  a substantial  element of ritualised bigotry and sustained  intergenerational hatred,  but the prospect of top-quality football being  played by young Scotsmen  in an atmosphere of optimism. That&#39;s something  worth aspiring to.<br><br>The  mainstream press have been fatally  blindsided on the impending crisis  at Ibrox despite excellent blog  coverage. But let&#39;s not blame the  clubbable journos. The real culprits  are the management and board of  the club who piled profligacy upon  spending spree, from Dick Advocaat&#39;s  dubious &pound;12m Tore Andre Flo to  David Murray&#39;s gigantic vanity project.  But who&#39;d blame them? Our  culture lauds these dodgy geezers. Murray,  the club&#39;s previous owner,  was quoted as saying: &quot;For every &pound;5 Celtic  spends I&#39;ll spend &pound;10.&quot; That  doesn&#39;t seem so clever now.<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>An Aberdeen fan&#39;s view:</h3> <br> The great &lsquo;Scottish football needs Rangers&rsquo; lie<br>   The only thing that has tainted this truly wonderful day for me has   been the endless steam of pundits and posters all across the media,   patronisingly telling us that we&rsquo;d all suffer without Rangers.<br> <br> Their main arguments seem to be that<br> <br> a ) we need their gate money twice a season<br> b ) no-one will be interested in Scottish Football without them<br> c ) Our co-efficient will be damaged by not having them in Europe<br> d ) Our TV deal will suffer<br> <br> Lets pick these arguments apart one at a time and put this myth to bed once and for all -<br> <br>   a ) Gate Money: Using ourselves as an example, when the scum are in   town we normally get 17k going up to 18-19k if we&rsquo;re playing decent.<br>   Normally we get about 9k going up to 11-12k if we&rsquo;re playing decent.   Now given that if they vanished we&rsquo;d still be playing someone instead of   rangers, we can assume that we would get our average crowd. So right   now with their two &lsquo;visits&rsquo; a year, their existence seems to provide us   with around 16,000 paying customers per season.<br> <br> That&rsquo;s less   that 1000 punters for each home game of the year, or one decent European   night, or our share of a cup semi final. without their cheating,  scummy  presence, the league would only get more competitive, there  would be  more cup finals and european places up for grabs, and  therefore more  european nights in following seasons.<br> <br> Every team in the league would improve their numbers, and to suggest we couldn&rsquo;t make up 16k over a season is ridiculous.<br> <br>   b ) Interest in the Scottish game: This one is brilliant. Sorry, but   there&rsquo;s not exactly a scramble of Japanese Tourists and Brazilian TV   companies tearing the SPL doors down right now is there, so I fail to   see how are global impact could be less significant than it is at   present. In fact, you never know, but a competitive set up where a few   different teams actually win stuff on a regular basis, might actually   cause a little more interest around the world.<br> <br> Also, I know one   particular country where interest in our game is currently at an all   time low. A country that used to love scottish football but that has   been gradually turned off it by the antics of the bigot brothers. A   country that is actually quite important when your measuring levels of   Interest in Scottish football. A country that might actually come back   to the scottish game if it were tighter, fairer, and more competitive.   Yep you&rsquo;ve guessed it, Scotland. Without rangers, we&rsquo;d like our game a   lot more, and that might be just about all the &lsquo;global interest&rsquo; that we   need.<br> <br> c ) The co-efficient. A vastly overblown argument.  Aside  from the fact that they&rsquo;ve hardly been doing our standing in  Europe any  favours at all recently, this is still a non starter. All  reasonably  sized countries in Europe get the chance for 3 &ndash; 4 of their  top clubs to  represent them in some European competition that they will  find  challenging and financially beneficial should they progress in  it. It  never really changes that much, and it never will. Any minor  changes to  our co-efficient only ever seemed to do the job of gifting  both sets of  minks extra Champions League spots, so that they can make  more money and  make the league yet more uncompetitive.<br> <br> d ) TV  money: Why  would fewer people want to watch an open, exciting  competitive league  than the stale predictable, biased drivel we face  now? People might  argue that the tims would win it every year. But I  don&rsquo;t believe it for a  second. &ldquo;two team&rdquo; leagues are quite common  throughout the world. One  team leagues practically non-existent. The  tims didn&rsquo;t win everything  the last time the h*ns were pish, we made  sure of that. A we would  again.<br> <br> The Lie has been told too often, but it&rsquo;s still a lie. Lets start getting the truth heard once in a while.

Not only has this   happened far quicker than anyone anticipated but it transpires that the   fault lies most squarely with current owner Craig Whyte. Perhaps   appropriately for the club that flies more Union Jacks than any other in   Britain, it was Her Majesty&#39;s Revenue and Customs that finally,   conclusively exposed the Rangers chairman as a fly-by-night. Whyte   applied for administration on Monday with a statement claiming Rangers   could never win the case brought against the club for tax evasion by the   previous owner. HMRC, however, went to court on Tuesday solely to  chase  taxes unpaid since Whyte&#39;s takeover in May 2011.<br><br>Such were  the  accelerated claims and counter-claims, some fans felt briefly  relieved  that Rangers were going down this draconian route by their own  hand.  HMRC would, according to Whyte, be owed anything up to &pound;75  million if  they won the large legacy tax case against the club. This  was apparently  driving the authority&#39;s late attempt to control the  administration  process at Ibrox.<br><br>When the court decreed that  Whyte could appoint  the administrators, it made it almost impossible  for the tax  authorities to recoup all they are owed. Entering  administration nine  days earlier than anticipated, and surrendering the  SPL title to Celtic,  seemed worth it.<br><br>HMRC were expected to be  the largest creditor,  so Whyte appeared to have won a courtroom  victory. The threat of  liquidation had abated. However, former Ibrox  chairman Alastair Johnston  immediately contested &ndash; in the court of Sky  Sports News &ndash; Whyte&#39;s  recent assertion that the legacy tax bill could  be more than &pound;49m.<br><br>Late  on Tuesday HMRC confirmed it had acted  that day regarding only a  previously-unpublicised &pound;9m in taxes unpaid  since Whyte took control of  Rangers. Along with the &pound;24m he borrowed on  future season ticket sales,  this means Whyte has created a debt of at  least &pound;33m in just nine  months. Emotional scenes outside Ibrox turned  angry as the chairman was  recast as an asset-stripper.<br><br>SPL rules  state that Rangers will be  deducted ten points. So, although they  remain well ahead of third-place  Motherwell, Celtic have all but won  the title. If Rangers are not out  of administration by the end of March  they will be disqualified from  next season&#39;s European competitions.<br><br>PFA  Scotland have met with  the players. As the most senior figure at Ibrox  they can trust, manager  Ally McCoist is now unimpeachable with the  fans. David Murray has been  the first off-stage character to deny he is  about to buy Rangers back  from Whyte.<br><br>We have seen this week  exactly how much the club is  hated, but also the depth and breadth of  love for it. I blame no one for  wanting Rangers liquidated. Neither do I  blame Murray for our present  state. He tried everything to please a  support seemingly satisfied by  nothing.<br><br>Rangers&#39; commercial  exploitability has been given one  huge cross-platform, multimedia  advert this week.

For 41 years I have been watching this great  football club &ndash; I  suddenly feel middle-aged &ndash; ever since my father  first lifted me over an  Ibrox turnstile sometime during the 1970-71  season. Back then, I now  know, it was the age of innocence. Today, I am  suddenly confronted by a  club in its death-throes.<br><br>I feel like a  ringside witness to the  rise and fall of Rangers over all these years:  first as a fan on the  terracing and then, for the past 20 years, as a  journalist, often  finding myself inside Ibrox speaking to the managers,  players and  chairmen of the club. Along with the Scottish legal system  and the  Church of Scotland, Rangers FC was once described as &ldquo;one of  the three  great pillars of Scottish society&rdquo;. In one sense this seems a  ludicrous  description but, accurate or not, it is a pillar that is now  coming  crashing down.<br><br>It was intoxicating being a Rangers fan  as a kid.  Football fans the world over will tell you something similar:  I can  still feel the pulsing excitement in my veins, just thinking  back to  those Saturday afternoons when the matches loomed. Ibrox back  then was  the classic, oval arena in the British football tradition and  you simply  couldn&rsquo;t wait to feast your eyes on its great edifice.<br><br>Like  many  fathers and sons at the football, my Dad and I stood in the same  spot  week in, week out at Ibrox: two-thirds of the way down the  terracing at  the uncovered Broomloan or &ldquo;away&rdquo; end. From being  initially &ldquo;lifted  over&rdquo;, I would scamper with pulsating excitement  ahead of my parent, up  the vast steps to the top of the arena, then  along maybe 20 yards beside  a wall, to be greeted by the mesmerising  scene before me: the gleaming  pitch, the gathering crowd, plus that  unique &ldquo;football smell&rdquo; of  Woodbines, pies and Bovril. Just writing  this now, I am transported back  to that magical world.<br><br>This was  the early 1970s. Back then  Rangers had a team that, for me, hardly ever  seemed to change, and whose  line-up I can still reel off, like stanzas  from a poem, in that quaint  70s way when football teams were cited in  clusters of threes: &ldquo;McCloy,  Jardine and Mathieson; Greig, Jackson and  Smith; McLean, Conn and Stein;  MacDonald and Johnston&hellip;&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t even  bothered to check this line-up  on Google because I don&rsquo;t need to. That  team, give or take the odd  name-change due to injury, is embedded in my  brain.<br><br>The one game,  until I was 12 or 13, that I was never  taken to was the Old Firm  fixture. &ldquo;Please, Dad, please!&rdquo; I would  implore him from about the age  of eight or nine, but he would hear none  of it. Thus I would be exposed  to the ritual &ndash; and the agony &ndash; of the  famous Grandstand teleprinter as  it clattered away from about 4:45pm on  BBC1 on a Saturday, chattering  out the football scores while you  placed your hands over your eyes.<br><br>I  came from a split  footballing family. My sister was a Celtic supporter  and, invariably,  as I recall it now, Celtic got the better of Rangers,  home or away, in  those early 1970s days. The intonation on Grandstand as  the &ldquo;classified  results&rdquo; were read out was solemn, painful and  recurring. &ldquo;Celtic 2,  Rangers 0&rdquo; or &ldquo;Rangers 1, Celtic 2&rdquo; seemed to be  results arriving with a  painful consistency. My first Old Firm game was  actually in January,  1975, when Rangers, on a ploughed Ibrox pitch,  hammered Celtic by 3-0.  It was a dark, freezing winter&rsquo;s day, but my  euphoria that night was  uncontainable.<br><br>Back then, even as a kid,  you did have a slight  sense of some of the sins of the club. Rangers  supporters had a  problematic reputation, and I was there at Ibrox when  the club&rsquo;s then  general-manager, Willie Waddell, took to the pitch in  the late 1970s to  make a public statement from a podium, in which he  distanced the club  from its erstwhile policy of religious  discrimination.<br><br>My memory  might be deceiving me, but Waddell that  day, I believe, delivered his  statement wearing a Rangers top &ndash; I even  think in a red top, which at  the time was the club&rsquo;s &ldquo;second strip&rdquo;.<br><br>Either  way, as I got  older, I had a dawning sense of what the Scottish  sportswriter Ian  Archer once called Rangers&rsquo; &ldquo;occasional disgrace and  permanent  embarrassment&rdquo;. Even so, it never diminished my appetite for  the club.<br><br>If  you had said to any of us back then that Rangers FC  would die, it  would have seemed a ludicrous, fanciful notion. The club  appeared as  strong and immoveable as the famous red brickwork of the  main Ibrox  facade. Yes, football clubs needed &ldquo;running&rdquo; and  &ldquo;management&rdquo;. But  death? Disappearance? Absolutely no chance. That kind  of thing, surely,  happened to clubs like Bradford Park Avenue or Third  Lanark. Rangers  were the absolute embodiment of British might and  strength. Nothing in  heaven or earth, it was believed, could ever remove  Rangers.<br><br>Four  decades on from those days, these are agonising  times for Rangers  fans. The club has been done-in by reckless  mismanagement, some huge  dollops of arrogance and hubris, and what seems  to have been a wilful  disregard for the laws of the land in terms of  tax-paying. The club is  on its knees, indeed, it might even be in the  process of being lowered  into the grave. The truth is, the mighty  Rangers forget that, either in  love or war, there are both rules and  consequences.<br><br>On a  personal note, I seem to have spent the past  two days hawking myself  from one broadcast studio to another,  metaphorically kicking Sir David  Murray at every turn. It is not a type  of punditry that has sat easily  with me. Murray, principally through his  decision to utilise employee  benefit trusts (EBTs) at the club, has  been the unintending architect  of Rangers&rsquo; ruin. But it is done now.  What is the point, I sometimes  think, in kicking and kicking him?<br><br>Murray  wanted only the very  best for Rangers. He never meant the club any  harm, as weird as that  statement now looks. His ambitions were vast for  the club and, the  truth is, the vast body-politic of the Rangers support  bought into it.  Under Murray, as Rangers made swingeing annual losses  of &pound;29 million  one season and &pound;31m the next, how many of those  supporters who are now  bleating raised their voices in protest at the  time?<br><br>As for  Craig Whyte &hellip; how can I put this safely and  euphemistically? The word  &ldquo;slippery&rdquo; might have been invented for this  shambolic character. In  courts of law in England and Scotland, Whyte has  been panned for some  of his business practices and, inheriting the  Murray mess, he has now  led Rangers into administration and to the point  of extinction. In all  of these dodgy Rangers dealings, I believe taking  the club into  administration has been a part of the Whyte plan all  along.<br><br>Rangers  supporters are rightly angered. It has been a  disgusting betrayal of  the club and its standing in the world of  football. This is no  over-excited newspaper headline: Rangers as we know  it might die in the  coming weeks. In my lifetime, I feel as if I was  there at the  intoxicating beginning, and now at the abject end. When I  take a step  back from it all, it still seems scarcely believable.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Shed tears for taxpayers not Rangers fans</h3>Patrick Barclay Evening Standard (London Paper)<br>15 Feb 2012<br><br><br>Sympathy   for Rangers, a giant brought to its knees, is natural. It is also   utterly misplaced. We should be saving our sobs for the hard-pressed   taxpayer. And, next time we are up in arms over a public expenditure   cut, we would be more justified in marching on Ibrox than Whitehall,   because many millions are likely to be written off.<br><br>Administration   is no fun for any club, and can be a bitter blow to innocent  employees,  but it is still a relatively easy way out for the owners  responsible  and fans who have been only too happy to celebrate the  achievements of  players the club could not afford, as in 2008, when  Harry Redknapp&#39;s  Portsmouth won the FA Cup.<br><br>When Portsmouth went  into  administration, a group of supporters admirably settled debts to   charities, but most go unpaid and taxpayers - including the majority  who  have no interest in football - are often hardest hit. With the  public  purse in crisis, it was reassuring to see the taxman get tough  with  Rangers.<br><br>Let&#39;s hope the authorities are equally rigorous in   dealing with English clubs suspected of paying players through trusts.   There is also the question of fellow clubs. Terry Butcher, the Rangers   legend now managing at Inverness, says they are owed a tidy sum. And   what is the footballing sanction? Ten points. Enough to take Rangers out   of a title race they would probably have lost to Celtic anyway. But   they need have no fear of relegation. Nor that regeneration will prove   as challenging as for, say, Leeds.<br><br>The temptation is always to   find a demon in the boardroom and, in this instance, Craig Whyte has   slipped into the role once filled by Peter Ridsdale at Leeds.<br><br>But   the supporter should not evade a degree of responsibility. The club I   love, Dundee, went into administration twice and were docked 25 points.<br><br>Many   fans moaned - but the public purse lost hundreds of millions. We now   own the club and one day, I hope, we shall pay that money back. We don&#39;t   have to. We should have to.<br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic via Twitter (Tony Hamilton)</h3>16 Feb 2012<br>#Celtic   statement on First Minister&#39;s comments: &quot;We are very disappointed with   the First Minister&#39;s claims that Celtic &quot;need&quot; Rangers and that Celtic   &quot;can&#39;t prosper unless Rangers are there&quot;.<br><br>&quot;This is simply not   true. In a series of interviews given just 3 days ago, we made it   abundantly clear that Celtic has a well defined strategy and a business   plan independent of the fortunes of any other club. That remains   absolutely the case &quot;.<br><br>&quot;The predicament of Rangers is clearly a serious and complex matter with a whole range of possible outcomes.<br><br>&quot;However,   we are extremely well qualified to make our own position clear and  have  no wish to see that being misrepresented for political reasons &quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Stuart Bathgate: No sympathy when the public purse is being short-changed<br></h3>The Scotsman<br><br><br>Published on Friday 17 February 2012 02:39<br><br>Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue &amp; Customs should treat Craig Whyte no differently than any other taxpayer<br><br>IF   you or I fell behind with our taxes, say for a relatively small amount   such as &pound;900, we would get a late-payment penalty and the threat of   further legal action. The First Minister of Scotland would not rush into   a television studio to call on Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue &amp; Customs to   be reasonable and give us more time. The Prime Minister of the United   Kingdom would not declare that the priority was for us to survive and   thrive.<br><br>Both of those politicians, if our minor financial   difficulties came to their notice, would rightly say that the rule of   law is paramount. Times are tight, it is more important than ever that   taxes are paid, our public services need proper funding.<br><br>So why,   when Craig Whyte falls behind with his taxes for a relatively large   amount like &pound;9million, is there such a different reaction? Why has there   been such an outpouring of sympathy, not only from Alex Salmond and   David Cameron, but from a far wider section of society?<br><br>Is there   no room, between that sympathy of a large tranche of public opinion and   the Schadenfreude of those who dislike Rangers, for any other  position?  For example, one that says by all means let&rsquo;s get Rangers  back on their  feet, but not at the expense of the public purse?<br><br>As  politicians,  Salmond and Cameron have an interest in courting positive  publicity.  The former is deeply unpopular with many Rangers fans, the  latter with  just about everyone else in Scotland, so they could do with  a bit of  help. Even so, it has been breathtaking how willingly those  two senior  governing figures have distanced themselves from the arm of  government,  HMRC, which is there to fund their plans, build our schools  and keep our  hospitals open.<br><br>Salmond has tried to present  himself as an  honest broker, calling for the Revenue and Rangers to  play softball  together. Speaking on the BBC&rsquo;s Reporting Scotland on  Wednesday evening  he said: &ldquo;The most important thing is to get a  sensible agreement  between Rangers and HMRC in terms of the extent of  what&rsquo;s owed and how  that can be paid off.<br><br>&ldquo;The most important  thing is that Rangers  are able to continue as a football club. That&rsquo;s  the absolutely critical  matter. I think if we keep our eyes on what&rsquo;s  best for Rangers as a  club, as an institution, for other clubs in  Scotland, for Scottish  football, then that would be a sensible thing to  do.&rdquo;<br><br>What&rsquo;s best  for Rangers as an institution? What does that  badly overused word have  to do with anything? Next time the Revenue are  on your case, tell them  you&rsquo;re an institution and see how far that  gets you.<br><br>Cameron, to  give him his due, retained a little more  distance, albeit while  expressing the same misplaced sentiments. &ldquo;I  want that club to survive  and to thrive,&rdquo; he said on his visit to  Scotland yesterday. &ldquo;It has an  extraordinary history. It has a very  special place in many people&rsquo;s  hearts in Scotland and no-one wants to  see that club disappear. So I  hope that HMRC will work as closely as  they can with the administrators  to try to solve the problems, to try  to resolve the issues.&rdquo;<br><br>That  last phrase is suitably vague:  resolving the issues. If it means  securing the future of the people who  work at Ibrox, most of us would be  with him there. If it means letting  Whyte off lightly, we would beg to  differ.<br><br>Because there is a  position between sympathy and  Schadenfreude. One which, after a couple  of days of near silence, is  beginning to find its voice. And it&rsquo;s an  increasingly angry voice.<br><br>There  is an e-petition on the official  British government website, for  example, called &ldquo;Rangers. Pay your  taxes.&rdquo; It can be read, signed or  commented on by clicking here.<br><br>It  mentions the pending tax case  which could cost the Ibrox club around  &pound;50m in addition to the &pound;9m in  VAT and PAYE which Whyte has not paid,  and concludes: &ldquo;Rangers FC and  their owners need to pay their dues, pay  their taxes and take the full  punishment that is imposed on them.&rdquo;<br><br>And  on the Hearts  supporters&rsquo; chatroom, Jambos Kickback, one poster  writes: &ldquo;[Salmond]  said his priority is ensuring Rangers survive. As  First Minister, his  priority should be what is best for the Scottish  taxpayer and if that is  the closing down of Rangers then that is what  he should call for.<br><br>&ldquo;I  do not think those who are struggling,  [have] seen their businesses  close or have been pursued vigorously for  tax due, would appreciate any  let-off or a laidback attitude.&rdquo;<br><br>It  is debatable whether the  closing-down of Rangers would benefit the  taxpayer, but the principle  stands. There is no reason why Whyte should  be given an easier time than  any other individual who is late in  paying tax. Indeed, given the size  of the sum he has failed to pay, he  should be pursued with even greater  vigour than anyone whose  misdemeanour may amount to a few hundred  pounds.<br><br>That is  something we should all be able to agree on  whether we support Rangers,  loathe them or have no interest in football.  We could do a lot with  that &pound;9m: build more facilities for health or  education, fund more  anti-crime initiatives, or simply succeed in  delaying a few of the cuts  that are being implemented by the UK  government. Craig Whyte should be  held liable for every last penny of  it.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>    Glenn Gibbons: Pride and profligacy a prelude to Rangers&rsquo; fall</h3>By GLENN GIBBONS<br>Published on Saturday 18 February 2012 00:00<br><br>RANGERS&rsquo;   descent into administration was no more surprising than a hurricane in   the Caribbean (if potentially just as damaging), but the islanders  tend  to be better prepared than the great majority of those with an   allegiance to Ibrox.<br><br>Considering the attention given in recent   years to the financial devastation wreaked by the former owner/chairman,   David Murray &ndash; this was long before the conferral of a knighthood &ndash; it   seems almost perverse that the event should register as a shock, the   collective wailing and lamentation disproportionate to the expectations   of less partial commentators.<br><br>As with the rise of Nazism and   fascism in between-the-wars Germany and Italy respectively, the most   pressing question asked in retrospect has been: how could it have been   allowed to happen? In the 1930s, it was concluded that entire   populations were duped because Hitler built the autobahns and presided   over the introduction of the Volkswagen Beetle, while Mussolini made the   trains run on time.<br><br>Sixty years on, it was not difficult for  any  non-aligned observers to see that, in truth, Murray&rsquo;s pot-hunting   bluster and bravado appealed to Rangers supporters&rsquo; innate taste for   triumphalism. This is a remark that will doubtless raise hackles and   cause veins to pop on fevered brows, but it is a trait that becomes   evident too regularly to be dismissed as insignificant.<br><br>Even the   most successful managers at Ibrox have had to tolerate booing of their   team for committing the capital offence of being a goal down at   half-time, long before a match is completed. Underlining the hunger for   success at any price (the result emphatically more important than the   performance) is the peculiar phenomenon of reserving the most intense   celebration for the least impressive of victories over the most moderate   of opponents. Sown on such fertile ground, it is hardly surprising  that  the seeds of assumption and complacency should thrive.<br><br>Rangers   followers&rsquo; claim to being &ldquo;the greatest fans in the world&rdquo; is as  hollow  as that made by supporters of clubs all over the planet  (including  Celtic). It is so much juvenile pap because, like the  greatest movie  ever made, the world&rsquo;s greatest fans do not exist.<br><br>If  anything,  those who claim unswerving loyalty to Rangers have been  distinguished  over the decades by a tendency to thin out in the face of  adversity. It  is a mere two weeks since fewer than 18,000 fans  (including around 1,600  visitors) attended a Scottish Cup tie, while a  random glance at matches  in the early 1980s, when lying third in the  league, reveals crowds of  4,500 and 8,500 for successive home matches  against St Mirren and  Dundee.<br><br>Those hard times would undoubtedly  deepen the joy of the  1990s, the support understandably too consumed  by their own elation to  give any credence even to the possibility that  the orgiastic indulgence  was unsustainable and would one day exact a  toll.<br><br>When Murray  made his now infamous boast of putting down a  tenner for every fiver  spent by Celtic, the Rangers fans were too busy  gloating (a natural and  forgivable reaction) to see the true  significance of the bombast. It was  not simply that the principle was  basically unsound but that it  symbolised Rangers&rsquo; suicidal readiness to  pay a transfer fee that was  double a player&rsquo;s worth.<br><br>This  peculiar &ndash; some would say insane &ndash;  commercial practice was never more  convincingly exposed than by the  Gordan Petric business in 1995. The  story is the more authentic for  having been told to me by Fergus  McCann, the Celtic owner/managing  director at the very heart of the  affair.<br><br>The late Tommy Burns,  then manager at Parkhead,  approached McCann and said he would like to  sign Petric, the Serbian  central defender, from Dundee United. Complying  with the usual drill in  these matters, McCann asked the manager how  much he thought Petric was  worth.<br><br>&ldquo;Tommy told me &pound;800,000,&rdquo; the  little Scots-Canadian  recalled later. &ldquo;So the board approved the  approach. Tommy came back  and told me Rangers had got wind of it and had  offered &pound;900,000. I went  back to the board and got permission to up the  offer to one million.  Tommy came back again and said Rangers had bid  &pound;1.1 million. This  continued until we went to 1.4 and Rangers once again  topped it by  &pound;100,000.<br><br>&ldquo;At that point, I said, &lsquo;Tommy, enough.  You are now  asking me to offer &pound;1.6 million for a player you told me was  worth  precisely half of that just a short while ago. No, thanks.  Rangers can  have him&rdquo;. In the event, Petric&rsquo;s generally unremarkable  performances  in his three years at Ibrox rather vindicated Burns&rsquo;s  original  evaluation, but, in the context of Rangers&rsquo; present  predicament, the  episode becomes a beacon of enlightenment.<br><br>But  no warning could  have been more stark than the words uttered by the  former Rangers  director, Hugh Adam, and reproduced in the sports pages  of The Scotsman  just a few days more than ten years ago, on 2 February,  2002.<br><br>In  a piece almost spookily headlined &ldquo;Adam Shakes Ibrox  Pillars With  Warning Of Bankruptcy&rdquo;, the then 76-year-old board member  first  revealed that he had, just before, sold the remaining 47,000  shares of  his original 59,000 holding for no other reason than his  conviction  that, having lost two-thirds of their value in the previous  three years  &ndash; from &pound;3.45 to &pound;1.15 &ndash; they were heading towards  worthlessness.<br><br>He  predicted bankruptcy because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the  logical conclusion to a  strategy that incurs serious loss year on year.&rdquo;  As recently as two  weeks ago, Rangers-supporting posters on internet  threads were still  disdaining Adam as some kind of ill-informed  eccentric.

Photograph:  Andrew Milligan/PA<br>&quot;It does not require a majority to  prevail, but  rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires  in people&#39;s  minds&quot; &ndash; Samuel Adams, 1775<br><br>It is easy to feel  powerless in this  world. &quot;Why bother? What can I do?&quot; Even as a  student, I did not join  protest marches. While most of my generation  screamed: &quot;Can&#39;t pay! won&#39;t  pay!&quot; about the hated poll tax, I could and  I did. Raging against the  machine seemed like Sisyphean futility and  talk of changing the world  was for poets and artists. To me, practical  people just got on with it  and made the best of events. Cynicism was a  uniform I wore with pride.  Against such a background, I make an  unlikely campaigner and the last  person anyone would pick to give voice  to a silenced and disenfranchised  community.<br><br>Yet my blog,  rangerstaxcase.com, seems to have done  exactly that. What started as an  impulse one Sunday evening in March of  last year has grown into  something of a Scottish cultural phenomenon.  Love it or loathe it, few  would dispute that this blog has played a  significant role revealing  the facts and shaping the debate on a subject  that has taken on such  importance that the UK prime minister and  Scottish first minister have  belatedly jumped on the bandwagon.<br><br>This  monster has grown to the  point where it is now fielding daily traffic  of over 100,000 views,  while new arguments and ideas are fuelled by  reader comments that are  now coming in at a rate of about 1,500 per day.  These are odd  statistics for discussions characterised by accounting  conventions and  insolvency law. It is as if all of the cool kids in the  playground  suddenly want to read the swots&#39; algebra homework.<br><br>In a  world of  free information, where most blogs die alone and ignored  shortly after  birth, the very popularity of rangerstaxcase.com carries a  message  about modern Scotland. It is a story of the unmet need for the  straight  story, uncorrupted by the sinister Triangle of Trade that  renders most  of what passes as news in Scotland&#39;s media outlets as  worthless. It is  the tale of why things went so wrong at Rangers and why  the club&#39;s  many fans seemed paralysed by disbelief until it was too  late.<br><br>If  you have not spent much time in Caledonia what follows  will seem a  little surreal. It seems that way because it is. Scotland is  a land  where nothing matters like football matters &ndash; in particular  within the  west-central region. For over 120 years, Glasgow&#39;s two  biggest football  teams have engaged in one of the world&#39;s most bitter  sporting feuds.  With mindless tribalism masquerading as a religious  divide, stabbings,  live bombs sent through the post, and even murders  have been woven into  the tapestry of the recent history of Scottish  football. Yet I still  get challenged over my penchant for anonymity?  Football in Scotland is  not like football elsewhere - at least not in  Europe. (Latin Americans  might recognise the poison brought to the  surface by the poultice of  football, but few other places would  understand).<br><br>Yet for all of  its ugliness, I love it. A large part  of my &quot;two score and change&quot;  years on this planet has been devoted to  supporting my team, Celtic.  Actually watching the team would be a very  small part of the time  expended. The obsession with your team colours  many other aspects of  life for those unfortunates who find themselves  pulled into the vortex  that goes along with supporting either of the  Glasgow giants.<br><br>Football  clubs from places like Manchester and  Liverpool can lay claim to much  more success on the field, but these  cities do not get close to Glasgow  in terms of intensity of interest. It  is this passion that serves as  the growth medium for the bacillus that  infects the news business in  Scotland, which in turn serves as the  carrier of the disease that  threatens to kill Rangers.<br><br>Selling  news of any kind in Glasgow  has long been a simple business: sales are  driven by stories about  Rangers and Celtic. If you need a circulation  boost to improve  advertising rates, you need more and better stories  about these  football teams. Good news moves newsprint. Bad news sells,  too, as fans  wallow in the misery of their hated enemy. However,  Scotland is not  evenly divided between these clubs. Celtic and Rangers  may attract  similar attendances to home games, but the demographic  reality is that  there are a great many more people in Scotland who would  claim to be  Rangers supporters than Celtic. Religious census figures  provide a  decent proxy for the numbers that sustain both clubs: in 2001,  less  than 18% of the population of Scotland identified as being Roman   Catholic. Celtic&#39;s support base is far from exclusively Catholic, but it   would be a little daft to ignore the reality of family religious  origin  in determining which football team a young boy or girl is most  likely  to follow in Scotland. Rangers&#39; demographic surplus has  determined the  general editorial tone of the nation&#39;s news business for  decades.<br><br>During  the early 1990s when Celtic had their own brush  with financial  mortality, newspapers sent journalists across the globe  to chase down  scandal related to Celtic&#39;s imminent demise. Such was  the open glee in  print, it is a wonder that the English language had to  import the word  Schadenfreude from German. The lowland Scots dialect  would surely have  had several words of its own to offer, but I doubt  that the acronym  GIRUY would have translated as readily across the  globe. Celtic&#39;s  travails were good for the media business. There was no  shortage of  Rangers supporters willing to smirk at their impoverished  foes while  dreaming of European Cup triumphs to come. The arrival of  Celtic&#39;s  saviour from Canada, the unfashionable Fergus McCann, ended  the era of  amateurism in the boardroom and also planted the seeds for  the great  divergence in the fortunes of the clubs. Few could have  imagined how  much could change in just two decades.<br><br>The story of  Rangers&#39;  insolvency is already becoming a fireside tale told mostly by  those who  were not there. Trampled down in the rush of journalists  claiming that  &quot;of course, I knew all along, but I just could not say  anything&quot; are all  of the derisive newspaper articles and radio call-in  panellists  dismissing the risks Rangers were facing. I am in no doubt:  Scotland&#39;s  media, sports and business desks alike, are complicit in the  disaster  than has befallen Rangers. They killed their golden goose.<br><br>The   Triangle of Trade to which I have referred is essentially an  arrangement  where Rangers FC and their owner provide each journalist  who is &quot;inside  the tent&quot; with a sufficient supply of transfer  &quot;exclusives&quot; and player  trivia to ensure that the hack does not have to  work hard. Any Scottish  journalist wishing to have a long career  learns quickly not to bite the  hands that feed. The rule that  &quot;demographics dictate editorial&quot; applied  regardless of original  footballing sympathies.<br><br>The last vertex of  this triangle is the  reader &ndash; the average football fan. Fed a diet rich  in sycophantic  rubbish, he lost the ability to review critically what  he was reading.  Super-casino developments worth &pound;700m complete with  hover-pitches were  still being touted to Rangers fans even after the  first news of the tax  case broke. Along with &quot;Ronaldo To Sign For  Rangers&quot; nonsense, it is  little wonder that the majority of the club&#39;s  fans were in a state of  stupefaction in recent years. They were misled  by those who ran their  club. They were deceived by a media pack that had  to know that the  stories it peddled were false.<br><br>In the end,  Rangers fans sat back  for years and barely raised a word of complaint as  their club was  abused and misused. Many of these same fans who sat on  their hands have  had plenty to say about the motivations of my blog.  Egged on by  spokesmen for those doing Rangers the most harm, it is  widely believed  that HMRC are feeding me information to do damage to  their club.  Firstly, anyone reading the blog again would see that my  sources of  information probably lie outside of the government. Secondly,  the blog  has been the only dependable source of information about the  sorry  state of affairs within Ibrox. By revealing what has been  happening at  Ibrox, I have provided Rangers fans with an opportunity to  do something  about it. If I was really intent on harming their club, I  would have  said nothing at all. That this opportunity has been  squandered is  something for Rangers fans to contemplate. It is in  helping expose this  Bermuda-triangle-for-truth that I take most pride.<br><br>Rangerstaxcase.com   has become a platform for some of the sharpest minds and most   accomplished professionals to share information, debate, and form   opinions based upon a rational interpretation of the facts rather than   PR-firm fabrications. In all of the years when the mainstream media had a   monopoly on opinion forming and agenda setting, the more sentient   football fan had no outlet for his or her opinions. Blogs and other   modern media, like Twitter, have democratised information distribution.   Rangerstaxcase.com has gone far beyond its half-baked &quot;I know a secret&quot;   origins to become a forum for citizen journalism. The power of the   crowd‑sourced investigation initiated by anyone who is able to ignite   the interest of others is a force that has the potential to move   mountains in our society.
