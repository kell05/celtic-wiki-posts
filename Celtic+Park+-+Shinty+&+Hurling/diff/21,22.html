Popular in the Highland areas, it&#39;s got scant attention in the Lowlands of Scotland. You&#39;ll more likely find that if any Celtic fans play or follow a version of the game it is more likely by the Hurling rules than the Shinty game. <br><br>In any case, there are admirers of the game in the Celtic support, and the club has had the great proud note that Celtic Park played host to the very first composite rules of Shinty/Hurling in Scotland (see below). Another notch on the Celtic post for promoting cross-cultural ties between the Celtic nations.<br><br>Additionally of note, there is a famous <span class="diffRemove">&quot;Celtic&quot;</span><span class="diffAdd">&#39;</span><i><span class="diffAdd">Celtic&#39;</span></i> in <span class="diffRemove">shinty,</span><span class="diffAdd">shinty:</span> <i>&#39;Oban Celtic</i>&#39;. Apparently, their name came about by chance. The name was decided upon by the mere toss of coin, the other option being Rangers. It is noted by the rest of us that most Oban Celtic players actually supported the old Rangers FC (now dead). The club had sometimes played in green and white hoops, but this has not been the practice for a few years, and their main strip is <span class="diffAdd">currently </span>Green &amp; White stripes.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>1897 match<img align="right" alt="Shinty - Pic" height="274" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/ZyKFCjDCI0fqgmPddEIGEw761936/GW365H274" title="Shinty - Pic" width="365"></h3>Celtic Park hosted the first ever Composite rules Shinty/Hurling match held in Scotland in 1897, this was between Glasgow Cowal and Dublin Celtic.<br><br><i>(match report)</i><br>In Ireland, in May 1897, it was reported that &quot;<i>the final preparations</i>&quot;  for a fixture between Dublin Celtic and Glasgow Cowal in Glasgow were  complete.

Mar thiodhlag, thug e an g&egrave;am  camanachd do mhuinntir na h-Alba. </i><br><br> 			Way back in the mists of time, a hero came to  Scotland from Ireland. With three massive steps, he came bounding over  from the green swards of the Emerald Isle to the Isle of Skye. Hanging  off his thighs and travelling with him were 80 other people: 80 more on  each arm; nine more spinning in his hair. He came to Scotland to compete  his education as a fosterling with the Warrior Queen Sgathach; to learn  to battle and love. As a gift in return, he gave the game of shinty to  Scotland.<br><br>The common heritage &ndash; the mythical part at any rate - of shinty  and hurling can be traced back 2,000 years. The parting of the ways came  much more recently when both were formally codified. The establishment  of shinty&#39;s ruling body the Camanachd Association (1893) and the Gaelic  Athletic Association in Ireland (1884) should be seen in the context of  prevailing conditions in two quite separate and distinct environments.<br><br> 			In Ireland, the great mass of the people had been demoralised  throughout the years of colonialism and particularly as a consequence of  the Great Famine of the 19th century. The Famine had destroyed  everything and hurling suffered a disastrous decline in the decades  following Irish famines of the late 1840s.<br><br> 			In Scotland the impact of the Clearances was severe also, but  remarkably, towards the end of the century, there was an element of  cross-fertilisation between the two stick codes. A frenetic rash of  activity culminated in the first ever shinty/hurling &ldquo;international in  Glasgow in 1897.<br><br> 			That this event ever took place was due in no small part top two  key people, John Murdoch in Scotland and Michael Cusack in Ireland, both  of whom were involved with newspapers, the Highlander in Scotland and  The Celtic Times which was a unique venture in Irish sporting  journalism, running for the whole of the year 1887.<br><br> 			In that year Cusack donated the Celtic Times Challenge Cup for an  annual hurling versus shinty game which is understood to have taken  place intermittently in Dublin at least up to 1919.<br><br>There was clearly some engagement between Scots and Irish in various  places in the 1880s but the real resumption of links between Ireland and  Scotland towards the end of the 19th century seems to have come about  in the aftermath of the formation of the Camanachd Association in 1893.  The impetus as far as shinty was concerned came from the cities of  Glasgow and London.<br><br> 			On Boxing Day in 1896 at Lea Bridge in London, the most attractive  event of the day was a hurling match between a team selected by the  County Board and a team from the London Scottish Camanachd Club which  lay some claim to &quot;international&quot; status, ending up Ireland 3; Scotland  0.<br><br>This was the forerunner of the great event.<br><br> 			In Ireland, in May 1897, it was reported that &quot;the final  preparations&quot; for a fixture between Dublin Celtic and Glasgow Cowal in  Glasgow were complete. Rules were set and colours chosen for a match  reported as &quot;the first between Irish hurlers and Scottish shinty men on  Scottish soil&quot;. The Celtics left Dublin on Friday evening by the Dublin  Life Boat.<br><br> 			This game, which was being looked forward to with much interest by  Highlanders in Glasgow, took place on the Saturday afternoon at  Parkhead, by kind permission of the Celtic Football Club. &quot;Each  combination wielded sticks peculiar to their respective countries. Those  of the Irishmen resembling elongated bats. A number of the Irishmen  played in their bare feet. Mr. MacFarlane, Oban, ex-president of the  Scottish Shinty Association acted as a referee. There was a big crowd of  spectators, amongst whom were many well-known Highlanders!&quot;<br><br> 			The Scots made a stunning start to the game and led 8-0 at the  interval, with David Chisholm scoring seven of them. A larger size of  ball, and one similar to that usually played with in hurling games, was  brought out in the second period, and the advantage to the Irishmen was  immediately evident. They had, however, to concede defeat in the end by  11 goals to 2.<br><br> 			At the close three cheers were raised by the defeated team for the  victors, and were returned by the victors for the losers. The teams and  officials of the clubs were afterwards photographed. After the match  the members of the Dublin team were entertained to dinner by the Cowal  men.<br><br> 			It was immediately reported that a return match was to be played  in Dublin on Glasgow Fair Saturday, July 17. This was played in Dublin  as scheduled, in front of a poor attendance in &quot;oppressive weather&quot; at  the City ground on Suburban Road, Jones Road. The Irish were said to  have &quot;made a fair show against the Glasgow men considering the fact that  they had never before tried their luck at the game&quot;.<br><br> 			The referee was none other than Michael Cusack and Cowal again won, by a reduced margin of two goals to nil.<br><br> 			The difference in the scale of Scotland&#39;s victory between the two  games has been a mystery which can now be clarified. As the second game  was fixed for the Glasgow Fair Holiday, six key Cowal players decided  that they would head for Argyll rather than Dublin!<br><br> 			The match was also to be played 15-a-side instead of 12 as in  Glasgow, due to the bigger pitch. All this taxed Cowal&#39;s resources. The  match was reported as one of the most exciting games of shinty or  hurling that has ever been seen in Dublin.<br><br> 			The irony was that it was to be another 27 years &ndash; in 1924 -  before a great game would be played between Irish and Scottish hurlers  on Irish soil. By then Ireland itself, never mind camanachd, would be  very different.<br><br> 			Thankfully the links established in the 1880s have survived and  Ireland now meet Scotland in international challenge matches at a number  of levels, including a women&#39;s match. One wonders what the great hero  himself and the Warrior Queen Sgathach would have thought of it all.<i><br><br></i><i>Written by: Hugh Dan MacLennan</i> 			<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>1913 match</h3>Scotland  and Ireland clashed at Celtic Park on June 21st 1913 in a  match  organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).

At the turn of the century this was already a thriving organisation in Scotland with seventeen branches in the Glasgow district as well as in Paisley, Blantyre, Motherwell, Hamilton, Wishaw, Coatbridge, Carfin, Renton, Kilsyth, Barrhead, Denny, Johnstone, Dumbarton, Ayr, Port Glasgow and Greenock.<br><br>As G.A.A. clubs emerged in Scotland hurling, as opposed to Gaelic football, dominated. Although players with no hurling background played the game, at the time there were also a number of skilled hurlers involved. This is clear from contemporary reports. Indeed, a recognition of the skills of the ex-patriot hurlers in Scotland came in 1913 when Glasgow played host to the previous winners of a number of All-Ireland Hurling titles, Kilkenny. The match took place at Celtic&rsquo;s stadium in front of a crowd of five thousand people and the Scottish representatives were beaten by a score of ten goals and five points to four goals and two points.<br><br>This game was viewed as having the potential to promote the sport amongst the Irish in Scotland but its prospects were hampered when the occasion met with competition. On the same day, at Coatbridge in Lanarkshire, the annual demonstration of the Irish National Forresters took place. This friendly society, which also incorporated nationalist and Irish cultural identities, contained branches all over the west central belt in which many Catholic families had members attached. Many thousands of Irish Catholics attended this particular demonstration.</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a class="external" href="http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//BHC_RTV/1924/05/16/BGT407090418/?s=ireland" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ITN: Scotland v Ireland at Shinty 1924  						 						 						 					</a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>OLD IRELAND&#39;S PRIDE<br></h3>(from GAA News 3 Aug 2012, see: http://www.gaa.ie/gaa-news-and-videos/daily-news/2/0208121423-sideline-snippets-week-10/)<br><br>The current Kilkenny team are widely regarded as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, hurling team of all time.<br><br>But from 1907 to 1913, the Cats also had an all-conquering team which won five All-Ireland titles in that period, including three in a row from 1911-1913.<br><br>So dominant was that team, that they were chosen to represent Ireland in a hurling international against Scotland at Celtic Park in 1913, as this picture shows.<br><br>The &#39;Kilkenny&#39; insignia can clearly be seen on the players&#39; jerseys as they pose with their hurls. The inscription below the photograph reads as follows:<br><br>&quot;Today, Saturday June 21st, a great international hurling match, Ireland v. Scotland, takes place at Celtic Park, Parkhead. The Scottish side will consist of Irish exiles chosen from the leading hurling clubs of Glasgow, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire.<br><br>&quot;Ireland will be worthily represented by the Kilkenny team, All-Ireland champions. Hurling, or caman, is of course, the immemorial national pastime of Ireland, dating back to the legendary days of Finn McCool. Before the game, the picturesque parade takes place, the teams in military style marching round the field to the stirring strain of an Irish war-pipe band.&quot;<br><br>The headline on the picture reads: &quot;OLD IRELAND&#39;S PRIDE - KILKENNY CHAMPIONS HURLERS IN GLASGOW&quot;<br><br>As Kilkenny now find themselves back in the All-Ireland semi-final, and chasing a sixth All-Ireland title in seven years, it appears that little has changed in 100 years when it comes to hurling dominance.  <br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Celtic Park - Shinty & Hurling - The Celtic Wiki" height="601" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/CQXVsskpQgNNUgJlnUoIvg108434/GW680H601" title="Celtic Park - Shinty & Hurling - The Celtic Wiki" width="680"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Celtic Park - Shinty & Hurling - Pic" height="606" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/_6__r3vcnCelJEX4MZ8bPA127453/GW462H606" title="Celtic Park - Shinty & Hurling - Pic" width="462"><br><br><br><div align="left">A think the game below is referring to is Mitchell St George&#39;s (Birmingham).
