Brave, athletic and a superb shot stopper, Packie was to become a mainstay of the Celtic team throughout the 1980s and the early years of the 90s. Notably he was Jock Stein&#39;s last signing for the club.<br><br>His big break came in August 1980 when the popular Celtic &#39;keeper Peter Latchford injured his hand and Bonner was thrown in at the deep end for Danny McGrain&#39;s testimonial game against Manchester United at Parkhead. He gave an excellent performance in a 0-0 draw and from that day onwards he was to be the established Celtic number one.<br><br>He won a league medal in 1980/81 despite a rocky spell in November of 1980 when Celtic manager Billy McNeill kept faith with his Irish keeper and he made his debut for the Republic of Ireland in April 1981. Despite his youth he showed a great maturity in his performances and had a fine relationship with his back four of that time - McGrain, Aitken, McAdam and Reid.<br><br>In 1982 Celtic regained the title and Pat&#39;s reputation continued to grow. Around this time he gave great performances in the away Euro ties against Juventus and Ajax. He was sensational in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam when Celtic triumphed 2-1 over Cruyff&#39;s Ajax and it was, arguably, his finest game for Celtic.<br><br>Throughout the 1980&#39;s Celtic&#39;s defence was constantly criticised as Celtic struggled to find a commanding centre half. The attacking philosophy of the club often meant that the defence was given little or no consideration. Pat Bonner won his first Scottish cup medal in 1985 with the late, dramatic win over Dundee United and another league medal in 1986. However the advent of Graeme Souness&#39; Rangers team set Celtic back but they retaliated by winning the double in 1988 with new defenders Mick McCarthy and Chris Morris at last helping to bolster the over worked Celtic defence. Unfortunately Pat Bonner spent long periods on the sidelines that season and young Northern Irishman, Allen McKnight, was in the Celtic goal for the 1988 final victory, again against Dundee United.<br><br>Injury again affected Pat Bonner after a magnificent showing in the 1988 Euro championships in Gemany for Ireland. He had an especially fine game against England in Ireland&#39;s 1-0 win when he defied the much vaunted England forward line of Lineker, Barnes and Beardsley. Despite signing goalkeepers Ian Andrews and Alan Rough, Pat Bonner was back as Celtic goalkeeper by the end of October 1988, having a great performance in the 2-0 win over Hearts.<br><br>Despite Celtic&#39;s deteriorating results at this period Pat Bonner&#39;s performances remained remarkably consistent. He was regarded as one of the world&#39;s best goalkeepers after his magnificent showing for Ireland in the 1990 world cup. He became a national hero when he saved crucial penalties in the shoot out victory against Rumania and Ireland were unlucky to lose to Italy in the quarter finals. On this visit to Italy, Pat Bonner was photographed in the Vatican whilst being introduced to His Holiness, Pope John Paul II. The Pope recognised Pat Bonner - &#39;You are the goalkeeper&#39;, which pleased Pat Bonner as the he was a devout Catholic and the Pope himself was a former goalkeeper in his day.<br><br>One curious impact that Bonner had was to prove to the authorities that a tinkering of the rules was needed, which introduced the pass-back rule. Mulled for a long time before, defensive minded coaches had finally pushed pass-backs to the goalkeeper to the limit, and Ireland were deft exponents of this tactic, with a match v Egypt ending 0-0 and boring the pants off of everyone. So Bonner helped to change the game unwittingly, and at the time it was a major change in a game which has generally been very conservative when it came to rule changes to the game.<br><br>In September 1990 he had the game of his life at Ibrox and inspired Celtic to a credible 1-1 draw. However things were not so good at Parkhead and Liam Brady replaced Billy McNeill as manager in 1991. Brady brought Gordon Marshall from Falkirk and for the first time Pat Bonner now had real competition for the number one jersey. In November 1991 Pat Bonner blundered against Motherwell and Marshall replaced him for the rest of the season.<br><br>In May 1991 Pat Bonner was given a testimonial against a Republic of Ireland select and a huge crowd turned out to see Celtic win 3-2 courtesy of a Gerry Creaney hat trick. At the end of the game the Celtic DJ played &#39;It&#39;s a great day for the Irish&#39; by Glen Daly which was especially fitting given the occasion.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s results did not improve and Lou Macari took over from Brady in 1993 and brought Carl Muggleton as his first choice keeper. Despite this Pat Bonner won back his place and had a fine game at Ibrox in April 1994 when Celtic fought for a draw in a game that saw no Celtic fans allowed into Ibrox stadium. The big Donegal keeper was again at the fore for Ireland in the 1994 world cup in the USA when he inspired Ireland to that famous win over Italy in the sweltering heat of New York.<br><br>He was actually axed by<font color="#333333"> <a href="/page/Macari%2C+Lou" target="_self">Lou Macari</a></font> in 1994, who brusquely informed him that he was being released after the Aberdeen game on 17 May 1994. Pat Bonner then went to the World Cup as a free agent, and went on to agree to join his great friend Tommy Burns at Kilmarnock. When Burns got the Celtic job he brought Bonner back as player/coach.<br><br>Despite his friendship with Burns it was Gordon Marshall who was picked as the Celtic goalie for the new season. Sadly for Marshall, he was deemed at fault by various sections of the support for a late goal in Celtic&#39;s dreadful Coca-Cola cup final defeat to Raith Rovers in November 1994, and thereafter Pat Bonner again returned in the Celtic goal. He had another fine game at Ibrox in January 1995 in a 1-1 draw when a young Celtic outfield team got a result against the odds. He was an elder statesman of the side, and it was buying time till the inevitable end.<br><br>In May 1995 Pat Bonner played his last game for Celtic in the 1-0 Scottish Cup final win over Airdrie. It was a fitting way for the big gentle giant to end his Celtic days and the fans gave him a rapturous ovation as he lifted the cup. All in all, he had been Celtic&#39;s goalkeeper for the best part of 15 years and it was an emotional day for him at Hampden.<br><h3>  </h3><br>The main weaknesses to Bonner&rsquo;s game were the odd handling error and the tendency on occasion to flap at corners and crossballs. The pass-back rule change in 1992 seemed to be a struggle for him at first and knocked his confidence. On the whole though the man from Donegal was a superb servant to the Hoops and it says much about his ability that Celtic struggled for years to find a keeper of equal class to replace him. <br><br>With an incredible 641 appearances to his name it was always guaranteed that the name Packie Bonner would be fondly remembered by Celtic followers. <br><br>Few players have enjoyed a better relationship with the Celtic faithful than Pat Bonner.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic<br></b>After his 1997 departure from the club Packie became involved in coaching and after a spell as <a href="/page/Burns%2C+Tommy" target="_self">Tommy Burns</a>&#39; assistant at Reading, he was part of the Republic coaching team that travelled to the World Cup in 2002.<br><br>Just after leaving Celtic, he knocked back the chance to play for Berwick Rangers <i>against </i>Celtic in the <a href="/page/1997-08-09%3A+Berwick+Rangers+0-7+Celtic%2C+2nd+Rd+League+Cup" target="_self">League Cup</a>. He then linked up with <a href="/page/Stark%2C+Billy" target="_self">Billy Stark</a> for a coaching stint at Greenock Morton in October 1997, before heading to Reading in May 1998.<br><br>In time he moved into media and backroom football work. A popular figure, he was intelligent and well spoken on his commentary on the game, and was well respected. <br><br>Over the fifty years after WW2, Celtic weren&#39;t as blessed with many great keepers for some reason as it was in the previous fifty years or so. There had been plenty of good keepers in that time but few who could be regarded as having been truly great.

Ireland scored two goals in that magical summer, both of which  originated from one of Packie&#39;s aerial bombs. Indeed, in both cases, he  was the last Irish player to touch the ball in the move other than the  goalscorer. So in that sense it was entirely logical that Ireland should  feed their most creative player at every opportunity.<br><br> In his book &#39;The Outsider&#39;, football writer Jonathan Wilson  specifically cited the Ireland-Egypt game as a match which highlighted  the need for change in bright neon lettering.<br><br> Even in Ireland, the match is frequently touted as the worst game in  World Cup history, largely thanks to the efforts of Eamon Dunphy. But  who knew that the game would prove so instrumental in forcing the FIFA  suits to recognise that change was needed?<br><br> A general rethink about the laws of the game had been  prompted by the negativity of the 1990 World Cup and, in particular one  passage of play in the group match between the Republic of Ireland and  Egypt in which the Irish keeper Packie Bonner held the ball for almost  six minutes without releasing it.<br><br>     The new back-pass rule was eventually introduced in the summer of  1992. It first came into affect at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.  According to the Guardian, German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner has the honour  of being the last person to legally pick up a back-pass in a major  competition. He picked up Stefan Reuter&#39;s back-pass in the dying seconds  of the Euro 92 Final, where Germany trailed jammy surprise packages  Denmark 2-0. Presumably, he didn&#39;t hold onto it long. Furthermore, they  assert that Steve Nicol&#39;s pass back to Bruce Grobbelaar in the closing  stages of the 1992 FA Cup Final is the final such instance in the  English club game.  <div align="left">  </div>  <div align="left">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div><br><div><img align="bottom" alt="Pat Bonner signs, 16th May 1978 Evening Times snippet." height="320" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/6104031180468526b61100ccadf7c545/GW213H320" title="Pat Bonner signs, 16th May 1978 Evening Times snippet." width="213"></div><div><div align="left"><div align="left">  </div>  <div align="left">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div></div><div align="left"></div>  <div align="left">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div></div><div></div><div><div align="left">  </div>  <div align="left">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div></div><div></div></div></div>
