Reportedly a &quot;<i>live-for-the-day</i>&quot; type.<br><br>The Bhoy Bertie signed from junior outfit Glasgow Perthshire in October 1929 and the outside-right made his Celtic debut on November 16th that same year when the Hoops defeated Cowdenbeath 2-1 in a league tie at Parkhead. The following week Bertie was instrumental in a 6-1 victory at St.Johnstone and even got onto the score-sheet to cap an impressive start to his Celtic career.<br><br>Having quickly earned a regular starting spot it didn&#39;t take long for Bertie to win a permanent place in the hearts of the Celtic faithful. Coupling skill with a fierce battling quality Thomson played the game in a style guarenteed to win the approval of the Hoops support. His dashing wing play combined electric pace, tenacity and a fine dribbling ability. He could whip pinpoint crosses onto the head of the lethal Jimmy McGrory, while Thomson himself had a good eye for goal. It was said that everytime Bertie got the ball the Celtic crowd raised on their tip-toes in excited anticipation.<br><br>Bertie&#39;s slight frame suggested to some a fragility which never existed as such assumptions failed to account for his huge heart and courage. In their bid to stop Bertie opponents would often revert to tactics akin to assault. But Thomson never ducked a battle. Off the ball he was a terrier and his aggresion was easily a match for more physically intimidating rivals.<br><br>Perhaps the finest week in Bertie&#39;s career came in the spring of 1931. On Saturday April 11th that year a crowd of 104,803 gathered on the slopes of Hampden to witness a highly-rated Motherwell side face Celtic in the Scottish Cup final.<br><br>The Lanarkshire side were most people&rsquo;s tip to lift the Cup and they underlined their favourites tag by taking a 2-0 first-half lead. With just seven minutes of the game remaining McGrory pulled a goal back for the Bhoys and the stage was set for a dramatic climax. With the match entering its final seconds John Thomson hit a long clearance which Bertie collected on the right-wing. Having swiftly gathered the ball he raced down the touchline, beating two men, before sending a dangerous swirling high ball into the Well goalmouth.<br><br>With McGrory poised to pounce Motherwell centre-half Alan Craig leaped high to challenge, but his attempted clearance saw the ball glance off his forehead, past the out coming keeper and into the roof of the net. Celtic had grabbed the unlikest of last gasp reprieves.<br><br>When the Bhoys returned to Hampden for the replay Bertie&#39;s impact was even greater as his two goals helped Celtic lift the cup with an entertaining 4-2 victory. At the end of the game he tried to retain the ball on the wing (as he was told he wouldn&#39;t get the medal) in hope to keep it, but on not hearing the final whistle he just lumped it in the stand. <br><br>Bertie&#39;s ability on the pitch represented only part of the player&#39;s appeal to the Celtic support. With Glasgow suffering bitterly from the economic hardship of the time there was a certain everyman quality about Thomson which appealed to the fans. His skrawny frame and harsh pudding bowl haircut was more typical of the terraces than among well groomed sportsmen. His vices off the pitch - alcohol and gambling - were also those which blighted many lifes within the support and he was often seen around Glasgow enjoying a drink and a flutter with adoring Celtic fans.<br><br>His spendthrift ways though were far from self-indulgent. Bertie was renowned as kind-hearted, as cynics would say he was a sucker for a good sob story. Frequently putting his hand into his pocket for those seemingly less fortunate than himself it is perhaps no surprise the generous Bertie would encounter finanicial difficulties in his life.<br><br>Given his lifestyle it is equally unsurprising that Bertie had his difficulties with manager Willie Maley. Maley&#39;s strict and high standards were a disciplinary minefield for a personalty like Bertie. In September 1932 the disapproving Maley ordered Thomson to partake in double training having ruled him to be guilty of &quot;unsatisfactory play and physical condition&quot;.<br><br>Bertie refused to obey Maley&#39;s instructions and he was suspended by the club indefinitely until he belatedly apologised. He would appear in the 1933 Scottish Cup final - setting up the only goal in a 1-0 win over Motherwell - but once he had crossed the manager his days at Parkhead were always likely to be numbered. So it proved as in August 1933 Bertie was sold to Blackpool for a fee of &pound;5,000.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>A short spell in Lancashire was followed by a transfer to Motherwell. On 8th December 1934 he would take to Celtic Park pitch for the final time as the Steelmen took on the Hoops. Before the game Celtic supporters presented Thomson with a decorative claret and amber horseshoe, bedecked in green and white ribbons. Bertie would be cheered to the rafters that day by a support who genuinely adored him. Yet for many it would be the last they would talk of Bertie Thomson until a tearful day just short of three years later. <br><br>On 17th September 1937, Robert Thomson passed away in his mother&#39;s arms at 327 Argyle Street, Glasgow. He was just 30 years of age and had died from heart failure on the third birthday of his daughter Roberta. <br><br>His sad passing came as a desperate shock to the Celtic support and indeed his former Parkhead team-mates, who had only discovered the news in the death notices of the local papers.<br><br>On the day of his funeral, mounted police were called up to manage a crowd of some 10,000 which lined parts of Argyle St to pay their respects as the funeral cortege passed by. Thomson would be buried in the Abbey Cemetery in Elderslie. (Section F1 - Lair number 1135). <br><br>His gravestone reads - &quot;<i>Bertie, of Celtic FC&quot;</i>. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  Playing Career</h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1929-33</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  113</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  18</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  131</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals:</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  22</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  8</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  30</td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <h3>  Honours with Celtic</h3><b>Scottish Cup</b>   <br><ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1930-31" target="_self">1931</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1932-33" target="_self">1933</a></font></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Thomson%2C+Robert+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><img align="bottom" alt="Thomson, Robert - The Celtic Wiki" height="1024" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/366b139eee019bd00e02f2f17ab8fac7/GW789H1024" title="Thomson, Robert - The Celtic Wiki" width="789">  <br><img align="bottom" alt="Robert Thomson - Sued" height="910" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/24d51810e632753a22e82d808e306a62/GW467H910" title="Robert Thomson - Sued" width="467"><br></div></div>
