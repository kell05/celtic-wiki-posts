Quietly arriving with the Celtic support having little knowledge of his football background, it was a low key but interesting purchase.</font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">The recent loss of Wanyama was a big gap to fill in midfield, few if any players were going to be found that filled his shoes, and Nir Bitton didn&#39;t physically match him. Nevertheless, a good domestic reputation in Israel had sealed his transfer to Celtic, and his youth made him another long term project to watch out for. </font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">He had a difficult start, and took time to gel in.   A frustrating point was when he was sent off after only a few mins in his second Champions League match, after a daft and dangerous studs up challenge v Ajax. Showed he had a lot to learn, but everyone has these moments and it was something to learn from. Celtic still went on to win the match.</font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">  It didn&#39;t get him down and he laced up his boots to kick on with his Celtic career, much to everyone&#39;s hopes.    He really grew as a player in the 2014-15 season building a fair midfield pairing with Brown. From early 2015 he was being increasingly noticed for his effective play, settling in well into Deila&#39;s new pressing system of tactics. It was a great surprise, and with a cool head, he became indispensable and put in some surprisingly mature performances. He was to become a mainstay in the first team under Ronnie Deila.</font><br>  <br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the highlights of his time was an incredible 30 yard screamer into the postage stamp of the goals, from open play against Dundee in the league in May 2015. Such a goal would have been replayed endlessly if it was a big name, but he was still lauded to the hilts for this and it showed his quality and development. Remarkably that was first goal of the season, and we hoped it would give him confidence to try for more in the seasons ahead. </font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">His  best form was in season 2015-16, which was desperately needed as the  Ronnie Deila managerial experiment floundered. Not afraid to take long  shots, he scored some exceptional goals from long range that stood out. He could be quiet and then just pop up out of nowhere to fire in a chance. In a season that was floundering, he was helping to prop up the first team. However, he was magnet for disciplinary actions with a disproportionate number of cards handed out to him for mostly unnecessary challenges. </font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">  However, as Deila&#39;s reign floundered, so did that of all the players and Bitton&#39;s too. Once Brendan Rodgers arrived as manager in 2016-17, Bitton curiously became one of the few who did not seem to fall under his spell and develop. Bitton began to look passive, and wasn&#39;t contributing as much as was required. Granted Celtic had begun to step up, but Bitton hadn&#39;t. </font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was still a regular starter, yet he seemed to be either losing confidence or losing interest, but then again he was here for a good time and he was now a father and so on. It could be more that he didn&#39;t fit into the new system that Rodgers was implementing, and often a criticism was that Bitton did not take enough responsibility but instead just pass the ball along when possible. </font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">He played through much of the &#39;InVIncibles&#39; season, with Celtic winning the treble undefeated domestically, but he was to be a name little tagged with the achievement. Scoring just the one goal meant he was a shadow of the player he was previously praised for by some. He should still be respected for his part in the achievement.</font><br><div><br><font face="Helvetica">Nir Bitton had more technical ability than most players in this league, but he continued to play too often with too much passivity in the Celtic side. He needed to take charge as for example Scott Brown had again begun to do. When he shows some aggression, as he did in a 5-1 win over Rangers and a 3-3 draw with Manchester City, he became a more effective player. Unfortunately, that was no longer his default setting. He was too slow in his play in various games, both with and without the ball, and Celtic visibly improved when Stuart Armstrong took his place. Bitton was being clearly crowded out. </font></div><div><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica">Bitton even had to come out and publicly counter those criticising his efforts. As Rodgers dream debut season as manager rolled on, Bitton was left on the sidelines. The squad had a surplus of performing midfielders and Bitton was behind in the queue. He was to play a part but not significant that season.<br><br>H</font><font face="Helvetica">e was to be sidelined and relegated in the squad into the 2017-18 season but this was partly due to the form of players like Brown, Ntcham, Rogic and McGregor. With all due respect they were far better than Bitton, and were further developing, whilst Bitton wasn&#39;t. Bitton&#39;s name was rally lost or forgotten as the Rodger&#39;s reign went on.</font></div>   <br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">  A silly tweet (in humour) on his return to &#39;rainy Glasgow&#39; for the 2017-18 season didn&#39;t help him, but shouldn&#39;t be held against him, it was just humorous and not derogatory. There were plenty of good examples of where he reached out to supporters for photos and handing his own jerseys to young fans, when he was never asked to do so, it was a genuine decent &amp; thankful gesture from him to others. He started the season as captain of a scratch side against Lyon in a friendly at Celtic Park, but he was playing at centre half to backfill a position, and was sadly out of his depth. He didn&#39;t seem comfortable being reinvented as a centre-back. He was to become more of a squad player to be used when required rather than as a first team starter, so his career was faltering at Celtic.</font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">He was then out for most of 2018 with a knee injury, but the first team was to move on and into 2018/19 he was far from a first pick, relegated far back in the queue for a starting place.</font><br><br><font color="#333333" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif">[...TBC...]</font><br><br><br><br><div></div><div><h3>Note on Bitton and Israel-Palestine situation<br></h3></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="500"><tbody><tr><td class="                             WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mix politics and football... you are better than that!!

Granted, already the squad for many years could be like the league of nations, but following recent matches against Israeli sides in Europe, the embedded natural left-wing &amp; liberal tendencies came to the fore. The Celtic support has always championed support for various genuine causes.<br><br>Sadly, the Israel/Palestine struggles were re-igniting during his tenure at Celtic [of which the related issues we will leave for discussion to a more appropriate forum]. Celtic fans have been generally left-leaning and sympathetic towards the Palestinian cause as was shown by the flying of flags at the matches v Israeli sides. <br><br>However, despite this, Nir Bitton was not targetted by the support, and was respected. The odd unnecessary comment by the odd zealot in some voxpox was never reflective of the general support. Admittedly, there was a minority both within and outwith of Celtic who used the issue to target Bitton for their own ends. Bitton hit back at those targetting him which he was right to do, and won complete support from the majority, although some cynically took it as a deflection to his form on the field. <br><br>The issues concerning Israel/Palestine/Occupied Territories etc are with all due respect, outwith of the scope of this site and are best discussed in a more appropriate forum.<br><br>A tweet on twitter in support of his fellow countrymen serving in the army (for his own personal reasons) was not taken well by some within and outwith the support (and was avoidable), and really in general players across every club are warned to avoid political interaction or quotes for their own sake. It can lead to them being caught in the crossfire, especially from armchair warriors who can be extremely aggressive from the security of anonymity via social media.<br><br>It did not affect his acceptance or integration into the club. It wasn&#39;t a comfortable scenario, but he was always valued as a player, and it never was an issue to his place in the side.

face="Helvetica"><br> https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/celtic-s-nir-bitton-hits-out-at-fan-abuse-for-being-israeli-1-4743320<br> <br> Published: 17:55 <br> Tuesday 22 May 2018<br> Celtic&rsquo;s Nir Bitton has slammed the supporters who subject him to abuse on social media for being Israeli and called on them to stop mixing politics and football. <br> <br> The Ashdod-born player has had to contend with abuse from a section of the Celtic support in the past. <br> <br> In 2014, Celtic fans reacted with anger when Bitton posted a copy of the Hebrew Prayer for members of the Israeli Defence Forces - with whom he completed mandatory military service prior to his football career. <br> <br> A number of Celtic fans are known to be pro-Palestine and have protested against events in Gaza, particularly in European matches against sides from Israel such as Hapoel Tel-Aviv and Hapoel Be&rsquo;er-Sheva. <br> <br> Comments ranged from fans calling for the player to &ldquo;never be allowed to pull on a Celtic shirt again&rdquo; to supporters tweeting: &ldquo;Your support of child killers is not wanted at [Celtic Park].&rdquo;<br> <br> However, many Hoops fans have offered their support to Bitton whenever he is subjected to hurtful messages, insisting that, as a Celtic player, he doesn&rsquo;t deserve the abuse he receives. <br> <br> A little over a week ago, a Hoops fan sent abuse to the midfielder after he had posted a photo celebrating Israel&rsquo;s win in the Eurovision Song Contest. The individual replied to Bitton&rsquo;s post congratulating compatriot Netta Barzilai by writing: &ldquo;F*** you! Out our club!&rdquo; <br> <br> Bitton shared a screenshot of the message, telling his 73,000 followers: &ldquo;This boy needs some love.&rdquo; He also sent a reply saying: &ldquo;Haha shut the f*** up... I&rsquo;ll be here till my last second of my contract.&rdquo;<br> <br> But after his wife began receiving abusive messages on Instagram, the Israeli international hit back at the &ldquo;idiots&rdquo; who insult him.<br> <br> The 26-year-old wrote on Instagram: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just tired of replying to idiots who insult me because I&rsquo;m Israeli... so I&rsquo;m not gonna reply any more!<br> <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just ashamed of the people who insult me for such a thing like that... as a father, if you guys think I support the death of children or any human being then you are nothing but idiots!!!<br> <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all up for the banter but not when you guys [are] texting my wife&rsquo;s instagram... I&rsquo;ve been getting abuse for a while so I just felt that I had to say that!<br> <br> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mix politics and football... you are better than that!! Love you all.&rdquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></font><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3>  <h3>  </h3>BITTON&rsquo;S DEBT TO LENNY<br>https://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/bittons-debt-to-lenny/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<br>By CQN Magazine on 11th May 2020 Latest News<br><br>NIR BITTON has revealed he is determined to make Neil Lennon proud as he looks forward to 10 years as a Celtic player.<br><br>The versatile Israeli international, 28, was brought to Parkhead during the Irishman&rsquo;s first stint in August 2013 and he agreed a contract extension in December last year that will keep him at the champions until June 2023.<br><br>Bitton, who was out for almost an entire season through injury in 2018, has admitted he will be forever grateful to Lennon for being given the opportunity to play for the Parkhead club.<br><br>The team boss and the player, who is comfortable in central defence and midfield, were reunited in February last year, of course, when Brendan Rodgers made his sharp and unexpected exit to Leicester City.<br><br>WELCOME BACK, BOSS&hellip;Nir Bitton celebrates with Euan Henderson after James Forrest&rsquo;s goal in the 2-1 win over Hearts at Tynecastle in February 2019 &ndash; Neil Lennon&rsquo;s first game on his return to the club.<br><br>Bitton, who is in his homeland during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown, told Celtic TV: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the manager who brought me to Celtic, he&rsquo;s the manager who gave me the opportunity, and I&rsquo;ll be very grateful to him for the rest of my life.<br><br>&ldquo;Me and the gaffer have a very good relationship. He&rsquo;s a very honest man, he&rsquo;s a top man to work with, the one-on-one coaching is the top level and I&rsquo;ll do everything I can to make him proud.<br><br>&ldquo;He returned last season under not the easiest of circumstances. It was a tough time when Brendan left. For us, the senior players, we knew him from before and obviously we tried to help him, speak to the other guys about what he wants, what he&rsquo;s like.&rdquo;<br><br>It transpired to be a glorious comeback as Lennon guided the team to an eighth successive crown as well as adding the Scottish Cup with a 2-1 victory over Hearts at Hampden on the iconic date of May 25 to complete the historic treble treble.<br><br>The smooth operator added: &ldquo;When I first signed with Celtic when I was 21 years old, if you had told me back then that I would be at Celtic for 10 years, I would have bitten your hand off.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a dream come true for me, for my family to play at this level for a long time and I just want to keep it going and to try and help the team win games and trophies and be part of this successful club. And also to make sure we&rsquo;re making everyone proud.<br><br>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re out for almost a year, and you suffer a tough injury, you start to appreciate the small things in life. You don&rsquo;t take the simple things in life for granted. I&rsquo;ve said it before, that every single minute I get on the pitch I will try to do my best and try to help the team.<br><br>&ldquo;Right now, for me, it&rsquo;s about trying to stay fit, stay healthy and aim to play as many games as I can and win trophies with Celtic.&rdquo;  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></font><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3>  <h3>  </h3><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> </font><br><div><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></font><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3>  <h3>  </h3></div><div><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></font></font></font><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3>  <h3>  </h3></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></font><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3>  <h3>  </h3></div><div></div><div></div></div></div>
