BT Sport bosses were unhappy with the Rangers manager for failing to give an interview after Friday night&rsquo;s win over Inverness. However, Warburton insists he was merely busy, and that his absence had nothing to do with prior criticism from pundit Chris Sutton.</font></font></li><li><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3">Henrik Larsson&rsquo;s old agent Rob Jansen has revealed that Celtic and Rangers were very close to quitting Scottish football in 1999 after plans to begin a new &lsquo;Euroleague&rsquo; fell apart in the final stages.</font></font></li><li><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">Chris Sutton has laughed off Rangers boss Mark Warburton&rsquo;s claims that the gap is closing between the two Glasgow sides and that there wasn&rsquo;t much of a gulf in yesterday&rsquo;s match. Sutton said: &ldquo;Yes the scoreline was closer [than the 5-1 meeting earlier in the season] but clearly they haven&rsquo;t got close enough! The gulf is enormous! Let&rsquo;s be absolutely honest &ndash; it was a total mismatch at Hampden.

Sevco on the other hand were making a mockery of their pre season hype, claiming to be a major side in Scotland but actually played and employed tactics as a third tier side would use. They really were going for penalties from the start. None of their side worthy of a start in Celtic&#39;s team. <br><br></font><font color="#000000" size="3">  </font></font><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3">The football was good from Celtic with another battling performance. The main talking points were:<br>a Hun getting a yellow for diving in the box (good call), <br>Dembele lucky not getting one for a silly dive (ref had back turned), <br>a clear goal by Celtic wrongly chopped off <br>then Dembele scoring a peach of a goal (back heeling the ball and nutmegging a defender and the goalkeeper to score);<br>Sinclair unfortunate not to score from his free kick, off the bar and so on<br>unfair yellow card for Griffiths at the end (he began celebrating but didn&#39;t realise match was not yet over, then 3 seconds later it was!). <br><br></font><font color="#000000" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" size="3">Celtic were as dominant as in the 5 1 win, but maybe after recent exploits we were a bit jaded. <br><br>Any low notes? Celtic gave Huns one chance they didn&#39;t deserve and they could have scored but it was mostly innocuous. Bitton is out of sorts and should be dropped, whilst Gordon&#39;s distribution is still going awry too often. </font><font color="#000000" size="3">  </font></font><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3">Ref was often poor in the match (out of his depth) but still made a good call with the diving Hun but shambles at the disallowed Celtic goal. <br><br></font><font color="#000000" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" size="3">Anyhow another good win and the treble is still on.</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br><br>(Markyb of KDS)<br>Thought we played well enough though the front 3 were off the boil. Not even so much just in not taking their chances but making the wrong decisions at times. Then behind them Brown was basically on his own as Bitton appeared to have just decided to do what I will be doing at my work today and entering cruise control. <br><br>Thought the back 5 (inc Gordon) did well and with Brown running about like he owned the place (which he did) we gave them virtually nothing. As mentioned many times, it was so similar to a game against the likes of Ross County or ICT. Almost total domination but the other team will always get the odd chance and Simunovic (who&#39;s looking better and better) did superbly. <br><br>As for Thomson. I said on Twitter I thought he gave us a few in the first half. McKay booking (lets be honest I thought it he&#39;d given the penalty even though on first look I knew he&#39;d gotten the ball) and not booking Dembelle for the same offense. Bitton was lucky not to be booked as well. Then it seemed to me that that first half was to &#39;even up&#39; a second half performance of staggering bias.

leaves it late to defeat Rangers in Old Firm semi-final<br>Guardian.com<br><br><div class="spoiler">Brendan Rodgers is within 90 minutes of scratching a professional itch. A criticism of the Celtic manager has been the failure to claim a major domestic honour during his previous spells in England. This success over Rangers and the scheduling nuances of the Scottish League Cup means Rodgers could end that wait before November is out, with Aberdeen lying in wait upon Celtic&rsquo;s Hampden Park return.<br><br>Rodgers barely needs endorsement of his early months in charge but tangible reward always helps. This derby tonic arrived just days after the wounding Champions League defeat to Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach and, it must be noted, at a venue where Celtic have endured several horror shows in recent times. The final should be worthy of high-profile status; Celtic and Aberdeen, for now, look the best two teams in Scotland.<br><br>&ldquo;It has been a great start,&rdquo; said Rodgers of his Celtic baptism. &ldquo;You can see this team&rsquo;s mentality, their spirit and their skill. There is a huge desire to succeed here and the team is performing at the top level. But in order to put a stamp on that, you want to win trophies. In order to win those trophies, we have to get to cup finals.&rdquo;<br><br>In other words: so far, so good. This semi-final was always likely to be played in context of what came so closely before. Celtic&rsquo;s 5-1 hammering of Rangers in September meant analysis of what chasm may exist between the Glasgow clubs would overshadow the ins and outs of a marquee occasion. Rangers were so appallingly open in that league game that they were hardly going to replicate Ajax of 1970 next time around, even if they had the resource to consider as much.<br><br>Celtic may have required the 87th-minute intervention of Moussa Demb&eacute;l&eacute;, a player for whom adulation grows and grows, to breach Rangers&rsquo; resistance but they were always the more menacing side. In Demb&eacute;l&eacute;, Rodgers also had one of several players in green and white who seemed the more likely matchwinners. The French striker combined brilliantly with Leigh Griffiths, then flicked home the decisive goal.<br><br>This flow of play, in part, shouldn&rsquo;t be taken as a criticism of Rangers, who were defensively organised to a far greater extent than the last time the teams met. However, there is a recurring question mark over potency. In nine league matches, Rangers have scored only 11 times; the same record as Motherwell and Hamilton Academical. Their attacking threat here was negligible to the point where it was legitimate to question the validity of what spending the Ibrox club have bestowed on forward players.<br><br>Demb&eacute;l&eacute; cost a third of the transfer fee Rangers handed to Preston North End for Joe Garner, a forward introduced with 20 minutes to play here and may as well still be running around the Hampden pitch now whilst looking to make some kind of positive impact.<br><br>&ldquo;The gap [to Celtic] is a lot more narrow than people think,&rdquo; insisted Mark Warburton, the Rangers manager. This sentiment was curious; after beating Celtic in last season&rsquo;s Scottish Cup semi-final, Warburton pointed towards the same gulf he is now denying. In the meantime, Celtic have undoubtedly improved, with scepticism over whether Rangers have done likewise.<br><br>Whereas historically Old Firm fixtures may have been overshadowed by bouts of madness either on or off the field, the match was played in a fine competitive spirit amid which football sporadically broke out. Of four yellow cards, only one was for a poor tackle.<br><br>Another booking marked a key moment in the first half, the Rangers winger Barrie McKay rightly penalised for toppling far too easily when little more than breathed upon by Jozo Simunovic inside Celtic&rsquo;s penalty area. Demb&eacute;l&eacute; was lucky to escape a caution for similar theatrics, having thrown himself to the turf between two Rangers defenders.<br><br>More positive was an excellent Matt Gilks save from Scott Sinclair after Demb&eacute;l&eacute; had played him through on goal. Aside from that, plus a comedy moment as Gilks and Jason Holt combined to afford Tom Rogic an opportunity he didn&rsquo;t seem to believe, Rangers&rsquo; policy of containment was successful.<br><br>The game&rsquo;s controversial moment &ndash; there is always one &ndash; arrived four minutes after the interval. Only the referee, Craig Thomson, could explain what he deemed wrong with a Erik Sviatchenko header which found the back of Rangers&rsquo; net. Sviatchenko had tangled with Clint Hill but apportioning blame at all, not least to the Celtic player, was harsh to the point of being unfathomable.<br><br>Perhaps roused by their lucky escape, Rangers carved out the chance which they later rued. For all Holt wasted it, Simunovic is due praise for a timely block.<br><br>Celtic pushed and pressed to an increasing degree as the clock ticked down. Griffiths, a rather handy substitute to call upon, scampered away from Wallace before feeding the player he now has a decent claim to play alongside from the start of games. Celtic&rsquo;s celebrations emphasised their earlier frustrations. &ldquo;We got the reward we thoroughly deserved,&rdquo; said Rodgers. It would have been nonsensical to quibble.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">BBC<br></font><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3"> By Tom English<br> BBC Scotland at Hampden<br> </font><font color="#000000" size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">23 October 2016</font></font><font face="Helvetica"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><br></font></font></font><font face="Helvetica"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><br></font></font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica"><br></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> Moussa Dembele&#39;s 14th goal of the season took Celtic through to the final<br> Celtic will play Aberdeen in the Scottish League Cup final after Moussa Dembele secured a late victory over Rangers in the Old Firm semi-final.<br> Brendan Rodgers&#39; side had the better of the Hampden match with Scott Sinclair, Tom Rogic, Dembele and Stuart Armstrong drawing saves from Matt Gilks.<br> Erik Sviatchenko had a goal disallowed for Celtic and Sinclair&#39;s free-kick was touched on to the bar by Gilks.<br> But there was to be a winner, Dembele&#39;s heel converting Leigh Griffiths&#39; cross.<br> Rangers, 5-1 losers at Celtic Park last month, were restricted to counter-attacks, the best of which ended with Jason Holt&#39;s shot being blocked well by Jozo Simunovic.<br> Celtic will return to Hampden to face the Dons on Sunday 27 November.<br> This captivating semi-final set off at a fair old lick and barely let up all day. It was altogether different to the one-sided encounter at Celtic Park, on the scoreboard at least. Celtic had a huge array of chances but were met with stiff Rangers resistance, most notably from their goalkeeper Gilks.<br> In the beginning there was controversy. When is there not in this fixture? In the 14th minute, Barrie McKay crashed to the floor in the box under a challenge from Simunovic. The Rangers fans screamed for a penalty. Craig Thomson, the referee, went the opposite way, booking McKay for a dive.<br> Barrie McKay is booked<br> Some onlookers initially thought Thomson blew for a penalty rather than simluation<br> Dembele dived in the Rangers penalty area soon after and got away with it. Not that it needed it, but the intensity cranked up another notch in those moments.<br> Celtic had so many opportunities but they did not have the ruthlessness of before. They attacked off a Lee Wallace blunder and when Dembele put Sinclair through, Gilks denied him.<br> Gilks, in the team ahead of Wes Foderingham as per previous rounds of the competition, then almost gifted Celtic a goal when passing directly to Rogic. Had the Australian hit a shot first time he surely would have scored from such close range. Had he squared to a team-mate, it was a goal. Instead, he took a touch and got crowded out. A terrible waste.<br> In the early minutes of the second half, Sviatchenko headed home only for Thomson to rule it out for a foul on Clint Hill. It was another big call by the referee - and a harsh one. The foul on the defender was highly questionable.<br> Erik Sviatchenko<br> Sviatchenko scored against Rangers in April and thought he had done so again only to be penalised<br> Rangers had their first shot on target in the 50th minute, a tame effort by James Tavernier, playing further forward on the right with Lee Hodson selected at right-back. Celtic drove on. Sinclair forced another save from Gilks after Rangers were sliced open in defence. Then, Rogic had a snapshot that went just wide.<br> One-way traffic, for sure, but what an almighty scare Rangers gave their rivals just before the hour when Holt had a point-blank shot blocked down by Simunovic. Either side of the big defender and Holt would surely have landed a sucker blow.<br> Celtic continued to pile on the pressure and create a mountain of chances. Dembele scuffed a shot from close in, then a Sinclair free-kick somehow stayed out, Gilks getting a touch on it and putting it on to the crossbar. <br> By now, Griffiths was on the field and Celtic were playing two up front. Stuart Armstrong was also on as Rodgers went for the Rangers jugular. It was Armstrong who had the next chance, seven minutes from time, but once again the quite brilliant Gilks kicked away his effort. <br> With three minutes left, it looked like extra time beckoned, but no. There was a dramatic last act. Celtic hoofed it out of defence and Wallace lost a physical tussle with Griffiths, who scampered away from him down the right.<br> He delivered his low cross with the outside of his left boot to Dembele running in at the near post. What Dembele did next was delicious - an improvised back-heel that beat the seemingly unbeatable Gilks. A wonderful goal that finally broke Rangers and sent Celtic into the final, giving Rodgers an early chance to claim the first trophy of his Celtic tenure.<br><br> Match ends, Rangers 0, Celtic 1.<br> Full Time<br> Posted at <br> 90&#39;+5&#39; <br> Second Half ends, Rangers 0, Celtic 1.<br> Booking<br> Posted at <br> 90&#39;+5&#39; <br> Leigh Griffiths (Celtic) is shown the yellow card.<br> Substitution<br> Posted at <br> 90&#39;+1&#39; <br> Substitution, Celtic.
