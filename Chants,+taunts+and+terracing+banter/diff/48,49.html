In this  article we take a journey through the years and recall some of the best  ones since the inception of the Premier League in 1975. (note: much of this is from St Anthony&#39;s article from CU (see </span><a class="external" href="http://archive.celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=730&Itemid=124" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffAdd">link</span></a><span class="diffAdd">))</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1975/76 </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We are sailing, we are sailing</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Home gain across the sea</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We are sailing stormy waters</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> To be near you to be free</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In the summers of 1975 and 1976 Rod Stewart topped the charts for a long  period with this well known number. During this time Celtic fans  adopted it as their anthem and was sung in a &lsquo;walk on&rsquo; style with  scarves held aloft as they sang it. This temporarily replaced &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll  Never Walk Alone&rsquo; but the old favourite returned soon after. It is said  that Rod the Mod&rsquo;s best moment in football was when he visited Parkhead  and heard the Celtic fans sing it. And not bad were they at it too.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1976/77</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He used to be a Hun but he&rsquo;s alright now</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Alfie, Alfie</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He used to be Hun but he&rsquo;s alright now </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Alfiie, Alfie Conn</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> (Tune: Camptown Races)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In March 1977 Scottish football was rocked to the core when ex Rangers  favourite Alfie Conn signed for the Celts. Jock Stein was so concerned  that he discussed the matter with senior pros Kenny Dalglish and Danny  McGrain to ascertain if there would be difficulties in the dressing  room. The answer was there was no problem but the big man did not know  what the reaction of the Celtic support would be. He need not have  worried. As Alfie ran out on a cold midweek fixture against Partick  Thistle the Jungle burst into song and this would be a favourite chant  for Celtic fans during Alfie&rsquo;s say at Celtic. And he scored that night  as well.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">    1977/78</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Peter Latchford, Peter Latchford</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Give us a w-a-a-ve! Give us a w-a-a-ve!!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Cue Peter waving to the fans and they respond with:</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Latchford! Latchford! Or &lsquo;Latchford for England, Latchford for England !&rsquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> This season is remembered for all the wrong reasons. Dalglish&rsquo;s departure, Stein&rsquo;s final year and a season so poor that we did not qualify for Europe for the first time since 1962. The one positive was the consistent performance of goalkeeper Peter Latchford who performed heroics on an almost weekly basis. &lsquo;The Cat&rsquo; had a great rapport with the fans although time can sober the mind and the thought of big Peter replacing Shilton or Clemence in an England jersey is clearly preposterous.</span><b>1979<br></b>Ten men won the league, tra-la-la-la-la<br><i>Celtic fans celebrate the sensational 4-2 championship decider with a re-writing of the Boney M song &#39;Brown Girl in the rain&#39; </i><br><br><span class="diffRemove">1988</span><span class="diffRemove">   </span><br><span class="diffAdd">1978/79</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Ten men won the League tra-la-la-la-la</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Ten men won the league...Tra-la-la-la-la-la&hellip;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> (Sung to the tune of Boney M&rsquo;s hit &lsquo;Brown Girl in the Ring&rsquo;)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> On 21rst May 1979 Celtic defeated Rangers 4-2 to win the most dramatic title finish of all time. The fact that they were down to 10 men and 0-1 down at the time has only added to the legend and this song was sung at the end of the game that night in tribute to the team. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1979/80</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We only need 10 men </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We only need 10 men, </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We only need </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We only need 10 men</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> (Sung to the tune of Mary Hopkins&rsquo; &lsquo;Those were the days my friend&rsquo;)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We stick with the 10 men theme with a song that was sung regularly that season given Celtic&rsquo;s poor disciplinary record. On the following occasions Celtic fought back after having a player sent off much to the delight of the support. Nothing wrong with team moral in those days.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Aug 1979 Rangers away 2-2 (0-2 down when Aitken ordered off)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Sep 1979 Aberdeen away 2-1 (0-1 down when Tommy Burns was sent off after almost halving a young Gordon Strachan in two)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Sep 1979 St Mirren home 3-1 (MacDonald sent off)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Feb 1980 St Mirren away 3-2 (McAdam sent off at 0-1)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1980/81</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> One Kenny Ashwood, there&rsquo;s only one Kenny Ashwood, one Kenny Ashwood, there&rsquo;s only one Kenny Ashwood!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Who in the name of the Good Lord I hear you ask is Kenny Ashwood? On March 8th 1981 during a particularly dull Scottish cup tie against East Stirling the Celtic crowd turned their attention to a particularly small player in East Stirling colours. Out of amusement the Jungle began to cheer the East Stirling players&rsquo; every touch particularly this one wee guy in the number 10 shirt. The programme listed the player as Kenny Ashwood when in fact the wee guy concerned was Bobby McCulley. Ashwood was running around Parkhead totally perplexed to why the Jungle should be chanting his name, meanwhile McCulley became something of a minor celebrity in Scottish football circles afterwards, being named as Scotland&rsquo;s smallest player at 5 feet 2 inches after his Parkhead appearance.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1981/82</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We&rsquo;ve won the league again, fly the flag, fly the flag&hellip;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In the early 1980&rsquo;s British Airways had an advert with a particularly catchy tune with the lyrics &lsquo;Well take more care of you fly the flag, fly the flag&rsquo;, to urge patriotic Brits to use their national passenger carrier before any of those beastly foreign airlines.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Celtic had led the league table since the first day in August and so confident where the Celtic fans of winning it around spring time they adopted this song as their own and it can be indeed heard around Parkhead until this day. The irony was that Alex Ferguson&rsquo;s Aberdeen went on a long unbeaten run and almost snatched it from us, only a late flurry of goals against St Mirren in the second half of the final day of the season saved our necks.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1982/83</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> When it&rsquo;s spring again</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We&rsquo;ll sing again</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 2-1 in Amsterdam</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> On 29th September 1982 Celtic had their most famous European win in years when they beat Ajax, Johan Cruyff et al, in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. George McCluskey&rsquo;s last gasp winner became the stuff of legend and for a short while we actually dared to dream that we could win the damned thing again after 16 years.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> The next game was against Dundee United on October 2nd at a packed Tannadice and the Celtic fans sang this continuously throughout the game. One can only wonder what Max Bygraves would have thought of all this. Celtic blew a two goal lead and it finished 2-2 even though at the time the fans were not that perturbed although it was to prove a costly point dropped when six months later United edged Celts by one point to win their only league title.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1983/84</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Davie Dodds the elephant man</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Davie Dodds the elephant man </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> (Sung to the tune of The Piranha&rsquo;s Tom Hark)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> One of the peculiarities of the old terraces was that fans could congregate and pick on individual players with chanting, sometimes viciously in the cases of Joe Harper and Derek Johnstone, which are not worth repeating. One of the more humourus instances regarded Dundee United striker Davie Dodds. It&rsquo;s fair to say that Davie wasn&rsquo;t really the most attractive looking footballer in his day and when he approached the Jungle to take a corner kick in the 1980&rsquo;s around ten thousand fans could be heard singing the above whilst waving their arm from their nose outwards to imitate an elephant&rsquo;s trunk. It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Dodds often got the last laugh as his scoring record against us of the years was particularly impressive. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1984/85</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Feed the Bear</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Feed the Bear</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Feed the Bear</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Feed the Bear, feed the Bear&hellip;!!!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> This chant had already been popular with Celtic supporters in the 1960&rsquo;s when it was sung in praise of Yogi Bear himself, John Hughes.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> By the 1980&rsquo;s it had become a favourite again as a new nickname for Roy Aitken, fondly christened &lsquo;The Bear&rsquo;, in praise of his aggressive, hustling playing style. But it was never sang with greater feeling than on the day of the 1985 Scottish cup final against Dundee United when big Roy almost single handedly won the cup with a heroic, energetic last twenty minutes in which David Hay had pushed him forward from defence into midfield to inspire the team to a 2-1 win. This chant was also sung on various occasions when Celtic players had been roughed up and the fans would call for big Roy to take retribution on the culprits concerned.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1985/86</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Na na na na </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Na na na na </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Hey hey hey, </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Glasgow Celtic</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> This short, simple wee chant was adopted from the Bananarama song of the period which I believe was titled &lsquo;Kiss him goodbye&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s said that the girls were well chuffed when told that Celtic fans had adopted it as at least one of them has Irish origins and presumably has a liking for the club.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1986/87</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We don&rsquo;t nee your Terry Butcher</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We don&rsquo;t need your Chris Woods too</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We don&rsquo;t need your Graham Roberts</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We don&rsquo;t need your English crew</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Hey!

We didn&rsquo;t know it at the time but the writing was now on the wall for the old Celtic dynasty of the Kelly&rsquo;s and White&rsquo;s. The above song was sung during Souness&rsquo;s first season when Rangers won their first title in nine years mainly due to their new &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; influx. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1987/88</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Happy birthday to you</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Happy birthday to you</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Happy birthday dear Celtic</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Happy birthday to you</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> At this time Celtic celebrated their centenary and it was not unusual to hear the fans sing this, particularly near the end of this very successful season. A special word must go to the Dunfermline fans on the last day of the season who, although relegated, came to Parkhead with a huge banner stating &ndash; &lsquo;Happy Birthday Celtic PS Jim we&rsquo;ll be back&rsquo;.

Mark McGhee!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I have a confession to make. I would never have signed Mark McGhee if I had my way, in fact I don&rsquo;t think I would have allowed him to pay at the turnstiles after his theatrics in the 1984 Scottish cup final which led to Roy Aitken&rsquo;s sending off and ultimately, Celtic&rsquo;s defeat that day. But sign he did and after his arrival from Hamburg in November 1985 he hardly kicked a ball for us in three seasons. Perennially injured and when he did play he looked out of shape compared to the Aberdeen version we had suffered at the hands off on so many occasions. Then, in the autumn of 1988, a funny thing happened. McGhee became fit and started to play and was the SPL&rsquo;s top scorer that season. His contract was up at the end of the season and he legged it to Newcastle. Was his new found form good fortune or did he see his chance coming with his contract coming to an end? You tell me.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1989/90</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Ooooh Mikey, Mikey</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Mikey, Mikey Mikey</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Mikey Galloway!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Mike Galloway joined Celtic from Hearts with a big reputation for scoring important goals. However Mike&rsquo;s Celtic career suffered with managerial changes and a versatility that done him no favours. Mike was played at full back, centre half and in midfield but never held down a regular place in any position.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> The one thing Celtic fans knew to expect from Galloway was total commitment and for this reason he was always popular with the supporters. Sadly, a car crash brought an end to his career while he was on loan at Leicester and despite Celtic granting him a testimonial it&rsquo;s fair to say he has had personal problems since them. We wish him well.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1990/91</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Joe, Joe, super Joe</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Joe, Joe, super Joe</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Joe, Joe, super Joe</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Super Joey Miller</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In 1987 Celtic signed Joe Miller who was arguably the best prospect in British football. It was an unexpected signing which added to the anticipation that the fans felt, looking forward to seeing him in his best years. Unfortunately Joe never developed into the player we hoped for although he did have his moment particularly in this season when he lashed a wonder goal past Andy Goram in the Hibs goal on a brilliant sunny September afternoon. In this season Joe actually hit double figures in what was his most productive period. However Joe was terribly inconsistent and more often it was average Joe rather than super Joe when he wore the hoops.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1991/92</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> A one, two and a three</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Cha-cha-cha!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> It was the dirtiest game you&rsquo;ll ever see</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Between Glasgow Celtic</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> The champions of Europe </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> And Racing from Argentine</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I sometimes feel cheated and the reason is this. Around my mid 20&rsquo;s when I was at the peak of my Celtic supporting life the then Celtic team I followed everywhere with undying support happened to be arguably the worst team since the 1940&rsquo;s. These were bleak days. No team, no money, no stadium and no hope. In order to keep their spirits up the fans turned to the past and I recall one freezing cold day at East End Park in January </span><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Bold">1992</span><span class="diffAdd"> when the fans went through the full repertoire of old songs, Lisbon, the 7-1 game, the Coronation cup, the lot, but the above song is the one that sticks in my mind most. We had nothing to sing about in the present so it made sense that we sang about the past.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br>&quot;Oh, Lets all laugh at Chelsea, o lets all a Chelsea... &quot;<br>(Sung at Parkhead after we somehow convinced Chelsea to swap Cascarino for Tom Boyd!)<br><br>He&#39;s tall, he&#39;s skinny<br>He&#39;s goin&#39; to Barlinnie<br>Ferguson, Ferguson<br>(aimed at Duncan Ferguson, going to jail after head butting Raith Rovers player)<br><br>Ian Durrant Collection:<br>1) He&#39;s wet, he&#39;s moist,<br>He&#39;s ******* Ally McCoist,<br>Ian Durrant, Ian Durrant...<br><br>2) He&#39;s a pauper, he&#39;s a begger,<br>he&#39;s shuggin John McGregor, <br>Ian Durrant, Ian Durrant.<br><br>3) He&#39;s blue, he&#39;s white<br>He&#39;s absolutely shi*te<br>Ian Durrant, Durrant<br><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1992/93</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Sack the board</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Sack the board</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Sack the board</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Sack the board!!!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> By the early 1990&rsquo;s the majority of Celtic fans realised they had two battles to win. Before they could even consider taking on a resurgent Rangers they would have to defeat the closed shop of Celtic directors who lacked vision and finance and were only interested in retaining their privileged positions. As Rangers grew from strength to strength the reaction of the fans to the board became more vitriolic with each passing week. As in all good fantasies there is a happy ending. A wee Canadian Prince called Fergus came along and banished the beastly directors into the wilderness. The Prince then set his sights on the destruction of the dark side and the cause of goodness and light prevailed again. But in 1993 it would be a long time in coming.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1993/94</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Lou, Lou, skip to my Lou</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Lou, Lou skip to my Lou</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Lou, Lou skip to my Lou</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Skip to my Lou Macari</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I have issues with several players who have left Celtic over the years. When I was young I could never forgive Macari, Hay and Dalglish for departing to England. They all returned in a management capacity, Hay in 1983, Macari in 1993 and Dalglish for a short period in 1999. For the record I would not have had any of them back under any circumstances. It is a disgrace that Danny McGrain who committed his entire playing career to Celtic is today a lowly coach at the club while we ran cap in hand to the above three to bring them back to a location that they couldn&rsquo;t wait to get away from in the first place.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Macari&rsquo;s arrival as manger was the most curious one. It was the last throw of the dice from the old board, time was running out for them and they knew it. They gambled that Macari&rsquo;s arrival would buy them time but things were too far on at that stage. Anyone who recalls Macari&rsquo;s departure as a player in 1973 will know that he left under a cloud and happily Fergus moved him on quickly. Pack your bags Luigi, you&rsquo;re leaving. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 1994/95</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We&rsquo;ll meet again</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Don&rsquo;t know where</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Don&rsquo;t know when</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> But I know we&rsquo;ll meet again</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Some sunny day</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> (With apologies to Dame Vera Lynn)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In May </span><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Bold">1995</span><span class="diffAdd"> Celtic travelled to Tannadice for their last league game of the season. We were more focused on the following week&rsquo;s cup final at Hampden against Airdrie but United had to win as they were desperate to avoid relegation to the First Division. Phil O&rsquo;Donnell scored the only goal of the game early in the second half. The Celtic fans were in party mood and broke into the above humourous song for the last twenty minutes. Tannadice was packed that day and it has to be said the United fans took it all very well. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br>#There&#39;s only two Andy Gorams, Two Andy Gorams....#<br>(Sung at Ibrox after Andy Goram was diagnosed as schizophrenic).<br><br><span class="diffRemove">#We&#39;ll Meet</span><br><br> <span class="diffRemove">Again,</span><span class="diffAdd">1995/96</span><br> <span class="diffRemove">don&#39;t</span><br> <span class="diffRemove">know</span><span class="diffAdd">There&rsquo;s</span> <span class="diffRemove">where,</span><span class="diffAdd">only</span> <span class="diffRemove">don&#39;t</span><span class="diffAdd">one</span> <span class="diffRemove">know</span><span class="diffAdd">Johnny</span> <span class="diffRemove">when,</span><span class="diffAdd">Collins</span><br><span class="diffRemove">but</span> <span class="diffRemove">I</span><span class="diffAdd">There&rsquo;s</span> <span class="diffRemove">know</span><span class="diffAdd">only</span> <span class="diffRemove">we&#39;ll</span><span class="diffAdd">one</span> <span class="diffRemove">meet</span><span class="diffAdd">Johnny</span> <span class="diffRemove">again</span><span class="diffAdd">Collins</span><br> <span class="diffRemove">some</span><span class="diffAdd">He</span> <span class="diffRemove">sunny</span><span class="diffAdd">bends</span> <span class="diffRemove">day.#</span><span class="diffAdd">the ball</span><br><span class="diffRemove">(Sung</span> <span class="diffRemove">on</span><span class="diffAdd">Around the</span> <span class="diffAdd">wall</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Walking in </span>a <span class="diffRemove">visit</span><span class="diffAdd">Collins wonderland</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In 1990 Celtic were about</span> to <span class="diffRemove">newly-relegated</span><span class="diffAdd">sign</span> <span class="diffRemove">Dundee</span><span class="diffAdd">John</span> <span class="diffRemove">United,</span><span class="diffAdd">Collins</span> <span class="diffRemove">around</span><span class="diffAdd">and Rangers tried to hijack</span> the <span class="diffRemove">time</span><span class="diffAdd">move by offering him triple the wages Celtic were offering.

Happily the modern day fans have adopted it and it is currently a big hit particularly with the away support.</span><br><br>Tell all the Gers in pain<br>That we&#39;re heading for sunshine again<br>Though your season is gone<br>The Bill is still on<br>And our beach balls are going back to Spain<br><i>(sung by some fans before returning to Spain to play Barca)</i><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffRemove">2006</span><span class="diffAdd"> 2004/05</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> There&rsquo;s only one Johnny Hartson</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> There&rsquo;s only one Johnny Hartson</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He&rsquo;s got no hair but we don&rsquo;t care</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Walking in a Hartson wonderland</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> It&rsquo;s hard to believe that John Hartson came within an inch of joining Rangers. After a slow start big bad John went on to become a Celtic legend, scoring in excess of 100 goals in a five year spell. When you think back to the Larsson - Sutton - Hartson triumvirate you remember that we were indeed spoiled for choice for forwards at that time.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> 2005/06</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Oh Artur Boruc</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> The holy goalie</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He hates the Huns</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He blessed himself at Ibrox </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> And the Huns went off their nut</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He is the Polish goalie</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> And he sings God bless the Pope</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Despite his recent lapses Artur Boruc remains one of the most popular Celts of the modern era. Indeed if he left immediately he would still be immortalised as a Celt for his on field heroics over the last four seasons. Three in a row and the last sixteen in the Champions League would not have been even a remote possibility without that big man in goal. Think of the mediocre dross in that position we had to contend with before Boruc and you will discover the reason for his popularity.</span><br><br>#Paul Le Guens gonna get the sack <br>We&#39;ve won the league before the clocks went back#<br>(29<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Oct 2006, Kilmarnock v Celtic/Celtic went 12pts ahead of Rangers after<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Rangers drew on the Saturday/Celtic winning on the Sunday, before the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>clocks went back 1hour for daylight saving in autumn!)<br><br>&quot;the sky is blue, the grass is green....we&#39;ve won the league by Halloween!&quot;<br>(Oct 2006)<br><br><i>Paul LeGuen?
