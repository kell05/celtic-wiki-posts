There was a lot of debate out there about Celtic&#39;s attempts to sign him, some good, bad and ugly, plus also strong dissenting voices.   <br><br>He was arriving a young man with a lot of baggage. He was seen as potentially another Derek Riordan problem (both were former Hibs players), and Celtic didn&#39;t need a repeat set of problems as occurred with Riordan. <br><br>Leigh was young, he&#39;d made some bad mistakes (including a daft racist tweet at one time prior to his time at Celtic) and now here he had to learn and make up for the past, and the shambles that was Derek Riordan&#39;s career should be a warning to him. Riordan had actually quipped in a previous interview that: <br><blockquote>  <i>&quot;I was his hero growing up and I&rsquo;m flattered.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>His advisers helped him post his first public statements well enough: <br><blockquote>  <i>&quot;To come to the biggest club in Scotland is the biggest honour you can get.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br><b>2013-2014</b><br>Looking already aged beyond his years on his arrival (no surprise taking in what he had already been through in his personal life to date), his debut was an uncomfortable one as Celtic lost 2-1 in the Cup to a resurgent Aberdeen. It was Celtic&#39;s first defeat for months, but Leigh was not at fault. Subbed on late, he actually put in more effort in that match than most of the rest of the attack that day. Made up with it by scoring in his full Celtic Park debut (but then saw the goal chopped off). He finally scored in his next match v Hearts and he didn&#39;t half celebrate that moment, rubbing it into the Hearts fans (no surprise from the man who was always going to be a Hibbee at heart).<br><br>The critics had turned their volume down until it all he decided to blow it all up with that then characteristic piece of stupidity. Having only been at thr club for a short time, after scoring his first goal v Hearts, he ended up creating a fracas whilst back amongst old Hibs mates in a pub conducting a sing song of &#39;Rudi Skacel is a refugee&#39; (aimed at a Hearts player). Crude, offensive and against the tenants of our club. It was made clear to him in no uncertain terms from the general support that this was unacceptable, although some others were too easily forgiving. He really knew how to shoot himself in the foot. <br><br>Many of the Celtic support wanted him papped out, but the problem is that the club was a bit tight with any cashflow, and in fairness he was more stupid than anything. He wasn&#39;t advocating anything inflammatory but had to accept responsibility. He slowly did but could have done more quickly to dampen down some sections. What he ended up in the middle of was some crude boorish football fan behaviour, not some *** rally or NF meeting. Just idiotic football fans singing a daft song whose bark didn&#39;t even register. <br><br>At heart, he seemed to rather wish to be back at Hibs, which typically showed a lack of ambition and drive when considering that Hibs had been relegated to the second tier. It was unravelling for him but it was early days. Rumours after the summer 2014 transfer window continued that he was to go down the divisions on loan to Hibs (currently in the second tier), however he remained, and with his much talked about hair transplant, it was hoped he was to be a new player &amp; person.   <br><br>He continued to play in face of off-field trouble and finished the season with 7 goals in 13 league matches, which included a wonderful hat-trick against Inverness CT.<br><br><h3>Deila Era</h3><b>2014-2015</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Griffiths, Leigh - The Celtic Wiki" height="300" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/32f898ba93b4b10270223e7e0e75e2fb/GW300H300" title="Griffiths, Leigh - The Celtic Wiki" width="300"></h3>Griffiths started the season under new boss Ronny Deila playing right-wing against KR Reykjavik of Iceland, despite the 5-0 aggregate win he did not impress in this role. His first league goal of the season came against former club Dundee, rescuing a 1-1 draw. He would only score 2 Premiership goals in the first half of the campaign (against both Dundee clubs, and we won neither match!), although he did come off the bench to score twice in a 6-0 League Cup win over Partick Thistle.<br><br>During the first half of the season overall he played very little, mostly making sub appearances here and there, many believed he was on the way out of the club as he and a few others struggled to adapt to Ronny Deila&#39;s methods.<br><br>2015 had arrived and it seemed like a new dawn for Leigh, starting with a goal in the 4-0 win over Motherwell on the 21st of January, he went on a run of 4 goals in 5 games. This including the opening goal in a 2-0 win over Sevco in the League Cup semi-final at Hampden. If any match signalled a turn for the better then it was in this match. First ever meeting between the two, and Griffiths has the honour of having scored the inaugural goal. His emotions after scoring showed his pride, and his good performance conveyed that he was finally beginning to screw the nut. <br><br>In March he scored a crucial equaliser in the Scottish Cup against Dundee United and also scored in the replay, an easy 4-0 win. During a match against Kilmarnock in April  he came off the bench to score a sublime hat-trick with the game tied at 1-1 and repeated the feat 3 games later, scoring all 3 in a 3-0 win over Dundee United. His goal against Inverness on the final day of the season brought his tally to 20 and cemented his place as Celtic&#39;s top scorer for the season, a feat none thought possible 6 months previously.<br><br>If anything, the &#39;Rudi Skacel&#39; incident may have inadvertently become a blessing for Griffiths. After that farce he kept his head down, heeded the manager&#39;s words and knuckled down to training. Out of all of Deila&#39;s players he was the player who seemed to have progressed the furthest and the results were obvious in his physical conditioning and the results. The Skacel affair gave him a reason to cut many old ties with Hibs and the neanderthals in their support, and Celtic were to reap the rewards.<br><br>As his attitude improved the rewards came with it in goals and medals, but also the quality of his finishing too. It was a delight to see a reformed character succeed and reflected well on the club and the new management in particular. To have sold their initially criticised methods on to Griffiths with the results there for all to see was a major coup.<br><br>He hadn&#39;t lost his cheeky edge. Once when a sub in a match in April 2015, the cameras panned on him to find him sneakily taking out a Tunnocks Teacake and gobbling it out of sight the coaches. All laughed, and he earned a nickname of the Tunnocks Teacake Kid.<br><br>Despite his respectable return at domestic level, he was found to be less effective in European competition. He played 9 matches combined in Champions League qualifying and the Europa League, with a return of 0 goals, although he could be considered unfortunate against Romanian side Astra Giorgiou, after having what seemed a perfectly good goal ruled out. Potential grievances aside it just seemed like European football was just a level too far above Leigh Griffiths at this time, much like other forwards in the side, at 24 he had time on his side to improve however. <br><br><b>2015-16</b><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica">This was his season. A coming of age. <br> <br> Manager Ronny Deila was having a poor run, overseeing a Celtic side collapse in Europe, fail in the domestic cups and struggle to get over the line in the league. Yet if there were any positives then one of the very few was Griffiths who helped rescue Deila&#39;s bacon on many an occasion. If anything then he was carrying the team, something that was not expected from him. It was actually a disappointing season for Celtic in performances, but the first team still won the league and Griffiths was one of the heroes.<br> <br> Scoring 40 goals was way beyond anyone&#39;s expectations, and the quality and consistency was surprising, he had moved on from his earlier foibles and was now developing, and was one of the bulwarks to take Celtic to the league title. He was falling in love with Celtic and the support with him, but he was still a work in progress. <br> <br> Whilst his manager floundered, Griffiths grew. His quality of goals was high, his work rate was improving, and he was one of the few who seemed to actually benefit over the longer term from the input from the Deila coaching staff.<br><br>Deila also owed Griffiths much, and will look back on him fondly for his commitment that season.<br><br> The cherry on the cake was actually seeing his beloved Hibs side lift the Scottish Cup for the first time in 100 years over (Sevco) at the season side. You had to feel happy for him, he had matured (relatively) and was growing as a player.<br></font></font><br><br><h3>Brendan Rodgers Era<img align="right" alt="Griffiths, Leigh - The Celtic Wiki" height="250" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/6307560180c34d9db3b722b7b23a5e3c/GW250H250" title="Griffiths, Leigh - The Celtic Wiki" width="250"></h3><b>  2016-17 season</b><br>New manager and new era, and things were to change across the club but for the better in that the first team under Brendan Rodgers was to be revolutionised. <br><br>However, 2016-17 season was to be a difficult season for Griffiths as Moussa Dembele was brought in, and soon Dembele was to be the star man for the strikers role and few would have been able to challenge him. Dembele with all due respect was an exceptional player with potential world class quality.<br><br>Griffiths despite some irks from himself, still was a quality player when called on, and played a number of games. Gelled well in the new set-up, and new manager Brendan Rodgers had great faith in him. However, the manager did make it clear that players had to work harder, and many were taking it that he was talking about Griffiths as much as certain others. <br><br>Regardless of this, Leigh still had an exceptional record in the season capping it with a superb goal v TheRangers in a 5-1 win away and then scoring two exceptional free kicks against England for Scotland in a 2-2 draw for the World Cup qualifiers. <br><br>Rodgers remarked the following which showed some of the development that Griffiths still had to do :<br><blockquote><i>&quot;Players must be the very best they can be. Diet, nutrition &amp; a full time professional mindset. To be a CL Player you need to do this. Griffiths is part of my plans the next few years. Lot of Scottish players need to recognise self-improvement is what they must do&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>It was a golden season as Celtic went undefeated domestically and won the domestic treble, and were in the Champions League group stages. A lot to be proud of, and Griffiths was a part of all this and scored many goals of value which pushed the side on. <br><br>Sadly Scotland manager (and ex Celtic manager) Strachan was lax on selecting Griffiths, but when given the opportunity Griffiths took it with both hands. His greatest moment was v England in June 2017. With Scotland one down with ten minutes left, Griffiths scored two exceptional free kicks to give Scotland a 2-1 lead, only for England to frustratingly score an injury time equaliser. The quality of Griffiths should be remembered, and the pride all the viewing Celtic fans had of him rose tenfold.  <br><br><b><br></b><div><b>2017-18</b><br>Not as productive a season for Griffiths, but in fairness the first team had dipped after the stellar performances in the past season. Griffiths still scored a number of goals, but it was an underwhelming set of results compared to what he had previously achieved.<br> <br>A curious experience for Griffiths came against Linfield in July 2017. On taking a corner he was pelted with coins by their home support and then a half bottle of Buckfast. Next thing the referee booked him for pointing this out to him. All were bemused and the reporting of this went viral. Must have been a first in football like this. Booked for being attacked, and then Uefa charged him for provoking the crowd.    <br>He still managed to score v Sevco away in a 2-0 victory, and on a personal happy note he scored a double early on in the season v Hearts in a 4-1 victory. One key goal was scoring away in the Champions League to help Celtic finally win an away match in the Champions League group stages, 3-0 v Anderlecht. Celtic went on to make history with the back-to-back trebles, and he was all part of this. <br>    His return in goals again was vital, especially as Dembele seemed to have his eyes elsewhere whilst others were not at the top of their game. Griffiths was always working hard, could be better but his heart was here.   </div><br>The fact is  that Griffiths was home Celtic. His heart was at Celtic as much as it  would always have a place there for Hibs (admitting he couldn&#39;t  celebrate scoring against his boyhood heroes such as when Celtic defeated Hibs 1-0 in Jan 2018 courtesy of his winner).   <b><br></b><br><div></div><div></div><div><b>2018-19 (final Brendan Rodgers season)<br></b></div><div>  In season 2018/19, Griffiths seemed to be in &amp; out the side with injuries, and there were murmurs on his form. He grabbed some goals, including a stunning free kick in a 3-0 win over Hamilton in Nov 2018. However, he was then pulled in Dec 2018 from the first team and given period out to deal with personal ongoing problem, but he was to refute the allegations of any gambling or drug issues as was reported, and that it was personal mental health issues:<br>   <blockquote><i>&quot;Leigh will be out of football for a little period of time.

2014 <br><br>Celtic&#39;s pursuit of Leigh Griffiths seems to have created that classic convulsion among football fans, wherein the character of the player has sharply divided supporters. Griffiths is a gifted footballer, whose knack for dramatic, exciting goals is not in dispute, but whose other characteristics have left a lot to be desired.<br><br>Bringing morality into these debates is always a dodgy exercise, though it can hardly be outlawed. Fans of Celtic or any other club have a perfect right to voice their views on it.<br><br>One reason why many Sunderland fans objected to Paulo Di Canio&#39;s doomed arrival last season was because, on moral grounds, some detested his political views. It&#39;s as well they weren&#39;t told to clamp it and leave their pesky principles elsewhere.<br><br>In the case of Griffiths, there is much not to like, frankly. The striker has a history of unsavoury behaviour - of gestures, of at least one racist outburst, not to mention a chaotic, contemptibly selfish private life - which people find off-putting.<br><br>Then there is the story of Mick McCarthy, the Wolves manager who paid &pound;150,000 to sign Griffiths from Dundee in January 2011, but who immediately found him to be an unpleasant character, and had little time for him.<br><br>Griffiths has frequently been referred to as &quot;a ned&quot;, which is often a rash and unfair tag, though much of his activity has brought that upon himself. It seems beyond dispute that, in some areas, he could raise his level of human decency.<br><br>The counter-argument is this. Griffiths is still just 23 years old. He is a product, to some extent, of his background. He has plenty of growing up to do and, many attest, has sufficient character about him to do just that.<br><br>Last season, in at least one interview he gave following a Hibs match, Griffiths surprised many by talking openly and well, and in a way that belied the reputation that went before him.<br><br>Moreover, I can think of some footballers I know and admire today who, when I first met them in their early 20s, seemed little short of yobs. It is quite a testimony to football that it often makes better people of its workforce.<br><br>On the park, in my view, there is little to dispute about Griffiths&#39; ability. His skill and goalscoring have been there for all to see over the past five years.<br><br>Last season, during which he scored 28 goals in 42 outings for Hibs, Griffiths&#39; game was often thrilling. He scores all types of goals, not least the intermittent screamer. He also has that godsend for a centre-forward: he simply cannot stop believing in himself.<br><br>Peculiarly, despite being Wolves&#39; leading scorer at the turn of the year, Griffiths&#39; manager, Kenny Jackett, has omitted him from five of his last seven starting XIs. This has only proved to be a further, complicating factor in the Griffiths debate.<br><br>Jackett has targeted a number of new strikers, including Coventry City&#39;s Leon Clarke. His view of Griffiths appears to be that he is difficult to play in harness with someone, that his instincts are too erratic, too singular for the team collective.<br><br>It is an odd view, given the 13 goals that Griffiths had scored by Christmas, and the public hankering by many Wolves fans for Jackett to start playing the striker from the start. But none of this need be Celtic&#39;s concern.<br><br>On the basis of last season, there were grounds for Celtic trying to sign Griffiths last summer, but they chose not to. Now, however, Neil Lennon sees a new window of opportunity in getting the player.<br><br>Never mind the other aspects: could Griffiths make the step up from the English third tier to play for Celtic, domestically and in Europe? Yes, absolutely.<br><br>Gary Hooper went from Scunthorpe United to being a success at Celtic. Scott McDonald did likewise, having been a Southampton reject before finding himself again at Motherwell, and then at Parkhead.<br><br>Andrew Robertson is a current case of a player making quite a leap from Queen&#39;s Park to Dundee United, and is utterly thriving.<br><br>Football is littered with such examples. In many cases, talent and ability will out, no matter the level required. And in some scenarios - as the &quot;reject&quot; Henrik Larsson showed back in 1997 - the outcome can be astonishing.<br><br>Off the park, I&#39;ve been no admirer of Leigh Griffiths up to now. On it, I&#39;ve never doubted his fine ability. <br><br>My hunch is that, if he came to Celtic, and started scoring goals, this debate would swiftly cease.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic star Leigh Griffiths reveals his Scotland pals call him &lsquo;Postman Pat&rsquo; as he states he SHOULD be fine for Champions League tie against PSG</h3><div></div><div>The forward netted his third goal for his country before limping off late on with a calf knock &ndash; to give Hoops boss Brendan Rodgers a major scare</div><div class="spoiler_toggle"><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/1516364/celtic-leigh-griffiths-scotland-malta-psg-champions-league/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"><font color="#0066cc">https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/1516364/celtic-leigh-griffiths-scotland-malta-psg-champions-league/</font></a></div><div class="spoiler"></div><div class="spoiler">By David Friel Sep 2017<br><br>LEIGH GRIFFITHS has been labelled &lsquo;Postman Pat&rsquo; by his Scotland pals because he always delivers.<br>And the Celtic striker insists he&rsquo;ll be ready to produce against PSG in the Champions League &ndash; despite being crocked at Hampden.<br><br>Griff took his Scotland haul to three goals and three assists in three international games with another terrific display.<br>The No9 limped off late on with a calf knock &ndash; to give Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers a major scare.<br>But Griff claimed that was just a precaution and revealed he expects to be fit for next week&rsquo;s Euro clash with PSG.<br>He said: &ldquo;I got a wee kick on the back of my calf but it shouldn&rsquo;t be anything too serious and I should be fine for Hamilton on Friday.<br><br>&ldquo;Whether the manager wants to rest me or not is a different story, but I&rsquo;ll speak to the physio and then speak to the gaffer.<br>&ldquo;You obviously want to be available for Tuesday, so if the gaffer wants me to rest it on Friday night, then I&rsquo;ll need to do that.<br>&ldquo;It was good to get the goal and assist.

You can see the changes to my game.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made that lone striker role my own and I am relishing it.<br>&ldquo;You need to be disciplined to play that role. It&rsquo;s the same at Celtic and I can go and express myself.&rdquo;<br><br>Meanwhile, Griff WELCOMED the arrival of PSG loan star Odsonne Edouard as he faces up to more competition at Celtic.<br>He said: &ldquo;The gaffer has added good quality. We need that competition for places for the season going forward.<br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d be struggling otherwise. Moussa Dembele will be back soon and there will be three of us ready to push on and help us through the Champion League campaign.<br>&ldquo;It seems to be the case that either myself of Moussa has been injured and the other takes their chance.<br>&ldquo;I have the jersey just now and hopefully I can keep it. If not, you&rsquo;ve see what I&rsquo;ve done it the past.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for my chance on the sidelines and when I come I&rsquo;ll try to snatch it back.&rdquo;</div><div class="spoiler"></div><div class="spoiler"><iframe height="315" src="http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/kds/widget/genericvideo/bc4115b28134c5ff173e4c8214e4a90fdbeb5f0f" width="560"></iframe><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h3>  Celtic&rsquo;s Leigh Griffiths to take time out from football with &lsquo;ongoing issues&rsquo;</h3>Remaining Time -0:53<br>Patrick McPartlin<br>Published: 14:14 Wednesday 12 December 2018<br><br>Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths is to take a step back from football to deal with ongoing issues, Brendan Rodgers has revealed.<br><br>The Hoops boss confirmed the Scotland international had &ldquo;had ongoing issues for a number of months&rdquo; but would not discuss them, instead saying they were &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.<br><br>Rodgers added: &ldquo;Leigh will be out of football for a little period of time. He&rsquo;s had issues for a number of months and he&rsquo;s done amazing to get through and play to the level and score the goals that he has.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s reached a point where it&rsquo;s a struggle for him. We&rsquo;re going to give him all the professional help he possibly needs to get himself into a good place again and come back doing what he does best.<br><br>&ldquo;In order to do that, he needs to find a happiness. He&rsquo;s a father of five children and he&rsquo;s a great guy, but football and life is tough for him. We want to help him with that so he&rsquo;ll be out of football for a period of time.&rdquo;<br><br>Revealing that he had a good relationship with the former Wolves and Hibs forward, Rodgers continued: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been ongoing in my time here with Leigh. I&rsquo;m very close with him and he&rsquo;s had a number of issues outside the football environment. &ldquo;Thankfully for him, nowadays the issues that can come across young people in general have a lot of professional support. We&rsquo;ll seek professional help, there&rsquo;ll be an assessment of where he&rsquo;s at and then a plan in place to move forward.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a concern over a considerable period of time. There&rsquo;s bouts of stability, but too regularly it&rsquo;s not. This is a sport now where there&rsquo;s so much focus and attention on you.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no longer a weakness now to talk. The most important thing for managers and coaches is the welfare of players.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not easy, especially in this profession. It&rsquo;s clear that he needs order in his life in order for him to show the great talent that he has. His welfare is something that&rsquo;s of the upmost importance for us.<br><br>&ldquo;We can help people and that&rsquo;s something we aim to do with him. He has all the support of the staff and players and supporters to help him get back to a good place. He&rsquo;s a great guy who just needs some help.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s still very young in his career. What&rsquo;s most important is we get him right and rebuild his mind and get him to a good place. If you&rsquo;re happy and have the energy then you can do your very best as a footballer because he&rsquo;s clearly a talent and a very big talent.  &ldquo;First and foremost, forget football. Think of the young guy as a human being and we&rsquo;ll take it from there.&rdquo;<br><br>The 28-year-old has played 22 times for the champions this campaign, but has struggled with injury.<br>Hearts forward Steven Naismith was on hand for the Loaves and Fishes Christmas charity lunch, which he again funded for homeless people in Glasgow.
