So I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing him work and play with us.&rdquo;<br></i></blockquote><br>  Brendan Rodgers debut season was a dream, and for any player who was rewarded by being drafted into it at the time, it was like a prized gift. Rodgers had already a fair record with transfers in &amp; out in his initial run, and into this arrived Gamboa. It wasn&#39;t easy going for the new arrival, and in retrospect was deemed to be the first failed transfer in of a player under Rodgers. <br> <br> A speedy little player, Gamboa was brought in as a defensive player able to flit in between a full-back role and midfield. With Celtic in the Champions League, a flexible squad was needed, and as Celtic had recent history of injured and often underperforming full-backs, it gave Gamboa a chance that he could manage a decent number of games to prove himself.<br> <br> A nightmare start when he started for Celtic against Barcelona in the Champions League in a 7-0 defeat. He looked out of his depth and awkward, and was no proper introduction to the first team. No one was to hold it against him, and a restart was needed. <br> <br> He was to go on to play intermittently in the season, and there was little to write home about and most would put him as being a secondary choice for the first team. There were no travesty performances but nothing necessarily outstanding either, and with Celtic striving on to the treble, the first team players were on form and actually playing better than expected. Various players and not just Gamboa were left out in the cold with opportunities few, finding it difficult to break in. <br> <br> To Gamboa&#39;s possible disbelief, Celtic&#39;s full-backs went on to have a great season giving Gamboa little room to prove himself better than what was already in hand. Lustig who had a poor reputation for being out injured repeatedly, actually played his greatest number of games in a season since he started, with many fine performances and was given credit widely. The other full-back on the left was Tierney who at this point was a precocious talent, and Izzaguire was the ideal makeshift for Tierney when needed. In midfield, there was little chance for Gamboa as Celtic were already spoilt for choice with an oversupply of quality players.<br> <br> Rodgers had some faith and provided him the a number of opportunities, but few were convinced of his long-term chances at Celtic in this squad. Maybe if he had arrived a year earlier when Celtic were underperforming he&#39;d have been given a greater chance, but not at this time when Celtic were on a high.<br> <br> Into the following season (2017-18) even with defensive injuries, Gamboa was hardly used or referenced. The writing was on the wall it seemed, and he was to play a passive &amp; mostly absent role in the incredible back-to-back treble winning season.<br> <br> Unfortunately when drafted in against Bayern away to cover for injuries, he was up against a world class player and it showed but he gave his all. It was too tough an ask, not aided by Lustig moving to central defence where he had little proven himself.<br> <br>Even though it was quite late on, his Celtic career needed a restart..... <br><br><div></div><div><h3>Post-2018 World Cup</h3></div>It is a curious irony that Gamboa was so far back in the line for a first team place for Celtic yet was to be one of the few that was heading to the World Cup in Russia for 2018, regardless of that it was for Costa Rica. Another measure for highlighting the true paucity of the international scene some would argue.In fairness, Costa Rica didn&#39;t disgrace themselves in what was actually a tough group, and actually held out a very highly talented Brazil side for 90mins till two late goals killed the game off, and Gamboa did a very good job against Brazilian star Neymar who was then the world&#39;s most expensive player (albeit not the highest regarded or respected).<br><br>He next won a quick return to the Celtic team as fellow teammate Lustig was rested due to a longer World Cup spell, and Gamboa earned good reviews for his turn v Rosenborg in the vital Champions League qualifiers.<br><br>Gamboa had the opportunity to slot into Lustig&#39;s role, especially as he was now declining with age, but was it that Gamboa couldn&#39;t or wouldn&#39;t? Had Gamboa burnt his bridges with the <span class="diffRemove">management.</span><span class="diffAdd">management or just been poorly treated?</span> <br><br>He was finally praised by the support following a good performance v Partick in Aug 2018 in the league cup in a 3-1 win, but despite some fine performances, Rodgers still wouldn&#39;t play him regularly. Even though Lustig&#39;s form was faltering fast, with loud calls from the support about his declining form, again Rodgers still wouldn&#39;t bring Gamboa in. It was clear there was an issue somewhere, and the writing was on the wall.<br><br>Toljan was brought in on loan from Germany for the right-back role to the end of the season, and it sealed the fate for Gamboa that he was fully frozen by the management for the first team. This wa
