I was 6 years old and my Grandfather had taken me  into Celtic Park for the first time, and the sights, sounds and smells  I&rsquo;ll remember until my dying day.<br><br>The excitement had been  building inside me since midweek, when I was told I would be going to  see the team I had followed for as long as I could remember and when we  got out of my Granda&rsquo;s pal&rsquo;s car and started to walk up to Parkhead  cross I thought I would burst with excitement and apprehension. There  weren&rsquo;t many fans about due to my chaperone&rsquo;s habit of getting into the  ground at 2pm and taking up their usual position &ndash; slightly left of the  halfway line, just about halfway up the terracing, second crush barrier  in. This was to be my station for the next 6 years of my life, every  time Celtic were at home.<br><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" height="335" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/L-wCjXCYFVbqn4dKGSZQ6g29773/GW577H335" title="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" width="577"><br><i>  The Jungle from the Rangers End  </i></div><br><br>The  next thing I noticed, as we walked along underneath the terracing to  our spot, was the smell. There were 3 different smells competing to  outdo each other for my attention. Urine, from the prehistoric toilets,  just about masked the sweet odour of cigar smoke, which in turn covered  up the smell of horse dung from the huge Police horses. We hurried on.<br><br>As  we emerged into the terracing itself, I couldn&rsquo;t believe how big the  place looked. It was huge. Concrete seemed to be all around, and the  park looked impossibly green and lush. The corrugated iron roof which  covered the place looked to be thousands of feet above me and each end  of the park was miles away. I felt so small. I was so small!<br><br>I was  allowed to get a macaroon bar from the vendor and sat on the barrier  happily munching away while my Granda and his mate George debated  whatever it was that was going on in the world that day and more than  likely arguing about who should be in the team. I think we were playing  Aberdeen that day. For all I can recall most other things about it, I  can&rsquo;t seem to be sure if it was though. I think we won &ndash; a memorable  occasion in the days of Fergie&rsquo;s Aberdeen &ndash; but I&rsquo;m not even sure about  that. The occasion must have gone to my head! I sat watching the ground  fill up and the songs and chants start and thought, &ldquo;This will do for  me&rdquo;. I felt, even at that age, the pull of the Celtic family.<br><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" height="293" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/MDYo1E2gaAOpLU-dO-QvHA20495/GW388H293" title="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" width="388"></div><div align="center"><i>Joe Miller in front of The Jungle</i></div><br>As  I got older, I started playing football on Saturday mornings for my  school team, but even as I was playing I would be thinking of meeting my  Granda and going to watch the Hoops. It was a ritual. Finish playing,  quick shower, walk to my Granda&rsquo;s, something to eat (usually sausage  roll and beans &ndash; to this day one of my favourites), and picked up by  George at 1:30pm. One school game I remember vividly was a Cup Final in  which we were horsed 7-1. I was in tears but my Granda told me to cheer  up, that Celtic would win 7-1 against St. Mirren that day. &ldquo;Aye, right&rdquo;,  I said to myself, &ldquo;Like that&rsquo;s going to happen.&quot; I&rsquo;ve actually just  checked on this site and the date was 24th November, 1984. Scoreline?  Celtic 7 St. Mirren 1. Unbelievable!<br><br><div align="center"><img align="bottom" alt="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" height="308" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/sfmgmf2l3wfeXH7NOJAdBg17449/GW574H308" title="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" width="574"></div><div align="center"><i>Basle 1969</i></div><br><br>I  grew older and, as much as I loved going with my Granda, I flew the  nest and joined a Supporters Bus. Going to the Jungle with my mates was  the ultimate buzz. We started off down the front, just beside the  Rangers end, where we would try to start the singing and were ecstatic  if even a small crowd joined in. We then progressed &ndash; some would say  graduated, to the back of the Jungle to what my Granda always  enigmatically called &lsquo;The Glee Club&rsquo;. I think I now know why. You could  smell &lsquo;the Glee&rsquo; off that particular area from 100 feet! It was  brilliant though. Most songs were started from there and we really felt  part of something. At some points you would feel as if the life was  being squeezed from you, so tightly were you packed in, then suddenly,  as the crowd reacted to an incident on the pitch, you would find  yourself with a space all around you as the crowd swayed backwards and  forwards. Just as suddenly you could find yourself carried away by a  surge and have to fight your way back to find your mates. Great fun! The  character the whole Jungle had was unbelievable; I don&rsquo;t think I can do  it justice with mere words. Tribal is probably as close as I could get.  I&rsquo;m sure the BBC commentators, who would be perched precariously on the  long gangway high above the Jungle would agree!<br><br><br><div align="center"><i><img align="bottom" alt="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" height="395" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/2UZtpbXGdzlz-KnXjnDtXA26477/GW575H395" title="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" width="575"><br>The Grandest Team Of Them All in front of The Jungle.</i></div><br>I  watched some great players from the Jungle. McLeod, Provan, Burns,  McStay, McClair, Nicholas, McGarvey etc. My favourite though was Danny  McGrain. Nowadays you&rsquo;ll hear fans decrying just about every player at  some point. I don&rsquo;t think I ever heard anyone in the Jungle moan at  Danny. He was outstanding, truly world class and a Celtic legend. I feel  privileged to have seen him. I also have seen some wonderful games,  from the sublime &ndash; The St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day massacre against the huns in  1991 and the following weeks destruction of them again, to the  ridiculous &ndash; the Rapid Vienna affair. I was actually only yards away  from where the bottle was thrown and can remember the &lsquo;Hooli, hooli,  hooligan&rsquo; chant going up as the Rapid player writhed around as if he&rsquo;d  been hit by a train. The subsequent footage showing that the bottle  missed him by yards didn&rsquo;t convince UEFA though, and the result was null  and void. The replay at Old Trafford was midweek and I wasn&rsquo;t allowed  to go. Celtic went out, and to this day I have an intense dislike of  that team. I was so glad when Everton beat them in that year&rsquo;s final. I  watched Celtic destroy some teams &ndash; Hamilton were beaten 8-3, with Alan  McInally scoring 4 &ndash; and get beaten by mediocre teams who shouldn&rsquo;t have  been on the same park. It was all part of the Celtic experience and the  lows were balanced out by the euphoric high we all got when we won.<br><br><br><div align="center"><i><img align="bottom" alt="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" height="309" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/JNvjuVaitjXzbAvHuZG_1Q21014/GW572H309" title="Welcome To The Jungle - Kerrydale Street" width="572"><br>Out of the ashes, t</i><i>he new North Stand takes shape.</i></div><br><br>The  tragedies at Hillsborough, Bradford and Heysel necessitated a change in  football stadia in Britain. The Justice Taylor Report called for all  seated stadia and clubs were powerless to resist. The change has brought  a lot of positives; grounds are a lot more comfortable, there are  better catering facilities, the views are undeniably better &ndash; bad luck  in the old days if a 6&rsquo; 4&rdquo; guy came in and stood in front of you at  kick-off! &ndash; and there are a lot more families and young children going  to games. And the smell from the toilets isn&rsquo;t quite as bad! I can&rsquo;t  help feeling though that a lot of the spirit, the camaraderie and the  passion has gone out of the game. It&rsquo;s noticeable at all but a few games  at the new (colossal and fantastic, it has to be said) Celtic Park,  although we can still raise the roof like no-one else when we want to. <br><br>In  June 1993 I was working in a bingo hall about a mile from Celtic Park.  My Granda had collapsed at his usual spot in the Jungle the year before,  at a game against Dunfermline, and three weeks later died in hospital.  On the day he collapsed we lost and for the next three weeks we didn&rsquo;t  win a game. Just before he passed away we won. I like to think he was  holding out for a victory. The Jungle was to follow my Granda into  history and a game was arranged to bring down the curtain on a terrace  to rival &ndash; and in my opinion beat into a cocked hat &ndash; any in world  football. You can keep your Kop, the Stretford End, and the Curvas of  Italian football. The Jungle reigned supreme. My boss in the bingo was  adamant that I wasn&rsquo;t getting the night off and I turned up for work  that day hoping to get him to change his mind. No luck, he wasn&rsquo;t for  letting me go. As kick off approached I made my decision. What was it to  be? Stay in this crappy job or honour the place which had been a home  to me for a huge part of my youth? As I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll have figured out,  there was no contest. I walked out and along the Gallowgate to the  ground which still holds some of my best memories.
