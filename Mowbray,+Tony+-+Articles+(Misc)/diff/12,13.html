I knew that they were a big Club with an illustrious history; the first British team to win the European Cup, and to achieve the amazing feat of winning nine championships in a row.<br><br><br>When I was an apprentice professional footballer at Middlesbrough in the 1980, my youth team coach would eulogise about Celtic and the great players who had played for the Club. The coach in question was indeed one of the very best ex -Celts; his name Bobby Murdoch.<br><br>By the time I left Celtic on 1995, the Club and more importantly the supporters, had left an indelible mark in my heart, which will never leave me.<br><br>I feel honoured to have played in &quot;the hoops&quot; and to have given my all for the Club at very difficult period in the Clubs history. It was a volatile time in the East end of Glasgow what with the &quot;sack the board&quot; campaign and the domination of the field of the team from across the city. It was a time of change at Celtic, but what stood firm throughout all of my time at the Club was the belief the supporters had that good times were just around the corner and that the Celts would be &quot;singing in the sun&quot; before too long. <br><br>Their support of the team on the field was total and the players strived to reward the fans with performances that made you feel as if you were part of a huge family unit - and that feeling of being as one with the supporters could not of been highlighted more than when I was to lose my wife to cancer on new years day 1995. At a time when my life was decimated, and I was as low as any human being can get, the love and warmth I will never forget. Words of support poured in from Celtic folk, from all over the world and at a time when my life was empty, they helped fill that void with their compassion.<br><br>So as I said earlier, Celtic will always be &#39;my club&#39; and I feel very humble that I played alongside such great Celts as McStay, Nicholas. Collins, Grant, Bonner and many more, but most importantly that I know whenever I pulled on the Jersey, I gave my all because I knew what it meant to the supporter on the terraces, to be proud to be a Celt.<br><br>Take care and God Bless,<br><br>Tony Mowbray Hail, Hail FIRST TEAM COACH (Ipswich Town)<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Tony Mowbray&#39;s open letter to celtic supporters (June 09)<br></h3><br>I am absolutely delighted to be back at Celtic and it&rsquo;s a great honour for me to have been appointed manager of this football club.<br><br>The four years I spent here as a player were very important to me and if I didn&rsquo;t arrive as a Celtic supporter, I certainly left as one. In particular, the backing I received throughout my time at the club from supporters, in the good times and in the bad, is something that I really appreciated and have never forgotten.<br><br>Celtic is more than a football club and all of us who support the team help to make it a special institution.<br><br>It is also a tremendous challenge to become Celtic manager but it is one that I am relishing. I am looking forward to meeting up with the players and working with them as we set our sights on bringing success to the club, and it&rsquo;s going to be an exciting challenge for all of us.<br><br>Celtic Park is a famous stadium in football. I was lucky enough to play here when it was the old ground, before it was transformed into the impressive arena it is today, and it&rsquo;s a wonderful privilege for each and every player to be able to run out for a home game in front of 60,000 supporters.<br><br>Any success that Celtic have ever achieved or will achieve in the seasons to come is down to everyone being united. That means the players will give everything on the field, the management will work tirelessly to make sure the squad is properly prepared for each and every game, and the supporters will give their legendary backing to the team.<br><br>We are all Celtic supporters, faithful through and through, and together we can bring further success to our football club.<br><br>So I am delighted to be back here. As i say, it is an honour and a privilege to be the manager of Celtic Football Club, and I want you all to be here with me and the team for what I am sure will be an exciting new season.<br><br>Tony Mowbray<br>Manager<br>Celtic Football Club<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Tony Mowbray confirmed as Celtic manager  	       </h3><div> <div class="article-author"> 	  Times Online<br>(June 09)</div> </div>        <div> <div>    Tony Mowbray has been appointed Celtic manager, the club have confirmed. <br><br>  The former West Bromwich Albion manager will bring assistant Mark Venus and  first-team coach Peter Grant with him from The Hawthorns and Neil Lennon,  the current Celtic coach, will also join the new management team. <br><br>  Mowbray will be unveiled at a press conference at Celtic Park tomorrow morning  and his appointment finally brings to an end weeks of speculation about who  would succeed Gordon Strachan, who departed after failing to win his fourth  Clydesdale Bank Premier League title in succession. <br><br>  Jeremy Peace, the West Brom chairman, reluctantly allowed the Old Firm club to  speak to Mowbray on Saturday after they agreed to pay &pound;2million in  compensation for the former Celtic defender. Lennon, who was part of  Strachan&#39;s coaching team, was promised a role at Parkhead for next season by  Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell.<br> There has been speculation that Lennon would take over as reserve team coach  from Willie McStay, but his job will become clearer at tomorrow&#39;s press  conference. <br><br>  Mowbray&#39;s first job will be to assess his squad ahead of the first of possibly  two tricky Champions League qualifiers at the end of July. With the league  fixtures being announced tomorrow, Mowbray will discover who will be his  first opponents in the league campaign.    Mowbray will need no introduction to Scott Brown, Gary Caldwell and Chris  Killen, all of whom were under his charge when he was Hibernian manager. <br><br>  However, Mowbray will have to address several areas in the side and has  already been linked with numerous players including Paul Robinson, the West  Brom defender, Marc-Antoine Fortune, the Nancy striker, Portsmouth defender  Hermann Hreidarsson and Mattias Bjarsmyr, the Sweden Under-21 captain.</div></div><div class="Title"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br> <h3>Mowbray will have to hit the ground running at Celtic</h3></div> <div class="Provided"> <div>16 June 2009</div>Provided by: <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=%22GPW:GRULTD%5Cs%22" target="_self">Guardian  Unlimited</a></div><br><div class="LeadPara">Ewan Murray: Tony Mowbray is well-placed to deliver the  free-flowing football Celtic fans desire, but faces uncharted waters at  Parkhead</div> <div class="LeadPara"><br>Forming a character assessment of Tony Mowbray is a  troublesome business. Publicly, at least, he gives little away. His natural  shyness can and often is mistaken for arrogance, an unwillingness to open up  perhaps partly a resonance of the tragedy he suffered while a Celtic  player.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Yet there is an underlying sense of humour, an ability to  relate to football players and an unquestionable work ethic within Mowbray the  manager. When in charge of Hibernian, he said to me only partly in jest that &quot;as  a big ugly bloke with a face like this, I get used to people looking at me in  the street; I just try to keep my head down&quot;.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Anonymity is not an option when you are in charge of  Celtic. Albeit Mowbray has just left a season in England&#39;s Premier League behind  him, he has walked into a role where his every move, tactic and pound spent will  be analysed as never before.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>More significantly, he must deal with a scenario where  expectations are higher than he has ever encountered ? as a manager, that is;  Mowbray should be well aware from the four years he spent as a Celtic player  just how much success counts and defeat hurts for both halves of the Old Firm.  Between 1991 and 1995, after all, Rangers were cantering towards nine titles in  a row.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>In general terms, Mowbray was a success during almost two  and a half years at Hibs. Two top-four finishes in the SPL were secured  although, in fairness, the talent at the manager&#39;s disposal meant that should  have been the case. Many of those players ? Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson, Steven  Whittaker among them ? departed Easter Road for hefty transfer fees thereafter.  Mowbray also arguably left Edinburgh at the right time for West Bromwich Albion,  Hibs enduring a below-par opening to season 2006-07.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>There were obvious positives, though. Hibs gained a  reputation as a free-flowing, fine footballing side with Mowbray in charge.  Since he departed, supporters have regularly bemoaned the absence of such style.  Mowbray&#39;s Hibs developed a penchant for defeating Rangers, most memorably by  three goals to nil at Ibrox in a Scottish Cup tie in February 2006. Either in  victory or defeat, Mowbray&#39;s honest descriptions of matches in their immediate  aftermath impressed many onlookers.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>West Brom has subsequently been a bittersweet experience  for the man who, because of his earlier affiliation to that club, has been  regularly tipped as a future Middlesbrough manager. Achieving promotion from the  Championship is no mean feat in anyone&#39;s language, while demotion back there  given the budget at his disposal was hardly unexpected.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Only Hawthorns regulars could fully explain why Mowbray was  still afforded a rousing reception as last season closed considering the points  and goals against columns; the style of play on offer, again, seems the most  widely held view. The manager plucked the odd cheap gem from the transfer  market, Graham Dorrans among them, and never seemed willing to enter into media  hubris; something that will endear him to his new employers.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Mowbray has appeared Celtic&#39;s most viable and attainable  option from the day it was confirmed that Gordon Strachan had decided four years  in Glasgow was quite enough.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>He is the man who started Celtic&#39;s pre-match huddle, has  frequently spoken of his fondness for the club and their supporters and there  will be an obvious emotional pull towards Parkhead. Mowbray showed tremendous  dignity in coping with the death of his former wife when a Celtic player;  Bernadette&#39;s family were and are all staunch supporters of the Hoops.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Fiscal realities mean Celtic cannot shop at the top end of  the managerial market as they did when Martin O&#39;Neill was appointed or,  previously, when they courted Guus Hiddink. That is not an excuse for the club&#39;s  board, who seem to have procrastinated unnecessarily in agreeing compensation to  the value of merely a competent centre-forward, but a basic fact.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Mowbray&#39;s first challenge may be his biggest. Two sets of  qualifying matches for the Champions League will open Celtic&#39;s season. Strachan  found out only too well that defeat at stage one can have massive implications:  many fans simply never took to him after that Artmedia Bratislava disaster. In  more basic terms, the fact that Rangers have secured automatic entry to the  group phase means Celtic have to do likewise to ensure financial parity for a  season at least. The new manager, of course, is inexperienced in such a  scenario.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>There is plenty of romanticised nonsense spoken about  playing football &quot;the Celtic way&quot;. That is, as if the club have some historical  monopoly on an attractive version of the game.

I am a miserable sod. At least, that&#39;s the way I am perceived.&#39;<br><br>  There are at least two serious sides to Tony Mowbray, born perhaps out of working-class hardship in the North East and the tragedy that scarred his life. Mowbray greatly values his precious time with his loving wife Amber and young children Lucas and Max, yet he freely acknowledges the effect on him of the death from breast cancer of his first wife 13 years ago. Bernadette, from Glasgow, was only 26 when she died in his arms on New Year&#39;s Day. The couple had been married only eight months, a painful period documented movingly in his celebrated cathartic book, Kissed By An Angel.  The wedding ceremony took place on April 3, 1994 and, even in the midst of preparations for Saturday&#39;s FA Cup semi-final against Portsmouth, Mowbray took time out privately to mark the anniversary yesterday. Of all days, Bernadette would have been 39 on Saturday. <br><br>&#39;Please, please, don&#39;t make this out as if I want to win the Cup for Bernadette. That would not be the case and it would be so disrespectful to Amber and the kids,&#39; he says. &#39;Going through an experience like that undoubtedly impacted on my thinking and my way of life. It has given me a certain perspective. I don&#39;t get too uptight with my team. I don&#39;t throw teacups, for example.&#39;<br><br>It was different in his playing days. &#39;I could never socialise after defeats. I would lock myself away. The hurt of losing as a player was much greater before I lost my wife, which happened late in my career. &#39;As a manager now, defeat can still spoil my weekend. But I have learned to try to look at the bigger picture. Are we moving in the right direction? Is the team playing the way we want them to? Are we entertaining? Over the longer term will we win more games? I don&#39;t get too stuck on a bad result.&#39; Mowbray feels the answer to the above questions, in relation to West Bromwich Albion, will still be &#39;yes&#39; even if they lose to Portsmouth and fail to go up to the Barclays Premier League. Baggies fans might find such a disappointing combination a little harder to swallow. While recoiling at suggestions of being an idealist, Mowbray has his sights on loftier goals than the top division or the top of an open-topped bus. &#39;I want other people to look and think &iquest;aesthetically, I like watching West Brom&iquest;,&#39; he says. &#39;As a coach at Ipswich I would go and watch every Arsenal Champions League game. <br><br>I would get on the train, go to London and marvel at what they do. All they are doing is passing the ball 10 yards to each other but it is poetry. &#39;Watching this machine move the ball around, so fluent and effortless, Freddie Ljungberg coming in off the left, Robert Pires drifting past people. Just beautiful to watch. They do not do anything but pass to team-mates in better positions. Simplicity is genius. This is what I want my players to do.&#39; A lack of a smile does not mean a lack of passion. Mowbray has been &#39;Mogga&#39; to his friends since childhood but Bruce Rioch, the manager who made him Middlesbrough&#39;s captain at 22 and introduced him to patterns of play, once called him Zeus. Rioch thought his spiky-haired, blond-highlighted, bronzed skipper returning from a summer holiday looked like a Greek god. He was obviously a fan. <br><br>He famously identified Mowbray as the man he would want at his side on a lunar rocket, a compliment which led to Boro fans entitling their fanzine Fly Me to the Moon. Middlesbrough supporters, for whom Mowbray achieved heroic status, used to joke that when Manchester United bought Gary Pallister in 1989 for a record British transfer fee of &pound;2.3m, they got the wrong central defender. &#39;I remember that. Was it a joke? I am still good friends with Pally. I speak to him quite regularly,&#39; says Mowbray. &#39;He was a fantastic footballer. I could not match his pace and strength. He was a man-mountain, Bambi on ice initially and then a monster of a guy. As he was learning the game, I was his Steve Bruce of the Man U period &iquest; a voice, an organiser, a motivator, getting the best out of his talents.&#39; Mowbray, the player, acquired a reputation as an uncompromising stopper who would take bullets for the cause. Yet, he had been a goal-scoring midfield player in his youth. <br><br>&#39;Your talent can get suppressed, I think. Because I was 6ft 2in I was put to the back. You are told to get your head on it and clear your lines. You are a defender. &#39;Up until 15 and 16 I had been scoring plenty of goals. I was a linchpin in midfield, getting the ball and spraying it about, beating people, making things happen. The bigger picture prevailed. I took on the responsibility for the team,&#39; he recalls. <br><br>&#39;Who knows if that centre half ever given the licence could have operated in centre midfield, painting pictures, seeing things round the corner, flicking the ball with his boot, joining in a one-two? &#39;In my mind I knew all the moves. I got patterned into destroying and heading the first ball, getting first contact in the box, heading goalkicks back into the opposition half.&#39; If Mowbray sounds like a frustrated playmaker, that&#39;s because he is. &#39;It is part of the reason I want my players to express themselves really. My centre halves at some time in their lives have probably been the best players on the pitch, at school or for their district. It is trying to bring that out, encouraging them to play and pass,&#39; he adds. There is a second irony here, though. West Bromwich Albion&#39;s current weakness is in the area where he personally was strongest. <br><br>Like Arsenal, the Baggies have been labelled something of a soft touch, fragile away from home, conceding goals from set-pieces, perhaps defensively not the most resolute. Mowbray nods. &#39;I am probably harsh on my central defenders because we do lose goals that teams do not have to work hard for. We are not good enough at getting first contact on balls coming into our box.&#39; Mowbray, the manager, at 44 young and aspirational, has in his short career established a reputation for sending out teams which entertain. <br><br>The destroyer has become the creator. Hibs were indisputably the most attractive side in Scotland during his two years there, winning three times at Ibrox and also at Celtic yet &iquest; and this may be significant with tomorrow in mind &iquest; losing two Cup semi-finals. It is not only who he is. It is also where he has been. He spent nine years as player and coach at Ipswich, a club steeped in attacking, passing football. There were also four years at Celtic, where all-out attack has always been the imperative &iquest; even during the so-called &#39;barren years&#39; with which his time there coincided. The Huddle, now universal in many sports, was his great legacy. &#39;I don&#39;t like to put a patent on it. But I take a great sense of pride in it. It was nothing to do with my wife, as has been wrongly reported. It came out of adversity. <br><br>The Celtic players needed to show real unity and togetherness. We needed to show the supporters we cared.&#39; Which was precisely why the manager initiated its first Albion manifestation after the draw at Charlton last month. That kind of attitude could take West Bromwich Albion to a Wembley final, 18 years after Mowbray last led a team out there. Colin Todd, who had just taken over from Rioch at Middlesbrough, insisted that Mowbray, sidelined during the week through injury, should don a blazer and lead out the team alongside Chelsea manager Bobby Campbell in the Zenith Data Systems Cup Final. He was smiling then. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Mowbray promises evolution, not revolution</h3> <div class="Provided"> <div>17 June 2009</div>Provided by: The Irish  Examiner</div><div class="LeadPara"><br>New Celtic boss Tony Mowbray has assured Hoops players he  will not be taking a &quot;big axe&quot; to the Parkhead squad.</div> <div class="LeadPara"><br>Mowbray met the media at Celtic Park this morning after  being confirmed as Gordon Strachan&rsquo;s successor and he outlined his plans for the  future.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Celtic fans will hope to see some changes in the squad that  lost the Clydesdale Bank Premier League title to Rangers last season and a host  of players have already been linked with moving in and out of the club in recent  weeks.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Mowbray, who claimed he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with the budget  handed to him by chief executive Peter Lawwell, is tasked with bringing flair  back to the Parkhead side which, according to many supporters, was missing under  Strachan.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>However, the former Celtic defender, who will be joined by  his assistant Mark Venus and former Hoops team-mate Peter Grant as coach, warned  there will be evolution rather than revolution in the east end of Glasgow.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;I&rsquo;m not coming here with a big axe to swing and cut  everything out,&quot; Mowbray said.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;I don&rsquo;t want to sit here and say we need a new player in  this position or that position.

The 46-year-old&#39;s exit followed Wednesday night&#39;s 4-0 Clydesdale  Bank Premier League thrashing at St Mirren, which left the Hoops 10  points behind arch-rivals Rangers having played two games more. It is believed Mowbray met chief executive Peter Lawwell at  Celtic&#39;s Lennoxtown training ground on Thursday when the decision was  taken to end his short tenure. Assistant manager Mark Venus and Peter Grant have also  lost their jobs, with Neil Lennon appointed interim manager. Chairman John Reid said: &quot;On behalf of the board and everyone at  Celtic Football Club, I would like to offer Tony Mowbray my thanks and  sincere best wishes for the future. &quot;Tony is held in great affection by Celtic fans and it is  obviously with great disappointment that we make today&#39;s statement. &quot;During his period here, Tony has always acted with great dignity  as he has done today. &quot;We are all Celtic supporters, faithful through and through, Tony  included. &quot;We are all disappointed at the way things have gone this season. &quot;However, as supporters, we will collectively build again to  re-establish the club to its pre-eminent position within Scottish  football.&quot; Chief executive Peter Lawwell added: &quot;This is a very sad day for  everyone at Celtic. &quot;Tony is a very fine man and someone who I know is passionate  about the club he served so well as a player. &quot;Clearly, we have had a difficult season and results have not  been as we would have hoped. &quot;Tony is equally disappointed at some of our results this season  but, working so closely with him, I know that throughout his period as  manager he has always given the club his total and absolute commitment. &quot;Tony will always maintain a strong affection for Celtic and I am  sure he will always be highly thought of within the Celtic family. He  is a man who demonstrates decency and integrity in everything he does. &quot;I have enjoyed an excellent relationship with him and I  certainly wish Tony, Mark Venus and Peter Grant all the very best for  the future.&quot; Wednesday&#39;s defeat was the 13th of Mowbray&#39;s reign after  he succeeded Gordon Strachan in the summer. Mowbray joined from West Brom, who reportedly secured around  &pound;2million in compensation for his services. However, the former Hibernian manager was not Celtic&#39;s first  choice, with Owen Coyle turning the job down and Roberto Martinez also  reportedly approached. Mowbray was charged with bringing an attractive brand of football  to Parkhead, which fans felt was lacking towards the end of Strachan&#39;s  reign. The new manager suffered an early setback when Celtic lost the  first leg of their Champions League third qualifying round match to  Dinamo Moscow. They bounced back in the second leg to set up a play-off round  tie with Arsenal but were thrashed 5-1 on aggregate. Things initially went well in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League  but Celtic&#39;s Europa League campaign never recovered from an early  setback and they crashed out of the competition before the end of the  group stage. Their SPL campaign began to unravel after they lost the first Old  Firm derby of the season at Ibrox. They tossed away leads in a series of games as defensive frailty  began to undermine their title bid, while they also crashed out of the  Co-operative Insurance Cup at home to Hearts. By January, they were seven points adrift in the SPL and Mowbray  set about dismantling the squad, bringing in eight new players during  the transfer window. The shock arrival of Robbie Keane on loan from Tottenham was  greeted by thousands of jubilant fans on transfer deadline day. But the Republic of Ireland international&#39;s debut summed up  Mowbray&#39;s reign, Celtic losing at Kilmarnock for the first time in nine  years. Keane&#39;s goals almost single-handedly won Celtic games in both the  SPL and Active Nation Scottish Cup but he could not prevent them  slipping 10 points behind Rangers following last month&#39;s third Old Firm  derby of the season. Despite results, Mowbray repeatedly refused to deviate from his  passing principles but last night witnessed the first admission that his  football philosophy was perhaps not suited to the Scottish game. But he also could not resist a dig at Rangers in the process,  telling BBC Scotland: &quot;Rangers have been very consistent - they haven&#39;t  lost four goals in any game. &quot;They set up differently - maybe that&#39;s the way to go. &quot;Maybe it isn&#39;t a league for trying to force the game and be  expansive - maybe it is a league for playing defensive, negative  football and having quality up front to counter-attack.&quot; Reacting to his departure, Mowbray said: &quot;Naturally, I am very  disappointed to be leaving Glasgow Celtic. &quot;I am very proud to have not only managed but also played for a  club with such great tradition and that has tremendous roots in football  history. &quot;I would like to offer my sincere thanks to all of the players  and also to my staff who supported me so well. Finally, I would like to  wish the club every success in the future.&quot; League Managers&#39; Association chief executive Richard Bevan said:  &quot;It is disappointing that Celtic have parted company with Tony despite  being in charge for less than a year, especially when taking into  account that the club still have a great chance of silverware this  season having reached the semi-finals of the Active Nation Scottish Cup. &quot;I am positive that a manager of Tony&#39;s calibre, with his success  at WBA and Hibernian, and with an overall managerial win ratio of a  soaring 45% in 297 matches in charge, will be back in management in the  not too distant future.&quot;   <br><br><b>TONY MOWBRAY FACTFILE</b>  <br>1963: Born November 22, Saltburn, North Yorkshire. <br>1981: Signs for Middlesbrough as an apprentice. <br>1982: Makes debut in September in 1-1 draw at Newcastle at the  age of 18.

There is also the cost of acquiring Mowbray and his  management team of Mark Venus and Peter Grant and the expense of paying them off  after only nine months. Mowbray was not, of course, Celtic&#39;s first choice last  summer.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Owen Coyle turned them down and the possibility of pairing  Henrik Larsson with Mark McGhee was stillborn. Former Hoops idol Larsson will  undoubtedly be in Desmond&#39;s thoughts again. Larsson has now entered management  with Swedish club Landskrona but if he is to return to the east end of Glasgow  it would have to be in tandem with an experienced figure.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>The trouble for Celtic is that an established name with  pedigree - and the essential ability to construct an obdurate but attractive  team - will not come cheap.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Like Larsson, Norwich City&#39;s Paul Lambert has a prior  connection with Celtic, and has been working his way through the managerial  ranks.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Lambert&#39;s spell with Borussia Dortmund, with whom he won a  Champions League medal, adds gravitas to his CV, but he is short of the wow  factor.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Given that Celtic need someone who could handle the  singular pressures of life at an Old Firm club and who is also something of a  showman, Giovanni Trapattoni should not be ruled out, especially given Desmond&#39;s  eye for marketing opportunities in Ireland.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>One pressure that has been removed from Celtic is the need  for urgent action. The Scottish title race is lost but they are favourites for  the Active Nation Scottish Cup, by dint of Rangers losing to Dundee United on  Wednesday.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Neil Lennon is now in charge for an indefinite period, but  an upsurge in form and commitment under the former Parkhead captain would almost  certainly keep him in place until the end of the season. In those circumstances,  too, the combination of Lennon with a proven coach of the stature of Trapattoni  would present a potent mixture.</div> <div class="TailParas">In the meantime, while many Celtic fans are sorry for  Mowbray on a personal basis, they are relieved to be done with the manager&#39;s  habitual vapourings, of which his response to the defeat by St Mirren was  typical.</div> <div class="TailParas">In a barely disguised dig at Rangers, Mowbray said of the  SPL: &quot;Maybe it is a league for playing defensive football and negative football  and yet have the quality up front to counterattack, particularly away from  home.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Given that Rangers have scored more, conceded fewer and  have a goal difference better than twice as good as Celtic&#39;s, that utterance  indicated that Mowbray was not only about to part from his employers, but had  already detached himself from reality.</div> <div class="TailParas">&copy; 2010 Telegraph Group Limited, London </div> <div class="TailParas">The Daily Telegraph</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="LeadPara"><div class="Title"><h3>Celtic on lookout as Mowbray reign ends</h3></div> <div class="Provided"> <div>26 March 2010</div>Provided by: <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=%22GPW:IRISEX%5Cs%22" target="_self">The Irish  Examiner</a></div><br>TONY MOWBRAY&rsquo;S troubled nine-month reign as Celtic boss was  at an end yesterday after the club announced his departure.</div> <div class="LeadPara"><br>Ex-skipper Paul Lambert has been installed as the  bookmakers&rsquo; favourite but stated recently he has no desire to return to the east  end of Glasgow.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Mowbray&rsquo;s exit followed Wednesday&rsquo;s 4-0 SPL thrashing at St  Mirren, which left the Hoops 10 points behind arch-rivals Rangers having played  two games more.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>It is believed 46-year-old Mowbray met chief executive  Peter Lawwell at Celtic&rsquo;s Lennoxtown training ground yesterday morning when the  decision was taken to end his short tenure.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Assistant manager Mark Venus and Peter Grant have also lost  their jobs, with Neil Lennon appointed interim manager.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Chairman John Reid said: &quot;On behalf of the board and  everyone at Celtic Football Club, I would like to offer Tony Mowbray my thanks  and sincere best wishes for the future.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;Tony is held in great affection by Celtic fans and it is  obviously with great disappointment that we make today&rsquo;s statement.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;During his period here, Tony has always acted with great  dignity as he has done today.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;We are all Celtic supporters, faithful through and  through, Tony included.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;We are all disappointed at the way things have gone this  season.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;However, as supporters, we will collectively build again  to reestablish the club to its pre-eminent position within Scottish  football.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Wednesday night&rsquo;s defeat was the 13th of Mowbray&rsquo;s reign  after he succeeded Gordon Strachan in the summer.

No Old Firm manager can survive his club&#39;s heaviest league defeat outside of derbies for three decades. Not when this comes against relegation-threatened, typically winless and goalless, opponents. Not when the result leaves them potentially 16 points behind their bitterest rivals. Not when the players Mowbray sent out appeared to chuck it, and seemed latterly to be chucked on willy-nilly as he fielded six attackers in a 3-1-6 formation. Not when he as good as conceded afterwards his philosophy of football, &quot;trying to force the game and be expansive&quot;, wasn&#39;t the way to go in the Scottish league.<br><br>And not when the personnel Mowbray initially selected, and the 4-2-3-1 system he set it out in, had an element of experimentation at a juncture in the season when he simply had to see out wins to allow him to make it to the summer. He would see that experimentation as a courageous adherence to the bigger picture; others would describe it as making life unnecessarily difficult for himself. Indeed, therein lies one of the central issues. In taking responsibility for leaving his young central defence of 19-year-old Josh Thompson and 23-year-old Darren O&#39;Dea exposed by his Light Brigade-style charge, Mowbray defended the &quot;positive&quot; attempts to retrieve a lost cause by saying you could be &quot;a brave coach, or a negative coach&quot;. <br><br>For him, there are no inbetweens, even if you can also be a sensible coach, playing the percentage game, when the predicament demands. He would see this as an affront to his footballing sensibilities that amounted to a fixation with playing an attractive, attacking passing game. He was stubborn about how he felt he could deliver success and how he felt he should be able to conduct himself in the media; in each instance appealing to a higher set of principles &ndash; as a thoroughly good man does in all aspects of his life.<br><br>But in this grubby world of Scottish football, you need to get your hands dirty, need to indulge others in their games and not simply set your face against them. In press rooms as much as football fields up and down the country, Mowbray said what he thought and fielded teams he thought a collection of good players ... instead of giving primary consideration to how his thinking would play out. As a result, he was spun &ndash; one of his favourite words &ndash; and baited remorselessly in newsprint and had to watch as results regularly threatened to spin out of control.<br><br>That said, what most destroyed his hopes of achieving his footballing nirvana wasn&#39;t any flaw in his psyche, his professional approach, his demeanour, or whatever else will be claimed in the coming days. It was something altogether less tangible, and entirely uncontrollable: it was fate. No more and no less. There will be some who will home in on his transfer dealings, or outgoings, in pinpointing where it all went wrong. But his complete overhaul of the team was remedial work long overdue. Mowbray inherited a league- losing team from Gordon Strachan, his side winning only nine of the last 22 matches across 90 minutes &ndash; a run that included, incidentally, a cup defeat at St Mirren Park &ndash; and had the domestic third-string Co-operative Insurance Cup as their only booty. As a result, with the semi-finals of the Scottish Cup to come for a now Neil Lennon-led Celtic, there is still the possibility this season might prove more productive than the previous campaign to Mowbray&#39;s arrival in the only gauge that counts: silverware.<br><br>Of course, in terms of league points, it seems certain to be a whole heap worse, which fatally undermined the case for Mowbray continuing in his post. But it should be recognised the 46-year-old&#39;s downfall was his inability to arrest a decline long before set in motion, not be the architect of such. In some ways what damns him is that, in recruiting such as Robbie Keane, Morten Rasmussen, Landry Nguemo, Ki Seung Yung, Jos Hooiveld, Thomas Rogne and allowing Scott McDonald, Chris Killen, Paul Hartley, Barry Robson, Gary Caldwell and Stephen McManus to go elsewhere he appeared to attract better quality than he inherited. It damns him because he hasn&#39;t be able to gel his group into an effective unit. <br><br>That is where luck, or Mowbray&#39;s lack of it, comes in; the feeling it was simply pre-ordained it wouldn&#39;t happen for him as the club&#39;s 16th manager. He was never able to field what he would consider his strongest XI and, for the past two months of the season his three preferred central defenders &ndash; Hooiveld, Rogne, and Glenn Loovens &ndash; have hardly featured because of injury. The equivalent for Rangers would have been doing without David Weir, Madjid Bougherra and Danny Wilson at the same time for a quarter of the campaign. <br><br>Mowbray&#39;s teams have produced marginally better football than the sterile fare served up by the Celtic sides of last season, dominated opponents more often, and yet contrived to lose more league games, dribbling away points with alarming regularity. That has not always been their own doing, it should be noted. Celtic have suffered poor refereeing calls, most pointedly in the three derby games. Ultimately, though, even that simply strengthened the belief that Mowbray&#39;s management of Celtic was utterly bedeviled.<br><br>Supporters do not tolerate hard-luck stories. And after nine months, 13 defeats, nine draws and a modest 23 wins, Mowbray had no future with Celtic because the club&#39;s followers couldn&#39;t countenance one. They had given up on his vision they initially, cautiously, welcomed, and turned on him venomously at St Mirren Park. It was an unfortunate farewell for a man the Celtic faithful had always held in warm regard over the &quot;honesty, integrity, humility and respect&quot; he had shown in dealing with personal tragedy and immersing himself in all things Celtic when a player at the club in the early 1990s.<br><br>But humanity and decency don&#39;t sell season tickets. And the evaporation of the last vestiges of support he had made him a commercial liability.<br><br>Football boards don&#39;t continue to buy into long-term projects when they are headed by men who are box-office flops. By remaining in charge, Mowbray&#39;s very presence would have permeated a feel-bad factor just as season ticket renewal forms begin to flap through letterboxes. That wouldn&#39;t do for the Parkhead powerbrokers but, in doing the right thing by themselves, the best interests of Mowbray were also served. <br><br>It had become unpleasant to see the thrawn and agitated figure he had become. It wasn&#39;t him. Living apart from his England-based wife and three children &ndash; the youngest, at under a year, he has hardly spent any time with &ndash; was the sacrifice he was willing to make to guide a club whose &quot;tremendous ... football history&quot; he last night evoked in a statement. Despite the best intentions, Mowbray must carry the regret he could not add to that history. </div><br>                                                                                            <div class="ds-paging">                                                   <div class="centre">Page 1 of 1</div>                                                 </div>                       <br>                                                                        <ul class="viewarticle_info"><li>                           Last Updated:                             25 March 2010 10:46 PM                         </li><li>                                                        Source:                              The Scotsman                                                    </li><li>                           Location:                            Edinburgh                         <br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Mowbray turned the gun on himself; Roddy Forsyth</h3> <div class="Provided"> <div>26 March 2010</div>Provided by: <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=%22GPW:DT%5Cs%22" target="_self">The Daily Telegraph</a></div><div class="LeadPara">RODDY FORSYTH AS A man born on the day of John F Kennedy&#39;s  assassination, it was perhaps no wonder that Tony Mowbray had an obsessive fear  of snipers. At every Celtic press briefing he approached questions as though  they were street corners during the battle for Stalingrad, craning his  imagination to try to discern what ambush might lurk on the blindside.</div> <div class="LeadPara">There is a culture within Celtic which nourishes itself on  the belief that the media is a force permanently arrayed against it, but no  manager in recent memory bought into the mythology as willingly or completely as  the 46 year-old from Saltburn. He did not, of course, read a newspaper - another  of his mantras - but he was always well informed about any criticism that  appeared in print, via the peculiar Parkhead conduit that channels a corrosive  flow of bile into the manager&#39;s ear.</div> <div class="TailParas">The irony is that a reservoir of goodwill existed towards  Mowbray because of the tragedy that afflicted him during his playing days at  Celtic, when his first wife, Bernadette, died of cancer. The book he coauthored  about that passage of his life Kissed By An Angel although written by a  journalist, guaranteed him a widespread consideration that was present, even  until the end of his managerial career at the club arrived yesterday.</div> <div class="TailParas">Questions about what pressure he might feel as a manager,  or how he should respond to setbacks on the field, were couched in the implicit  understanding - and sometimes with the straightforward acknowledgement - that he  had been forced to accommodate a perspective that put mere football results in  their proper place. Yet even with this safety zone around him, he was profoundly  suspicious of what he liked to call &quot;the west of Scotland media, with their  black and white view of the game&quot;. Had his players been as comprehensively  defensive on the pitch as Mowbray was in press conferences, Celtic would now be  at or around the top of the Scottish Premier League table. This personal trait,  needless to say, would not have mattered - in fact, it would have been greeted  with approval by many of the club&#39;s supporters - had there been clear signs of  progress in his reconstruction of the team inherited by Gordon Strachan.</div> <div class="TailParas">In one respect, Mowbray deserves a ration of sympathy. A  manager supervising a period of transition needs a degree of luck in order to  impose his new order quickly. Mowbray made his moves in January, dismantling the  old defensive guard of Gary Caldwell and Stephen McManus, but their replacements  - Thomas Rogne and Jos Hooiveld - have hardly been seen because of injury, while  Glenn Loovens has also appeared only intermittently over the last couple of  months.</div> <div class="TailParas">Mowbray refused to make a particular issue of the  disruption, on the grounds that all managers have to endure injuries and  suspensions and that, with greater resources at his disposal than any club in  Scotland apart from Rangers, he would be seen as ungracious to complain.  Likewise, he distanced himself from the attack on refereeing standards in this  season&#39;s Old Firm games fed to the BBC by an anonymous club source last  month.</div> <div class="TailParas">Such attitudes bespoke a respect for fair play on Mowbray&#39;s  part and, while there was also a reserve to the man which some construed as  arrogance, those closest to him insist that shyness was the dominant factor.  However, the bear pit of the Old Firm rivalry affords managers no such  allowances.</div> <div class="TailParas">Mowbray was never able to make a cogent case for his work  in progress - and, in fact, had utterly no interest in doing so. Every nuance  was pur&eacute;ed into a bland set of utterances, week after week, to the effect that  the team was no better and no worse than it had been at the start of the season  - yet he also insisted that critics could not see the beauty of Celtic&#39;s  performances because of their fixation with results.</div> <div class="TailParas">Conspiracy theories filled the void felt by Americans after  the death of JFK. Mowbray nourished a raft of his own about the media, but it  was not they who supervised the debacle in Paisley on Wednesday night. In the  end, as they say in other circumstances, he turned the gun on himself.</div> <div class="TailParas">&copy; 2010 Telegraph Group Limited, London </div> <div class="TailParas">The Daily Telegraph</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>&#39;The Celtic players never had good vibes from Mowbray&#39;; Former  players and colleagues give their thoughts on the sacking yesterday of the  manager after a disappointing first season</h3> <div class="Provided"> <div>26 March 2010</div>Provided by: <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=%22GPW:T%5Cs%22" target="_self">The Times</a></div><div class="LeadPara">Tommy Gemmell, the Lisbon Lion, believes the Celtic players  received &quot;bad vibes&quot; from Tony Mowbray.</div> <div class="LeadPara">Gemmell, who managed the Dundee team that beat Celtic 5-1 in  1980, says Mowbray&#39;s lack of action from the dugout could have sealed his  fate.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;There seemed to be little verve or enthusiasm from the  manager on the touchline. Certainly, he wasn&#39;t the most animated boss I&#39;ve ever  seen. You couldn&#39;t compare him with Martin O&#39;Neill, for a start.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Sometimes you need good vibes from your manager. You need  to see his involvement from the dugout. The Celtic players rarely got that from  Mowbray. His head went down after St Mirren&#39;s second goal the other night. Yet  there was still a third of the game still to play. Something could have been  salvaged and the players would have looked at their manager for some  inspiration.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;We got it from Jock Stein, that&#39;s for sure. I recall a  game where we were well in front and Bertie Auld, Bobby Murdoch and myself were  knocking the ball about and seeing out the 90 minutes.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Big Jock was in the dugout on the opposite side of the  pitch. But, even with his bad limp, he got up, walked round behind the goal and  came down the touchline on the Jungle side of the ground to berate the three of  us.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;The points were in the bag, but he still wanted more and  he told us in no uncertain terms. I couldn&#39;t see Mowbray doing that.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Ironically, the last time Celtic lost by a four-goal margin  before the flop at St Mirren &mdash; outwith Rangers games &mdash; was back in 1980 against  Dundee, managed by Gemmell.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I recall that game well,&quot; he said. &quot;We won 5-1 after  Celtic had opened the scoring through Roy Aitken.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It&#39;s amazing to think it has taken another Scottish club  30 years to emulate that feat. Celtic shouldn&#39;t lose four goals in a game and,  of course, that happened earlier in the season in the 4-4 draw with Aberdeen.  That is most unlike my old club. &quot;Mowbray was a centre-half in his playing days  and you would expect him to have some sort of expertise in that role and what is  expected of his central defenders. That hasn&#39;t been the case.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;There hasn&#39;t been a settled doubleact in the middle of the  rearguard and he has chopped and changed the backfour throughout the campaign.  &quot;I believe there has been something like 15 players utilised in the back four  since the start of the season. That&#39;s unsettling, for sure.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Celtic have now been beaten in 13 games under Mowbray and,  in fact, have lost seven SPL matches, one more than Motherwell and Dundee  United. That&#39;s unacceptable.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Gemmell also believes Mowbray got off to a bad start when  he realised he wasn&#39;t first choice as Gordon Strachan&#39;s successor. He added:  &quot;Celtic apparently went for Roberto Mart&iacute;nez before he left Swansea for Wigan.  And they were also linked with Owen Coyle before he quit Burnley for  Bolton.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;So, Mowbray would have realised he was third-choice for  the post. That should never have been the case.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Everything should have been done and dusted before he was  unveiled as manager &mdash; Mart&iacute;nez and Coyle should never have been  mentioned.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Peter Rafferty, president of the Affiliation of Celtic  Supporters&#39; Clubs, believes Tony Mowbray&#39;s fate was sealed when he finally lost  the backing of the fans after Wednesday night&#39;s 4-0 defeat at St Mirren.</div> <div class="TailParas">Rafferty believes there was only one possible outcome. &quot;I  don&#39;t suppose it has come as any great surprise unfortunately because of the way  the results have been going,&quot; he said.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It&#39;s been a very topsy-turvy season for us so far. The [St  Mirren] result was just one result too many for the fans. The manner in which we  were defeated didn&#39;t go down well at all.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Mowbray&#39;s predecessor, Gordon Strachan, believes the  scrutiny Old Firm managers are under is greater than ever. Recalling Walter  Smith&#39;s return to Rangers three years ago, he said: &quot;After about six months, he  said the big difference was night and day. He said, &#39;The whole thing, the media  thing is absolutely brutal.&#39; Now we&#39;ve got internet chat rooms; everything can  start rumours that you have to deal with, which we never had before and he said  it&#39;s changed completely.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">The European Cup-winning captain and former manager, Billy  McNeill, said: &quot;If you&#39;re getting some decent results then the Celtic fans will  be there in their hordes. But if you don&#39;t, you pay the penalty.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Referring to the St Mirren defeat, the former Celtic  striker, Frank Mc-Avennie, said: &quot;I&#39;ve never seen it so bad. I was one of those  who wanted Tony Mowbray but it really hasn&#39;t worked out. He brought in players  who just were not good enough for Celtic and I didn&#39;t buy all that talk of  building for the future.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;He didn&#39;t move his family up to Glasgow. I think he  realised after a short period that he was in it for the short haul and that the  job was too big for him.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Paul Hartley, who left Celtic for Bristol City as Mowbray  arrived in the summer after 2&frac12; years at the club, said: &quot;The St Mirren game was  the final straw. It&#39;s hard to find any positives. He got rid of too many players  too quickly. The backbone of the side had been a lot of the Scottish lads but  now there is no leadership on the park. The team looked desperate against St  Mirren. Rangers haven&#39;t bought a player in 18 months and yet they could be 16  points clear if they win the games in hand.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Richard Bevan, the League Managers Association chief  executive, said: &quot;It is disappointing that Celtic have parted company with Tony  despite being in charge for less than a year, especially when taking into  account that the club still have a great chance of silverware having reached the  semi-finals of the Active Nation Scottish Cup.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I am positive that a manager of Tony&#39;s calibre, with his  success at West Brom and Hibernian, and with an overall managerial win ratio of  a soaring 45 per cent in 297 matches in charge, will be back in management in  the not too distant future.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">The former Celtic winger, Davie Provan, said he fears the  club could struggle to find a top-class manager to replace Mowbray who would  meet the high expectations of the supporters. &quot;It&#39;s no surprise that Celtic have  taken the action they have,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it&#39;s just a matter of where they go  from here. I think it&#39;s fair to say it&#39;s a job, at the moment, that does not  hold the type of appeal that it had when Martin O&#39;Neill came to Glasgow.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;As recently as the summer, you need to remember that both  Owen Coyle and Roberto Mart&iacute;nez were approached to come to Celtic and neither  wanted to take up the challenge.</div> <div class="TailParas">It&#39;s going to be pretty difficult for Celtic to identify a  top-class manager to fill Tony Mowbray&#39;s position.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I think it&#39;s going to be a difficult appointment for  Celtic in terms of getting the right type of manager, given the expectations of  the Celtic support.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Asked what Lennon&#39;s immediate task is, Provan added: &quot;Just  to bring a bit of feelgood factor back to the club. I don&#39;t think Neil would be  a serious candidate for the job in the long term.&quot; Bertie Auld, the Lisbon Lion,  believes Mowbray&#39;s unwavering determination to stick to his footballing  principles ultimately proved to be his downfall at Celtic. But Auld insists  Mowbray&#39;s own footballing philosophy did not fit with the huge demand for  results at Celtic, just as it failed to keep West Brom in the English Premier  League.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It looked as though it was on the cards, with the  performances in the last few weeks and the inconsistency,&quot; Auld said. &quot;Everybody  knew he was under pressure. I thought he would have done a great job there but  he wouldn&#39;t change his ways. Everybody loves philosophy but the players dictate  the philosophy and the most important thing in his job was the results. &quot;I  thought he did a marvellous job at Hibs and West Brom but his philosophy also  knocked him down at West Brom as well when they got relegated last year.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Auld disagreed with the views of Provan, insisting the  Celtic job was still an attractive one. &quot;We have lost an awful lot of things  that my boss [Jock Stein] achieved at the club and brought to the club.<br>But the  most important thing that we haven&#39;t lost is the passion of the supporters,&quot; he  said. &quot;We still have that tremendous crowd of people and they will never, ever  change.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">And Auld believes Mowbray appeared to have lost that  enthusiasm in recent weeks. &quot;Was it the right time for him to go? Does anyone  really know that? I just felt the boy, himself, wasn&#39;t enjoying it, he didn&#39;t  look like he was getting any enjoyment from it,&quot; he said.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;To me, football is the type of game where you must get up  in the morning and look at yourself in the mirror and know that there&#39;s going to  be a challenge.</div> <div class="TailParas">And he didn&#39;t look as though he was enjoying it.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Craig Brown, the Motherwell manager, felt the departure of  Mowbray after just nine months was harsh. But the veteran boss concedes that the  gulf between Rangers and Celtic meant his exit was inevitable.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It&#39;s very disappointing to see any colleague lose his job,  particularly a really good guy, a gentleman,&quot; he said. &quot;I think it was a bit  harsh but it was becoming inevitable because of the distance between the old  rivals, Rangers and Celtic. I think maybe they have to try to redress the  balance and do something, and unfortunately usually the manager is the  casualty.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Speaking shortly before Mowbray&#39;s departure was confirmed,  Frank Mc-Garvey, who starred for both St Mirren and Celtic, said: &quot;The bottom  line is that if the manager doesn&#39;t win games then he doesn&#39;t stay in a  job.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I had given him the benefit of doubt but that went in  January against Kilmarnock when Scott Brown came on for Lee Naylor at left-back  when Celtic needed a goal. Then we saw Aiden McGeady ending up playing left-back  against St Mirren.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I think he lost the dressing room and, when you do that,  it&#39;s only a matter of time.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">One of the worst seasons</div> <div class="TailParas">Celtic are in the middle of their worst season for 19  years. The 4-0 defeat by St Mirren was their seventh league defeat of the season  and 13th of the campaign in all competitions, with two months of the season  left. Under Mowbray, Celtic played 45 times, won 23, drawn 9 and lost 13.</div> <div class="TailParas">The last time Celtic lost 13 times or more in one season  was in 1990-91. In Billy McNeill&#39;s last season in charge, they lost 12 times in  the Premier League and finished third behind Rangers and Aberdeen after picking  up just 41 points from 36 games.</div> <div class="TailParas">They also lost the League Cup final to Rangers and crashed  out of the Scottish Cup in the semi-finals to Motherwell. Celtic didn&#39;t even  qualify for Europe because they finished fifth in the previous season.</div> <div class="TailParas">(c) 2010 Times Newspapers Limited.

That was the day the  summer transfer window closed. It was also the day the Celtic manager declared  himself dissatisfied with his squad. Mowbray&rsquo;s stance was apparent as the scent  of revolution hung in the air.</div> <div class="LeadPara">If the Celtic players didn&rsquo;t know he was preparing to wield  the axe, his outpourings over the next few months would enlighten them. Mowbray  denies publicly stating that he wanted 10 new signings, but as results  fluctuated, he talked constantly of &ldquo;adding quality&rdquo;. It was obvious the  revolution would be bloody.</div> <div class="TailParas">Christmas came and went. In December, Celtic played four  league games and won three. The only defeat came against Hearts at Tynecastle  but Celtic had played with 10 men for 59 minutes and should have won. Mowbray  now had a settled side and his philosophy was slowly connecting.</div> <div class="TailParas">Rangers were up next in the first game of 2010 but Celtic&rsquo;s  dominance only yielded a 1-1 draw. Regardless, it was deemed as progress and  Mowbray had a choice to make on personnel. Stick or twist. His decision  ultimately cost him his job.</div> <div class="TailParas">Gary Caldwell will be remembered for myriad reasons at  Celtic Park. He won every domestic honour during his three-and-a-half years and  was Mowbray&rsquo;s captain for the majority of his reign. He was also a member of the  now infamous &ldquo;January Seven&rdquo;.</div> <div class="TailParas">With the SPL title in the balance, Mowbray sanctioned  wholesale changes. The departures of fringe men Willo Flood and Chris Killen  didn&rsquo;t register, but Caldwell, Barry Robson, Scott McDonald, Danny Fox and  Stephen McManus were all regarded as regulars. They were replaced but the heart  had been ripped out of a team.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;The transfer window was the turning point for Tony,&rdquo;  Caldwell told the Sunday Herald. &ldquo;To let go of so many first-team players in  such a short space of time was always going to be a risk. We&rsquo;re not talking  about squad players. Of the seven who left Celtic, four or five would have  always been in the side.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;Myself, Danny Fox, Barry Robson and Scott McDonald all  featured in that draw with Rangers. Big Mick [McManus] was on the bench. We  dominated Rangers. It was as one-sided a derby as I&rsquo;ve ever seen, but within  weeks we had all left the club.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;To lose almost half a team in one transfer window is  always going to give you a problem. Tony probably thought he was getting quality  players in but how often does a new team click straight away?</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;In time, all of these new players might gel, but there was  a title to win. When Tony made the changes, Rangers were ahead and you don&rsquo;t get  time to gel a team together at Celtic. Old Firm football doesn&rsquo;t work that  way.&rdquo;</div> <div class="TailParas">Caldwell feels an awkwardness in performing an autopsy on  Mowbray&rsquo;s doomed reign. He played under him at Hibernian and Celtic, and holds  him in the highest regard, despite the events of this season. &ldquo;Tony will manage  in the Premier League again, I&rsquo;m certain of that,&rdquo; he said.</div> <div class="TailParas">Now at Wigan Athletic, Caldwell is satisfied with life, but  deep down still harbours regrets over his departure from Celtic and the manner  in which he was ushered out of the door as soon as Wigan made an acceptable  bid.</div> <div class="TailParas">Upon leaving Celtic, Caldwell openly questioned whether  Mowbray wanted to sell him as his strained contract talks with the club&rsquo;s  hierarchy reached a stalemate. Misguided reports labelled him a money-grabber,  but Caldwell, Scotland&rsquo;s current Player of the Year and the regular captain,  only requested parity with those of a similar status within the Celtic  squad.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;Whether all that coming and going in January was  completely Tony&rsquo;s decision, only he will know the answer,&rdquo; Caldwell said. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know what goes on behind the scenes. But he&rsquo;s the manager and the  responsibility [for the transfers] lies with him.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;To make so many changes was a huge gamble but as a manager  he is accountable for those decisions. Was it 100% his decision to let all of us  go? I don&rsquo;t know. Tony is the only man who really knows that. Ultimately, he has  to live or die by his decisions and I think it cost him in the end. He wanted to  take the club to a new level, but it didn&rsquo;t work out for him.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed for Tony more than anything else. I like  him as a man. I played under him this season so a part of me feels that I let  him down. Ultimately, players have to take responsibility for results as much as  the manager.&rdquo;</div> <div class="TailParas">Mowbray has been accused of many failings, but Caldwell  feels his main problem was a reluctance to adapt his &ldquo;expansive&rdquo; style to the  unforgiving environs of the SPL.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;He was looking for a balance and never got it right,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;He wanted to play a certain way, but at Celtic you are always judged on  results. Nothing else matters. The pressure and demands are unique.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;Tony ultimately found it difficult to adapt to that level  of expectation. He had a set philosophy and wanted to stick to it at all times.  That philosophy never got him results and it cost him his job.&rdquo;</div> <div class="TailParas">Caldwell contacted interim manager Neil Lennon on Friday  morning and expects his former team-mate to tell some home truths to Celtic&rsquo;s  highly-paid, underachieving players. Long-term, Caldwell sees no reason why  Lennon can&rsquo;t get the job permanently.</div> <div class="TailParas">&ldquo;Lenny won&rsquo;t mess about,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He will go into that  dressing-room and rattle a few cages. That was his style as a player and he&rsquo;ll  be the same as a manager. As a coach, he is brilliant at motivating.

I am a miserable sod. At least, that&#39;s the way I am perceived.&#39;<br>Enlarge Tony Mowbray<br><br>I don&iquest;t do fancy: Tony Mowbray likes his teams to play with a certain style<br><br>There are at least two serious sides to Tony Mowbray, born perhaps out of working-class hardship in the North East and the tragedy that scarred his life.<br><br>Mowbray greatly values his precious time with his loving wife Amber and young children Lucas and Max, yet he freely acknowledges the effect on him of the death from breast cancer of his first wife 13 years ago. Bernadette, from Glasgow, was only 26 when she died in his arms on New Year&#39;s Day.<br><br>The couple had been married only eight months, a painful period documented movingly in his celebrated cathartic book, Kissed By An Angel.<br><br>The wedding ceremony took place on April 3, 1994 and, even in the midst of preparations for Saturday&#39;s FA Cup semi-final against Portsmouth, Mowbray took time out privately to mark the anniversary yesterday. Of all days, Bernadette would have been 39 on Saturday.<br><br>&#39;Please, please, don&#39;t make this out as if I want to win the Cup for Bernadette. That would not be the case and it would be so disrespectful to Amber and the kids,&#39; he says.<br><br>&#39;Going through an experience like that undoubtedly impacted on my thinking and my way of life. It has given me a certain perspective. I don&#39;t get too uptight with my team. I don&#39;t throw teacups, for example.&#39;<br><br>It was different in his playing days. &#39;I could never socialise after defeats. I would lock myself away. The hurt of losing as a player was much greater before I lost my wife, which happened late in my career.<br><br>&#39;As a manager now, defeat can still spoil my weekend. But I have learned to try to look at the bigger picture. Are we moving in the right direction? Is the team playing the way we want them to? Are we entertaining? Over the longer term will we win more games? I don&#39;t get too stuck on a bad result.&#39;<br><br>Mowbray feels the answer to the above questions, in relation to West Bromwich Albion, will still be &#39;yes&#39; even if they lose to Portsmouth and fail to go up to the Barclays Premier League. Baggies fans might find such a disappointing combination a little harder to swallow.<br><br>While recoiling at suggestions of being an idealist, Mowbray has his sights on loftier goals than the top division or the top of an open-topped bus.<br><br>&#39;I want other people to look and think &iquest;aesthetically, I like watching West Brom&iquest;,&#39; he says.<br><br>&#39;As a coach at Ipswich I would go and watch every Arsenal Champions League game. I would get on the train, go to London and marvel at what they do. All they are doing is passing the ball 10 yards to each other but it is poetry.<br><br>&#39;Watching this machine move the ball around, so fluent and effortless, Freddie Ljungberg coming in off the left, Robert Pires drifting past people. Just beautiful to watch. They do not do anything but pass to team-mates in better positions. Simplicity is genius. This is what I want my players to do.&#39;<br><br>A lack of a smile does not mean a lack of passion. Mowbray has been &#39;Mogga&#39; to his friends since childhood but Bruce Rioch, the manager who made him Middlesbrough&#39;s captain at 22 and introduced him to patterns of play, once called him Zeus.<br><br>Rioch thought his spiky-haired, blond-highlighted, bronzed skipper returning from a summer holiday looked like a Greek god.<br><br>He was obviously a fan. He famously identified Mowbray as the man he would want at his side on a lunar rocket, a compliment which led to Boro fans entitling their fanzine Fly Me to the Moon.<br><br>Middlesbrough supporters, for whom Mowbray achieved heroic status, used to joke that when Manchester United bought Gary Pallister in 1989 for a record British transfer fee of &pound;2.3m, they got the wrong central defender.<br><br>&#39;I remember that. Was it a joke? I am still good friends with Pally. I speak to him quite regularly,&#39; says Mowbray.<br><br>&#39;He was a fantastic footballer. I could not match his pace and strength. He was a man-mountain, Bambi on ice initially and then a monster of a guy. As he was learning the game, I was his Steve Bruce of the Man U period &iquest; a voice, an organiser, a motivator, getting the best out of his talents.&#39;<br><br>Mowbray, the player, acquired a reputation as an uncompromising stopper who would take bullets for the cause. Yet, he had been a goal-scoring midfield player in his youth.<br><br>&#39;Your talent can get suppressed, I think. Because I was 6ft 2in I was put to the back. You are told to get your head on it and clear your lines. You are a defender.<br><br>&#39;Up until 15 and 16 I had been scoring plenty of goals. I was a linchpin in midfield, getting the ball and spraying it about, beating people, making things happen. The bigger picture prevailed. I took on the responsibility for the team,&#39; he recalls.<br><br>&#39;Who knows if that centre half ever given the licence could have operated in centre midfield, painting pictures, seeing things round the corner, flicking the ball with his boot, joining in a one-two?<br><br>&#39;In my mind I knew all the moves. I got patterned into destroying and heading the first ball, getting first contact in the box, heading goalkicks back into the opposition half.&#39;<br><br>If Mowbray sounds like a frustrated playmaker, that&#39;s because he is. &#39;It is part of the reason I want my players to express themselves really. My centre halves at some time in their lives have probably been the best players on the pitch, at school or for their district. It is trying to bring that out, encouraging them to play and pass,&#39; he adds.<br><br>There is a second irony here, though. West Bromwich Albion&#39;s current weakness is in the area where he personally was strongest. Like Arsenal, the Baggies have been labelled something of a soft touch, fragile away from home, conceding goals from set-pieces, perhaps defensively not the most resolute.<br><br>Mowbray nods. &#39;I am probably harsh on my central defenders because we do lose goals that teams do not have to work hard for. We are not good enough at getting first contact on balls coming into our box.&#39;<br><br>Mowbray, the manager, at 44 young and aspirational, has in his short career established a reputation for sending out teams which entertain. The destroyer has become the creator.<br><br>Hibs were indisputably the most attractive side in Scotland during his two years there, winning three times at Ibrox and also at Celtic yet &iquest; and this may be significant with tomorrow in mind &iquest; losing two Cup semi-finals.<br><br>It is not only who he is. It is also where he has been. He spent nine years as player and coach at Ipswich, a club steeped in attacking, passing football.<br><br>There were also four years at Celtic, where all-out attack has always been the imperative &iquest; even during the so-called &#39;barren years&#39; with which his time there coincided.<br><br>The Huddle, now universal in many sports, was his great legacy. &#39;I don&#39;t like to put a patent on it. But I take a great sense of pride in it. It was nothing to do with my wife, as has been wrongly reported. It came out of adversity. The Celtic players needed to show real unity and togetherness. We needed to show the supporters we cared.&#39;<br><br>Which was precisely why the manager initiated its first Albion manifestation after the draw at Charlton last month.<br><br>That kind of attitude could take West Bromwich Albion to a Wembley final, 18 years after Mowbray last led a team out there.<br><br>Colin Todd, who had just taken over from Rioch at Middlesbrough, insisted that Mowbray, sidelined during the week through injury, should don a blazer and lead out the team alongside Chelsea manager Bobby Campbell in the Zenith Data Systems Cup Final.<br><br>He was smiling then.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><img align="bottom" alt="Mowbray, Tony - Articles (Misc) - The Celtic Wiki" height="550" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/0c07472f3fc755e2398463f59f08daa8/GW912H550" title="Mowbray, Tony - Articles (Misc) - The Celtic Wiki" width="912"><br></div>
