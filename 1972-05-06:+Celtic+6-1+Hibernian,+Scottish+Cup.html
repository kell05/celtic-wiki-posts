It was an entertaining game but the contest was over after Celtic&#39;s third goal when Hibs disintegrated. Celtic went for the throat in the second half and could have had more than six.   <br><br>Before the game there was disappointment when both David Hay and Harry Hood were declared unfit because of injury.<br><br>Dixie Deans was star man with a brilliant hat trick and did a famous &#39;roly poly&#39; cart wheel on the Hampden turf after his third goal. This was his first cup final he was appearing in and was only days after the tragedy of his penalty miss against Inter Milan in the European cup semi final.<br><br>Every Celtic player was on form but there were truly outstanding performances from Bobby Murdoch and Jimmy Johnstone. McNeill scored in his third Scottish cup final - a magnificent record for a centre half.<br><br>This was Jim Craig&#39;s last game and he went out on a high with his Celtic team mates giving him a send off to remember.<br><br>The attendance of 106,000 eclipsed the glamourous Wembley final between Leeds and Arsenal by 6,000.<br><br>The winning Celtic team was minus the talents of McGrain, Hay, Hood, Lennox, Davidson and Quinn which gives an example of the strength in depth Celtic had at that time. It was to be a pity that the Celts did not win the penalty shoot out as a European Cup final against a Johan Cruff inspired Ajax would have been quite a prospect and with Celtic in this kind of form they could easily have won it again as in 1967.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams;</h3><b>Celtic: </b>  <br>  <a href="/page/Williams%2C+Evan" target="_self">Williams</a>; <a href="/page/Craig%2C+Jim" target="_self">Craig</a>, <a href="/page/Brogan%2C+Jim" target="_self">Brogan</a>, <a href="/page/Murdoch%2C+Bobby" target="_self">Murdoch</a>, <a href="/page/McNeill%2C+Billy+%281958-75%29" target="_self">McNeill</a>, <a href="/page/Connelly%2C+George" target="_self">Connelly</a>,<a href="/page/Johnstone%2C+Jimmy+%27Jinky%27" target="_self"> Johnstone</a>, <a href="/page/Deans%2C+John+%22Dixie%22" target="_self">Deans</a>, <a href="/page/Macari%2C+Lou" target="_self">Macari</a>, <a href="/page/Dalglish%2C+Kenny" target="_self">Dalglish</a>, <a href="/page/Callaghan%2C+Tommy" target="_self">Callaghan</a>.

HIBERNIAN 1</b></div>  <div>   On Hampden&#39;s field Hibs&#39; hopes lay shredded and Celtic enthused over  winning the Scottish Cup as if that were something new to them. Jock  Stein grinned expansively and, with fitting decorum, acknowledged the  acclaim of the supporters. We wondered what was to be done about this  Celtic for it is becoming ridiculous that they should win seven  successive league championships then score six goals in the Scottish Cup  final and against what was, beforehand declared to be the most  formidable challengers that could be produced. <br><br>At Celtic Park  yesterday Jock Stein had little to say about the match except that it  spoke for itself. He told me: &quot;That&#39;s the past, &quot;come and see the  future.&quot; We went out to the field where two teams were playing.<br><br>They  were from Celtic&#39;s 14 to 16-year-olds and if I were to tell of the  astonishing speed and skill and team-sense and attacking flair these  lads showed then it would send waves of despair through Scottish club  football.<br><br>The evidence is that the Scottish League are premature  in designing a trophy to mark Celtic winning seven successive League  championships. They should wait until the run is over.<br><br>If there  could be any com&shy;plaint about a pleasing Cup final on Saturday it would  be that the score-line, suggests that it was an uninteresting one-sided  game. It was never that, not even in the final minutes, when Hibs were  on their knees, for even then that great competitor, Pat Stanton, was  charging into Celtic&#39;s defence seeking a goal to ease his hurt pride.<br><br><b>LINK WITH 6-1</b><br><br>Hibs  had gone to Hampden with such hope and confidence, with such backing  and encouragement, that to lose would have been bad enough. To lose by  the biggest score ever in the history of the 98-year-old competition was  shattering and maybe incomprehensible to them. The 6-1 final score had  been matched in 1888 when Renton, the world champions then, beat  Cambuslang. <br><br>There is a link in the scores in that after that  final Kelly and McCallum the Renton half backs left and joined a new  club being formed in Glasgow&mdash; Celtic! James Kelly became captain of the  first Celtic team. He was the father of the late Sir Robert.<br><br>The  simple explanation of Hibs&#39; defeat is that Bobby Murdoch established  himself as boss of the mid-field. He ruled that area with the haughty  majesty of a ring master, bringing order to it and sending out his acts  to delight the audience.<br><br><b>WORLD CLASS</b><br><br>His was  football of world class. Its quality was not just in interception and  positioning and in accurate imaginative passes to inspire attacks, but  in the less flamboyant settling passes. He could step into trouble and  sweep the ball back to the goalkeeper or to a distant part of the field  to allow the defence to get organised again. He always did the right  thing. In such form there would be a place for him in any team in the  world. Yet he is not in the Scotland pool of 22 players for the Home  Internationals. <br><br>He was well supported by the running of the  willing Tommy Callaghan but not so well by Kenny Dalglish who was out of  touch completely and found usefulness only in filling space where Hibs  hoped to find it. They had banked on establishing some sort of control  in the mid-field.</div>  <div>  <br>Hibs had looked for so much from  Alex Edwards but got very little. I had wondered about him before the  match but had not expected that he could so vanish from the play that  Pat Stanton would be shouldered with an intolerable burden. Jimmy  O&rsquo;Rourke had his troubles with the speedy Celts and Stanton was left  doing the work of three and in a position which is not his best.</div>  <div>  <br>Things  began to go wrong for Hibs when the rain came on Friday night and made  the turf right. The ball sat down and that suited Jimmy Johnstone. There  were ominous signs for them them even before the first goal was scored  after 120 seconds. Johnstone beat a few men and Celtic strung together a  few passes and clearly they were in the mood.<br><br>Johnstone gave  Hibs&#39; defence a terrible time. His briefing was to go wherever he could  find space. Thus, since he played in no specific position he was hard to  mark. Once he got jinking there was only one way to stop him and when  Hibs&rsquo; defenders resorted to that they lost two goals from free kicks.</div>  <div>  .</div>  <div>  </div>  <div>   The first was a bad one to lose for when Billy McNeill took up  position for the free kick he was loosely marked with much space in  front of him and into that the ball was put. He was unimpeded when he  shot the goal. There after Gordon had to do much running going up with  McNeill for the set pieces in front of goal.<br><br>It was one of  McNeill&#39;s best games. He had impressive control in the air and the  expected heading duel between him and Alan Gordon did not materialise.  Gordon won the ball but twice yet each header of his produced a half  chance. Long before the end Gordon and young Hazell had been played out  of the game by McNeill and George Connelly and only Arthur Duncan, on  the left, was a threat. Eventually he was injured and had to be  substituted. Connelly was a magnificent partner for McNeill.<br><br>The  four Hibs backs had much to contend with in the switching imps, Lou  Macari and Dixie Deans, and the jinking Johnstone and the probing of  Murdoch and the running of<i> </i>Callaghan but they coped commendably  well. Schaedler was the better full back for Brownlie, under pressure  lost composure. Black was safe but Blackley was more than that in skill  and competitiveness. <br><br>Blackley was Hibs&#39; most effective player  and had he been able to stick to his own job then Celtic would not have  found goal-scoring so easy. But when the midfield was lost he went  charging forward trying to get into the game. This was forced on him for  nobody else looked like shaking Celtic&#39;s defence.<br><br>In the later  stages when Hibs were trying to save face by pushing on they were at the  mercy of the long passes of Murdoch springing Macari and Deans.<br><br>This  Dixie Deans just can&shy;not keep out of the limelight. He enjoyed the  circumstances on Saturday for to score three goals in a Scottish Cup  final must be the ultimate in foot&shy;ball happiness. The second, in which  he beat Brownlie twice and Herriot twice, was one we longed to see in  action replay. Twice Macari came within an inch or two of matching the  three goals and that would have been the ultimate in wonder.<br><br>Stein  said yesterday. &quot;Let&#39;s take stock of the season, we won the League  championship and the Scottish Cup and we were in the final of the League  Cup and were not beaten in any of the European Cup matches. I think we  did all right.&quot;</div>  <div>  </div>  <div>  </div>  <div>  .</div>  <div>  At least Hibs were not beaten by mugs.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Glasgow Herald Monday May 8 1972</h3><br><br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="5"><b>Longstanding cup record equalled by six-goal Celtic</b></font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">By Jim Parkinson</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><b>Celtic 6, Hibernian 1</b></font> <br><br><b><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri">The  last time six goals were scored in a Scottish Cup final goes back  hazily to 1888, the year Celtic was instituted by Brother Walfrid as a  means of dispensing help to the needy and impover&shy;ished in Glasgow&#39;s  East End.</font></font></font></b> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Since  then the club have adhered to the basic principles of their origin,  widening the circle of their benevolence but without extending it to  rivals.</font> <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Celtic were  ruthlessly uncharitable to Hibernian at Hampden as they equalled the  long-forgotten record by Renton, the reputed world champions of their  day, and won the national trophy for the twenty-second time in their  history.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">This  final may be remarkable to the 106,102 spectators and the players and  officials for a variety of reasons, but I shall always recall it for  Cel&shy;tic&rsquo;s sheer simplicity in the art of goal-scoring. Such a lopsided  result could easily give the impression that the game ceased to be alive  long before the end, but the quality of those Celtic goals sustained  interest at an exciting peak throughout.</font> <br><br><b><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">ACHIEVEMENT</font></b> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">To  add such an astonishing cup success to their league championship  victory is an outstanding achievement for a team in the transitional  stage, remembering also that they reached the League Cup final and were  knocked out of their European Cup semi-final only on a technicality.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Dixie  Deans, whose miss in the deciding penalty series against Internationale  put Celtic out of the European tournament, more than atoned by scoring  three goals in his first Scottish Cup final &mdash; a feat made all the more  memorable by the way in which he scored his second. Had it been executed  by some one of the striking and dribbling prow&shy;ess of Jimmy Johnstone  it would have come as<b> n</b>o surprise, but three times Deans might  have lost the ball on a solo run which ended with his shooting the ball  emphatically into the net.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Deans and Jock Stein were, at the end,<b> </b>locked  in a bear-hug all the way from the pitch to the tunnel as Celtic  prepared to receive their medals. Stein, the architect of four other  Celtic Scottish Cup successes as well as another with Dunfermline  Athletic,<b> </b>had been proven right yet again, having decided early  in the week that Deans must play in the final, along with young Kenny  Dalglish, the only other player in the team who had not won a Scottish  Cup-winners&#39; medal.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">The  Celtic manager reckoned that both deserved their places on their  average ratings over the season, and after all they are two of the  players the club will depend on in the future.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Around  them they had other fine players, and none better than Bobby Murdoch.  He was Celtic&#39;s nerve-centre. The play pivoted around him in a steady  pattern and yet he was at a disadvantage, having taken a knee knock in  the first minute of the game.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Tommy  Callaghan, who masterfully controlled the midfield in partnership with  Murdoch, also was troubled by injury, suffered in the second minute of<i> </i>the  match just after McNeill had opened the scoring. The Hibs defence lined  up crazily for a free kick, and Celtic&#39;s captain ran in to side-foot  the ball into the net.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">This  goal acted as a tranquilliser to Celtic, and even though Alan Gordon  brought Hibs leveI minutes later, the Parkhead men calmly exhibited  their skills. Jimmy Johnstone had the freedom of the pitch and used it  effectively. It was a foul against him that led to the free kick for the  first goal, and he was brought down again on the other side of the  field in 24 minutes, with the result that Deans headed the<i> </i>next one.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><b>CONCUSSION </b></font><br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Hibs were left stranded. Determination and the strong Arthur Duncan<i> </i>&mdash; who, unfortunately was carried off with concussion in the second half &mdash; were the Edinburgh side&#39;s only assets,<b> </b>and  in an attempt to break Celtic&#39;s hold in midfield they even moved their  sweeper, John Blackley, into attack. Pat Stanton also went forward.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">This  gamble cruelly exposed further weaknesses in Hibs&#39; defence. Deans and  Lou Macari, wearing the No. 9 jersey, punched holes through the middle,  and Johnstone alternated on the wings to pressurise the full backs, John  Brownlie and Eric Schaedler.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">After  Deans had put the issue beyond recall with two more goals in the second  half, Celtic&#39;s defence had their concen&shy;tration disturbed by the crowd  behind their goal. Spectators fled<b> </b>to the safety of the track to  avoid flying bottles and beer cans, and youths from other sections of  the West terracing added to the commotion by joining in the rush, just  to be on the pitch.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Stanton  and Gordon had Hibs best scoring openings of the game at that point but  Evan Williams dealt capably with everything that came his way.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Celtic&#39;s  rear quartette, McNeill; Jim Brogan, George Connelly, and Jim Craig,  who was playing his last match for the Parkehead club, were utterly  composed, apart from this brief second-half spell, and Craig even found  time to help out his attackers. He had a big hand in the last two goals,  both scored by Macari.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Even the redoubtable men of Renton would have joined in the spontaneous ovation for Celtic had they been at Hampden on Saturday.</font> <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><div>  </div>  <div>  </div></div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  The Scotsman, Monday, May 8, 1972 (Page one). </h3><br><b><font size="4">Celtic manager hits out at TV coverage of cup finals</font></b>.<br><br>By John Rafferty <br><br>The  presentation of the Scottish Cup Final by the Scottish Football  Association and its treatment by tele&shy;vision were strongly criti&shy;cised  yesterday by the Celtic manager, Mr Jock Stein.<br><br>He said: &quot;The Scottish Cup Final is a national occasion but both downgraded it.&quot; <br><br>He  was shocked when the teams were sent on the field, just as in any  ordinary game, and the referee followed them later.

On Friday night there were interviews on television with the managers of<b> </b>the English finalists and interviews again on Saturday morning.

I met Alf once. He told me it was after I&rsquo;d played quite well in a  cup-tie against Manchester United that he decided to borrow my name. I  gave him one of my Scotland shirts and he gave me a signed first  edition. I&rsquo;m not much of a reader although I quite enjoyed the TV show.  Pets? I&rsquo;ve never been one for animals and Ann was the same.&rdquo;<br><br>This  is Herriot&rsquo;s wife who died three years ago. &ldquo;She was my biggest fan; I  miss her an awful lot,&rdquo; he adds, and breaks into another chuckle. &ldquo;When I  was at Dunfermline, playing against Rangers, I had to come off with  concussion. She was out front at East End as I was being carted into an  ambulance. I was in my usual green jersey and a Rangers fan who was  passing said something derogatory. Ann bashed him on the head with her  brolly.<br><br>&ldquo;Then there was the England-Scotland game at Wembley  [1969], the first evening Home International between the countries, and  unfortunately we lost 4-1. Afterwards Ann and I were with Jock Stein and  his wife; they&rsquo;d been guests at our wedding. Big Jock was blaming me  for one of England&rsquo;s goals and Ann wasn&rsquo;t standing for it, no matter the  man&rsquo;s reputation. She gave Big Jock what for.&rdquo;<br><br>Ann wore Jim&rsquo;s  medal round her neck, the badge from Hibs&rsquo; December 1972 League Cup  triumph, the year&rsquo;s third Hampden final between the greens. Hibs took  the Drybrough Cup as well but in the May, in front of a crowd of  106,101, a Dixie Deans-inspired Celtic ran out 6-1 winners for an 18th  Scottish Cup. Stein vs Eddie Turnbull was the classic dugout  confrontation of the age and Herriot, who lives in Larkhall,  Lanarkshire, played for them both.<br><br>&ldquo;Jock was a great manager and  Eddie was a great coach. Jock knew how to motivate and psyche you up,  whereas Eddie&rsquo;s man-management was virtually non-existent.&rdquo; Herriot had a  few fall-outs with the boss, wartime veteran of the Arctic Convoys, and  was once reprimanded: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare f****n&rsquo; swear at me!&rdquo; He adds:  &ldquo;But Eddie wasn&rsquo;t the least bit daunted by the Old Firm and always  thought we could beat them with our flair. In training, if the guys made  three or four square passes in a row, he&rsquo;d stop the session.&rdquo;<br><br>Herriot  recalls the Tornadoes by nickname: Onion (John Brownlie), Shades (Erich  Schaedler), Niddrie (Pat Stanton), Cilla (Jim Black), Sloop (John  Blackley), Mickey (Alex Edwards), Biffo (Jimmy O&rsquo;Rourke), Tosh (Alan  Gordon), Nijinsky (Arthur Duncan &ndash; &ldquo;or the Roadrunner; there was a guy  in the Easter Road enclosure who aye shouted &lsquo;Beep, beep!&rsquo; whenever we  sent Arthur away from our kick-off&rdquo;). Pung (John Hazel) deputised for  the injured Alex Cropley in the Scottish Cup final, but Sodjer was back  for the League Cup. And Herriot? &ldquo;At Dunfermline I was Kookie after the  detective in 77 Sunset Strip [a hotrod-driving hipster with a heavy  personal grooming regime] because I was aye combing my hair like him. At  Hibs I got another name. Alex Edwards said: &lsquo;You walk just like Robert  Mitchum &ndash; dead suave.&rsquo; So I became Big Bob.&rdquo; Edwards is one of the old  team-mates who regularly checks on his well-being. &ldquo;I aye know it&rsquo;s him  on the phone. He&rsquo;ll go: &lsquo;Is that the world&rsquo;s worst goalie?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell  him: &lsquo;And you&rsquo;re the crankiest wee bugger there&rsquo;s ever been&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br><br>But  here&rsquo;s a funny thing. Instead of picking the ball out of the Hibs net  six times 43 years ago, Big Bob could have been Celtic&rsquo;s &rsquo;keeper,  replacing Ronnie Simpson. &ldquo;Big Jock had saved my career at Dunfermline.  We had five goalies and I was heading out the door but he decided to  keep me and Eddie Connaghan. Then he tried to sign me for Celtic when I  was at Birmingham, only they wanted a bigger fee than Stoke paid  Leicester for Gordon Banks, and he eventually cooled on the idea. I was  amazed when he went for Evan Williams, who at that point was in Wolves&rsquo;  reserves.&rdquo;<br><br>Williams smiles at his rival&rsquo;s recollection when I  track him down in Dumbarton. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt Jim&rsquo;s version of events.  Yes, I did wonder why Wolves had bothered buying me [from Third Lanark]  but when I was out on loan to Aston Villa, Sean Fallon told me not to  sign for anyone else because Celtic would be coming.&rdquo; Was he intimidated  by having to fill Simpson&rsquo;s gloves? &ldquo;No, because I&rsquo;d had to follow  Jocky Robertson at Thirds, while at Wolves all I heard was the name Bert  Williams.&rdquo;<br><br>To show Stein what he was missing, Herriot always  wanted to put on a show against Celtic. &ldquo;Sometimes that was my downfall.  I did have some good games against them but other times I tried too  hard and made a fool of myself.&rdquo; In May &rsquo;72, he was undone by an old  trick. &ldquo;Billy McNeill scored from a header from a corner. Jock knew from  Dunfermline that I liked to come for crosses so he had Bobby Lennox  block me off. Exactly the same thing happened when Billy scored in the  &rsquo;65 final [Celtic 3, Pars 2] and if I remember right it was that bugger  Lennox again.&rdquo; Alan Gordon equalised but Celtic regained the lead before  the interval. Herriot again: &ldquo;In the second half Eddie had us really  attack them, leaving just three at the back. We had as many chances as  them, possibly more, but they were so clinical. I know this might sound  daft, given it finished 6-1, but we were quite unlucky.&rdquo;<br><br>Williams  would not disagree. &ldquo;Hibs had a great team back then. Even before that  final, after I&rsquo;d played my first ten games for Celtic and we&rsquo;d won them  all, we went to Easter Road and they beat us with two Joe McBride goals.  That brought us down to earth. I can name their entire &rsquo;72 side. [He  does]. Not bad, given I&rsquo;m 70 this summer. It tells you the quality they  had, at a time in the Scottish game when every team had some rare  players. I&rsquo;m not being patronising, but even at 4-1 Hibs were still in  that final. I was pretty pleased with my saves from wee Jimmy O&rsquo;Rourke  and that bag of tricks Alex ?Edwards. Even at 5-1 they kept coming at  us.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic had a great team, too: five Lisbon Lions plus Kenny  Dalglish, Lou Macari, George Connelly, Tom Callaghan and Hibee nemesis  Deans (18 goals in 13 games against them). &ldquo;We were lucky back then,&rdquo;  continues Williams. &ldquo;Well, not lucky, but we had Jinky who could beat  the opposition on his own and Dixie who on that day couldn&rsquo;t stop  scoring.&rdquo; For one of his goals Deans seemed to have been fired from a  circus cannon to connect with a wayward Johnstone shot with his head.  His next trick was impossible but &ndash; rounding Herriot twice and dumping  three international defenders on their backsides &ndash; he pulled it off. The  somersault celebration was less Olga Korbut, more Harry H. Corbett.<br><br>At  Hibs&rsquo; post-final dinner, Turnbull took the blame for the defeat through  his gung-ho tactics and vowed the Tornadoes would be back; they were.  At Celtic there was no real celebration, as was customary. Williams  again: &ldquo;The club won so much at that time and Jock didn&rsquo;t want us  getting blas&eacute;. I won four league championships but never once got to  hold the trophy and my four medals were given to me in a oner. Maybe  that&rsquo;s why, until recently, every one I won was kept in a Safeway bag.  Sorry to Hibs fans for that!&rdquo;<br><br>What&rsquo;s in a name? Evan Williams was  christened Samuel. Dixie Deans is really John. The Hibs goalie in &rsquo;72  has been called many things, and seen &ldquo;Jim Herriot&rdquo; grow into a highly  successful literary brand.
