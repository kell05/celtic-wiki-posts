Sean passed away peacefully earlier this morning (Friday), surrounded by his family.<br><br>Sean was a much-loved husband, father and grandfather, and he was also held in the highest esteem by the Celtic Family. Sean, a proud Irishman, was a wonderful and faithful servant of Celtic over many years, first as a player, making 254 appearances and scoring 14 goals, and then as assistant to Jock Stein during a golden era for the club.<br><br>Sean was also responsible for bringing many great players to Celtic much as Tommy Gemmell, Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalglish, Davie Hay, Lou Macari and Pat Bonner.<br><br>Celtic chief Executive Peter Lawwell said; &ldquo;This is very, very sad news and our thoughts are with Sean&rsquo;s wife, Myra, their children Marie-Therese, Louise, Collette, Siobhan, Sean and Sinead, and all of Sean&rsquo;s family and many friends.<br><br>&ldquo;Sean Fallon was a Celtic legend who devoted much of his life to the club he loved. He was, of course, a supporter, first and foremost, and he was proud to have worn the green and white Hoops that he loved.<br><br>&ldquo;He did so with fearless distinction over eight years in the 1950s, and Sean was at the heart of all of our triumphs, including that famous 7-1 League Cup victory in 1957.<br><br>&ldquo;Ten years later, he was part of our greatest ever success, winning the European Cup in Lisbon. Working alongside Jock Stein, Sean helped to deliver that trophy, along with nine consecutive league titles and numerous other trophies. He was an integral part of the club&rsquo;s success, and also played a vital role in identifying talented young players who would go on to become great Celts.<br><br>&ldquo;He was a gentleman with a great sense of humour, and always a welcome guest here at Celtic Park. And there could have been no more fitting person to unveil the championship flag at this start of this, our 125th anniversary season, than a man who gave so much to Celtic Football Club.<br><br>&ldquo;Sean will be sadly missed but he will never be forgotten for what he did for our club.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic manager, Neil Lennon said: &ldquo;We are all shocked and saddened to hear of Sean&rsquo;s death, and the thoughts of all the players and management are with his family.<br><br>&ldquo;Sean was a great Celtic man, and it&rsquo;s been a privilege to meet him over the years. He was always a very humble man when you met him, even though his achievements in the game were extraordinary.<br><br>&ldquo;He did everything you could ever wish to achieve in football, as a player for both club and country, while he went to even greater things in management alongside Jock Stein. For these things, the Celtic supporters have always loved Sean and recognised him as one of our own because it was always his great love of Celtic which shone through.<br><br>&ldquo;It was a fitting tribute that Sean unveiled the championship flag back in August and the welcome he received from the supporters spoke volumes. We will all miss him.&rdquo;<br><br>The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic, and indeed, the entire Celtic Family, are with Sean&rsquo;s family at this very sad time.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Sean Fallon &ndash; a man for the Celtic</h3>Celticfc.net<br>By: Joe Sullivan on 18 Jan, 2013 10:01<br><br>THE league flag flies over Paradise once again as the club celebrates its 43rd championship success in the club&rsquo;s 125th year &ndash; a flag that was unfurled by Celtic legend Sean Fallon at the start of the season.<br><br>He is a true Celtic great, having served the club faithfully as a player and then as an integral part of the management team.<br><br>As assistant manager to the legendary Jock Stein, the Irishman played an instrumental role in the extraordinary success Celtic enjoyed in the 1960s and &acute;70s, winning nine league championships in a row and, of course, lifting the European Cup on May 25, 1967.<br><br>Sean also, to paraphrase a famous Celtic song, brought some great names to the game, and we have him to thank for seeing the likes of Tommy Gemmell, Davie Hay, Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalgish, Lou Macari and Packy Bonner, amongst many others, play for Celtic.<br><br>Yet, this giant of a man has always remained humble and, indeed, grateful for having been able to play a part in the unique history of his beloved Celtic Football Club.<br><br>Sean Fallon was born in Sligo on July 31, 1922. As a player, he wore the Hoops between 1950 and 1958, making 255 appearances and scoring 13 goals. He was also capped eight times by the Republic of Ireland.<br><br>Sean&rsquo;s footballing career started with St Mary&rsquo;s Juniors, Sligo, and he also played Gaelic football for Craobh Ruadh. He went on to play for McArthurs, Sligo Distillery and Longford Town before he arrived at the Showgrounds in 1947 to play for Rovers.<br><br>He then joined Glenavon in the north before impressing Celtic with his performance for the Irish League against the League of Ireland.<br><br>Sean Fallon&acute;s Celtic connection started when Joe McMenemy, son of Jimmy McMenemy, saved Fallon&rsquo;s sister from drowning. McMenemy was invited back to the Fallons&acute; house, and Joe sent Sean a Celtic shirt and a copy of Willie Maley&acute;s book, &acute;The Story of the Celtic.&acute;<br><br>The Irishman went on to realise his ambition of playing for Celtic when he made his league debut for the Hoops, away to Clyde, in the last game of the 1949/50 season. At the end of season 1950/51, he earned his first piece of silverware by helping Celtic beat Motherwell in the Scottish Cup final.<br><br>By October 1953, Sean had been made club captain but broke a collarbone against Hearts which sidelined him for part of the season. In his absence, the captaincy was passed on to Jock Stein &ndash; at Sean&rsquo;s request.<br><br>At the end of season 1953/54, Celtic had secured the league and cup double, with Sean scoring in the 2-1 victory over Aberdeen at Hampden to clinch the Scottish Cup.<br><br>And he was also part of the famous team which retained the League Cup in 1957, in which Celtic beat Rangers 7-1. The club had won it for the first time in the previous season against Partick Thistle.<br><br>In 1958, he was forced to retire through injury but he remained an influential part of the club. When Jock Stein was appointed manager in 1965, Sean came in as his assistant, and he was responsible was bringing players like Tommy Gemmell, David Hay, Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalgish, Lou Macari and Packy Bonner to Celitc.<br><br>While Jock Stein was recovering from a car crash in 1975, Sean took control of the first-team as caretaker manager, and from 1976 he took over the position of Youth Development Officer.<br><br>He left Celtic in 1978 and became assistant manager of Dumbarton before becoming manager in 1980. In December that year, he even tried to tempt Johan Cruyff to Boghead for &pound;2,000, but the Dutchman turned him down to play for New York Cosmos.<br><br>Sean Fallon said of his time with Celtic: &ldquo;I was just an ordinary player with only a big heart and a fighting spirit to recommend men... I can never find words to express my feelings at becoming a member of the Celtic Football Club.&rdquo;<br><br>Sean Fallon was, is and always will be a true Celtic legend&hellip;.the thoughts and prayers of all at Celtic Football Club are with Sean&rsquo;s family at this sad time.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>McGrain: Sean Fallon was a Celtic great</h3>Celticfc.net<br>By: Mark Henderson on 18 Jan, 2013 15:09<br><br>SEAN Fallon was a warrior. His bravery on the pitch was renowned. Famously, even a broken arm never stopped him completing a game for his beloved Celtic. His commitment to the cause was absolute.<br><br>But once he was off the pitch, he was a gentleman, someone always willing to listen and offer advice. And this is how Danny McGrain will always fondly remember Sean Fallon.<br><br>The Irishman was a major influence on McGrain&acute;s career. He brought him to Paradise in the mid 1960s and was assistant manager for much of the full-back&acute;s Hoops career, as he went on to become one of the club&acute;s all-time greats.<br><br>Like the whole of the Celtic family, McGrain was deeply saddened at the news of Sean&acute;s passing this morning. He will never forget him.<br><br>&quot;I am at the age where you thought Sean and Mr Stein were indestructible &ndash; you could never imagine them ever going,&quot; McGrain told the official Celtic website. &quot;I only saw Sean about a month ago and he had to go away and have a smoke.<br><br>&quot;It was an in-joke, and I said to him, &acute;How it was good for his health&acute;. But Sean was 90 and he just took it like water off a duck&acute;s back, as he had got this far smoking.<br><br>&quot;Thankfully I wasn&rsquo;t around to play against him. He was a full-back who took no prisoners, and as a centre-forward he scored the winner in a cup final. The likes of Sean and Bobby Shearer at that time were solid players who gave everything on the park. Sean also gave everything off the park, and he has a great family as well.<br><br>&quot;Obviously, Sean brought me to the club and was here as assistant manager to Mr Stein and he would just always be there for you. If you wanted to talk to him, he would always take time to listen to you. He was just a great man.&quot;<br><br>By all accounts, Sean was also someone with a dry sense of humour, and that will be another of McGrain&acute;s abiding memories of him.<br><br>&quot;He was Irish and had great one-liners,&quot; he said. &quot;He would be in the background to Mr Stein but he was always working away at football matters, trying to bring the young players through.<br><br>&quot;Sean was Sean. I was at his 90th birthday party at the beginning of the season, and he was thoroughly enjoying himself. He was a great football person but also a great human being.<br><br>&quot;He had a sense of humour, was open to people and was kind. I don&acute;t think anyone had a bad word to say about Sean. He was such a friendly guy. I will miss him.<br><br>&quot;I didn&rsquo;t see him that often because of his age, but you could phone him or Myra up, or meet his son Sean and ask how he is. He will be greatly missed by his family, and he will go down as one of the Celtic greats.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Neil Lennon pays tribute to a Celtic icon</h3>Celticfc.net<br>By: Mark Henderson on 18 Jan, 2013 17:31<br><br>NEIL Lennon has paid tribute to Sean Fallon after the Celtic legend passed away early this morning, aged 90.<br><br>Sean was a faithful servant to the club for many years. As a player he was renowned for his courage and commitment, making 255 appearances and scoring 13 goals.<br><br>He then moved to the dugout and became Jock Stein&acute;s trusted lieutenant during Celtic&acute;s golden era in the late 1960s and early &acute;70s.<br><br>The Irishman was also responsible for bringing many great players to Paradise including Tommy Gemmell, Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalglish, Davie Hay, Lou Macari and Pat Bonner.<br><br>&quot;The club has lost a great icon, a great servant over the years and someone who was a gentleman,&quot; said the manager, speaking at today&acute;s media conference at Lennoxtown.<br><br>&quot;I met him on numerous occasions and he was always bright as button despite the fact he was getting on a little bit but he kept a sharp wit and sharp mind.<br><br>&quot;It&acute;s a very sad day. He was a great ambassador and servant for the club for such a long time. Obviously my thoughts go out to the family as well, and also on behalf of the playing staff and backroom staff as well. It&acute;s a huge loss for the club today.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>One of Celtic&#39;s most undervalued figures, Sean Fallon&#39;s was the great untold story</h3>Obituary<br>Published on 19 January 2013<br>Stephen Sullivan<br><br>The Sean Fallon you will read about in today&#39;s obituaries is the devoted Celtic servant, the faithful right-hand man and fearless player.<br><br>Delve into any Celtic history and, accompanying his name, you&#39;ll see the same adjectives: &quot;reliable&quot;, &quot;honest&quot;, &quot;solid&quot;, &quot;wholehearted&quot;. And it&#39;s true that he was all of these things. But he was also so much more.<br>Over the past year, I had the privilege of working with him on an autobiography. Even before taking a single note, I considered his to be the great untold Celtic story and Fallon to be one of the club&#39;s most influential and undervalued figures. I&#39;ll admit now that I didn&#39;t know the half of it.<br><br>I was aware, of course, that he had scouted and recruited several Celtic greats, and that all but one of the Lisbon Lions had been in place by the time Jock Stein arrived. I&#39;d heard the famous story of him leaving his wife in the car &ndash; on their wedding anniversary, no less &ndash; to conclude unexpectedly lengthy signing talks with Kenny Dalglish.<br><br>But I would not have dared suggest Fallon had signed more world-class players than anyone in Celtic&#39;s history, save for the possible exception of Willie Maley. Now I have no hesitation in doing so. In fact, the names &ndash; Simpson, Gemmell, Auld, Murdoch, Dalglish, McGrain, Macari, Connelly, Hay and McStay &ndash; speak for themselves. Essentially, Fallon recruited most of one European Cup-winning team, then assembled another &ndash; arguably more talented &ndash; only to see them sold off before their potential could be realised.<br><br>Jock Stein recognised his eye for talent, trusted in it, and was richly rewarded. Fallon had free rein to recruit young players and was a constant companion on the manager&#39;s trips to assess signing targets and European opponents. Back at Celtic Park, he played an equally important role in soothing friction with the players, all of whom mention the Irishman&#39;s uncanny knack of knowing when to heal Stein-inflicted wounds. &quot;Big Jock didn&#39;t do peacemaking,&quot; explains Billy McNeill. &quot;Sean, with that Irish charm, was born for it. There would have been many more fall-outs without him around.&quot;<br><br>Even the relationship between Stein and Fallon has its surprises. It&#39;s no secret they worked well and closely together, but the extent of their friendship and ways in which their careers were intertwined is remarkable. I had no idea their families would enjoy day trips to the coast together, or that Stein &ndash; &quot;Uncle Jock&quot; &ndash; would accompany Fallon on the morning school run. <br><br>Fallon was the junior partner in their working relationship, but he was a man to whom Stein had been indebted since December 13, 1952. That was the date on which Fallon was made Celtic captain, recognising his position among the club&#39;s most established and influential players. Stein, by contrast, had joined just 12 months earlier and was still scrapping to earn a regular first-team place amid scepticism about his age and ability. Nonetheless, in selecting his deputy, the new captain opted not for established internationals such as Bobby Evans or Bertie Peacock, but for the journeyman centre-half just signed from non-league Llanelli. An injury to Fallon meant Stein took the armband just weeks later, and the rest forms the greatest chapter in the club&#39;s history. &quot;A lot of people weren&#39;t happy with my choice,&quot; Fallon would recall. &quot;But I saw something special in Jock.&quot;<br><br>Not for the last time, Fallon had been the first to identify extraordinary talent. Indeed, it was this same appreciation of Stein&#39;s unique abilities that enabled Fallon to selflessly and willingly stand aside in 1965 when his old pal was given the job he had been groomed for. &quot;I could see that Jock was what Celtic needed,&quot; was his explanation.<br><br>The man with the inimitable, gravelly Sligo accent enjoyed a unique perspective on the most turbulent and successful period in the club&#39;s history, and shared with Neilly Mochan the distinction of having played his part in its two greatest triumphs. But while his contribution to Lisbon and the 7-1 win over Rangers was considerable, it would be a mistake to conclude Fallon&#39;s story begins and ends with black-and-white images and long-gone glories. He left Celtic with their best player of the 1980s and 90s in Paul McStay, and at Dumbarton maintained his knack for unearthing talent by signing the teenage Graeme Sharp and Owen Coyle. Sir Alex Ferguson, a long-standing friend, credits Fallon with having a major influence on the early stages of his managerial career. <br><br>If you&#39;re wondering why someone so extraordinary is consistently portrayed merely as &quot;trustworthy&quot; and &quot;dependable&quot;, it is because his humility facilitated this typecasting. And perhaps that&#39;s what impressed me most about Fallon. Ask him about Dalglish and McGrain and he would say, &quot;Ah, they were Celtic&#39;s signings, son. Not Sean Fallon&#39;s.&quot; Enquire about his playing achievements and he would stress how much better others were. Discuss the shabby way he was treated at the end and he would lament only that his departure broke Celtic&#39;s historic links with Sligo. <br><br>Fortunately, the men who worked with him had no such reservations. It had been my great hope that Sean would be recognised for the giant he is while still alive, through their words and this book &ndash; his book. But I realise now that&#39;s not important. Public recognition something he never craved. Sean Fallon died peacefully with his beloved family gathered round him, having enriched the lives of all those fortunate enough to have known him. Nothing I or anyone else could write can ever compete with that.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic favourite Fallon dies</h3>Evening Times<br>Former Celtic player and coach Sean Fallon has died at the age of 90, the club confirmed today.<br><br>Fallon made more than 250 appearances for Celtic during the 1950s and was assistant manager to Jock Stein throughout the most successful spell in the club&#39;s history.<br><br>The club announced on their Twitter feed: &quot;Celtic legend Sean Fallon has died peacefully at the age of 90.

In the 1940&rsquo;s Sean&rsquo;s sister Lily almost drowned in Lough Gill (a freshwater lake in County Sligo) and she was only saved by the intervention of Joe McMenemy who was the son of the Celtic legend Jimmy McMenemy.<br><br>Fate had it that Joe was over in Sligo on holiday and the Fallon family gave Joe a warm welcome after his fine deed. Joe in turn sent the Fallon&rsquo;s a Celtic jersey and Willie Maley&rsquo;s book by return and Sean was then destined to be a Celt for life.<br><br>Sean became a footballer with Glenavon and the call came from Celtic in 1950. Principally a left back, Sean was a versatile player who could play up front when required and had a ferocious will to win. So much so that he became famous for his hard, but fair, tackling style. <br><br>Many years ago I recall my Father and his friends discussing Sean and they spoke of the day he collided with another tough player, Sammy Baird of Rangers. It is said that when the two of them collided going for a ball it was akin to an explosion on the field of play. Sean came out first in this battle of the hard men and I put this to the back of my mind. Then earlier this year there was a thread on Kerrydale Street and several old timers recalled this tale in the same fashion. Sean Fallon seldom came out second best in any tussle.<br><br>Sean had many highlights in his playing days. In 1954 he had the privilege of scoring the winning goal against Aberdeen in the Scottish cup final and in 1957 he was part of the legendary Celtic side who annihilated the old Rangers by 7-1 in the League cup final.<br><br>Because of his good service to the club Sean was made assistant to manager Jimmy McGrory and then in 1965 chairman Robert Kelly wanted to make Sean manager with Jock Stein as assistant or have both as joint managers. As it happens Sean became Jock&rsquo;s assistant and was a trusted and loyal lieutenant to the big man for many years.<br><br>There was something comforting for Celtic fans during that era when they looked to the bench and saw Stein, Fallon, Bob Rooney, Neilly Mochan and Willie Fernie, every one of them a Celtic man to the core. Never have Celtic had more learned men in charge of their playing affairs.<br><br>Sean&rsquo;s signing of the younger players through the years became the thing of legend. In 1965 he poached young Davie Hay in an Edinburgh hotel under the nose of Chelsea manager Tommy Docherty, a fact that the Doc rues to this very day.<br><br>The stories of Kenny Dalglish tearing down his Rangers posters in his house have become grossly exaggerated through the years. Any allegiance to another team would not have concerned Sean but what should have been his concern was the fact he left his wife, Myra, in the car whilst he negotiated the young Dalglish&rsquo;s signature. And this was on the night of his wedding anniversary when they were on their way out for a meal ! This was another example of Sean&rsquo;s devotion to Celtic.<br><br>Many players have spoken about Stein&rsquo;s abrasiveness through the years and Sean was the ideal man to mediate and make others see reason and the Celtic players held him in the highest regard. Despite being in the background his importance to Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever period of success should not be under estimated.<br><br>In 1975 after Stein&rsquo;s near fatal car crash Sean was made caretaker manager for the 1975/76 season. His first act was a considerable one, to persuade the restless Dalglish stay for the next two seasons. Although Celtic finished the season trophy less they had performed well in spells during a period of great transition where they had lost the services of Stein, McNeill, Johnstone, Brogan and Connelly for various reasons.<br><br>As was the way in those days the Celtic did not always treat their great servants with the respect they deserved. In 1976 Sean was demoted to chief scout with Davie McParland appointed as Stein&rsquo;s assistant manager. He later said that this had &lsquo;hurt deep in the heart.&rsquo; In 1978 Stein was replaced by McNeill and Sean moved on. He was not sad at any personal loss but sad that Celtic had lost the &lsquo;Sligo connection&rsquo; as Brother Walfrid had been born in Sligo and Sean was enormously proud of the club&rsquo;s Sligo links.<br><br>Over the years Sean was always a popular visitor to Parkhead, none more so than in August of last year when he unfurled the League flag at Celtic Park, always a great Celtic event.

His sister Lily was saved from drowning at Lough Gill by the son of a Celtic player, Jimmy McMenemy, who was holidaying in Sligo. McMenemy subsequently befriended the Fallon family and on his return to Scotland he sent young Sean a Celtic jersey and a book on the club&#39;s history. From that moment, it was Fallon&#39;s ambition to play for the club.<br><br>Fallon was a supporter who was lucky enough to live the dream. But his route to Celtic Park was circuitous. He played in the League of Ireland for Longford Town, Sligo Distillery and Sligo Rovers, before crossing the Border to play with Glenavon in Co Armagh.<br><br>Fallon was 26 when Celtic finally came calling. Convinced that the Parkhead club would not sign him if they knew his real age, Fallon told the Celtic manager, Jimmy McGrory, that he was only 22! Fallon admitted years later that thereafter &quot;I had two passports &ndash; one for football and the real one&quot;.<br><br>He scored an own goal on his Celtic debut in 1950, but by the following season he had established himself as a first-team regular and won a Scottish Cup medal. He scored the winning goal in the 1954 Scottish Cup Final and he also picked up his only Scottish League Championship medal that season.<br><br>He won two League Cups medal and secured his place in Celtic folklore by playing on the team that hammered Rangers 7-1 in the 1957 final. A wholehearted and versatile player, Fallon made 256 appearances for Celtic. He was also capped eight times by the Republic of Ireland.<br><br>Fallon&#39;s name will forever by indelibly linked with the legendary manager Jock Stein. As a managerial double act, only Brian Clough and Peter Taylor could credibly compete. The Celtic team shaped by Stein and Fallon in the mid-1960s went on to win an incredible nine league titles in a row, but their greatest achievement was their victory in the European Cup Final in 1967. Their opponents, Inter Milan, had won the European Cup in two of the last three seasons, but they were thoroughly outclassed by what was essentially a Glasgow and District XI.<br><br>When one considers the hundreds of millions of euroteams pay today to import top international talent, Stein and Fallon&#39;s achievement in winning the European Cup with 11 locally nurtured players is a monumental coaching accomplishment which is unlikely to ever be matched.<br><br>Fallon lived and breathed football. He spent a considerable amount of time at schoolboy and junior games. He was a talent scout supreme. His ability to spot a potential star and his powers of persuasion were instrumental in a host of brilliant young players signing for Celtic, including Danny McGrain, Davie Hay, Lou Macari and Packie Bonner.<br><br>He famously missed his own wedding anniversary celebrations because he had been delayed persuading a promising prospect, who supported Rangers, to put pen to paper for Celtic. The name of this schoolboy footballer was Kenny Dalglish.<br><br>In 2002, Fallon was awarded the freedom of his native Sligo. In August 2012, he received the accolade of being asked to unfurl the Scottish Premier League Title flag at Celtic Park that his beloved club had secured the previous season. The &#39;Iron Man&#39; received a tremendous standing ovation. He will be mourned by football supporters everywhere.<br><br>Ar dheis De go raibh a ainm dilis.<br><br>Brian Murphy is a life-long Celtic supporter.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class="diffAdd">Farewell to Sean Fallon</span></h3><span class="diffAdd"> 	                                    By: Newsroom Staff on 23 Jan, 2013 13:55 	                                    THE  Requiem Mass for Celtic legend, Sean Fallon, was held this morning at  Christ the King in Kings Park where an overspill hall had to be used  where those paying their respects could watch on large screens.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">  A host of Celtic players past and present along with manager Neil  Lennon, Peter Lawwell and club directors were there at the service  before moving on to Philipshill Cemetery for the funeral.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">  At the service the Eulogies were read by Sean Fallon junior and Alex  Ferguson who both recounted just some of the great moments in Sean&rsquo;s  life and career.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">  The thoughts and prayers of all at Celtic Park remain with the Fallon family at this sad time.</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">  FIFA President mourns Celtic legend Fallon</span><br></h3><span class="diffAdd">(FIFA.com) Wednesday 23 January 2013</span><br><span class="diffAdd">FIFA President mourns Celtic legend Fallon</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic lost one of its legends last week when Republic of Ireland international passed away on Friday at the age of 90.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Born  in Sligo on 31 July 1922, Fallon played for Celtic between 1950 and  1958, making 254 appearances for the club and scoring 14 goals. .</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">As  assistant manager to the legendary Jock Stein between 1965 and 1978, he  was instrumental in helping Celtic secure nine league championships in a  row and the European Cup in 1967.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Fallon also brought names  including Tommy Gemmell, Davie Hay, Danny McGrain, Kenny Dalglish, Lou  Macari and Pat Bonner to the club.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Youth development work such as that carried out by Mr Fallon to such good effect continues to be important to this day.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Joseph S.

Photograph: SMG/Press Association</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sean Fallon, who has died aged 90, was assistant to the Celtic manager Jock Stein throughout a glorious era when the Glasgow club became the first in Britain to win the European Cup and achieved a record-breaking nine successive Scottish League titles. Fallon&#39;s association with Celtic spanned seven decades, from signing as a player in 1950 to receiving an emotional reception when unfurling the League flag over Celtic Park at the start of the current season. All that time in Scotland never diluted the rich accent of his native Sligo.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Of the team who defeated Inter Milan in Lisbon in 1967 to win the European Cup, 10 had been signed before Stein&#39;s return to Celtic as manager two years earlier. While Stein&#39;s genius lay in turning a squad of players, all from within 40 miles of Glasgow, into a world-beating side, the role of Fallon in assembling it was crucial.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Like many young Irishmen, Fallon was forced into a choice between Gaelic football, in which he excelled, and the association code. As a rugged defender, he signed for Sligo Rovers in the League of Ireland and then Glenavon in Northern Ireland, quickly attracting attention from across the water.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Fallon had been educated in Sligo by Catholic Marist Brothers and was familiar with the role of Brother Walfrid, a Marist from Ballymote, County Sligo, in the foundation of Celtic for charitable purposes in the East End of Glasgow. There was, he said, no other club he wanted to play for.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">This was just as well, since Celtic&#39;s signing-on terms were less than generous. The manager, Jimmy McGrory, offered Fallon &pound;10 a week, falling to &pound;8 in the close season. At that time, he was earning &pound;6 with Glenavon and &pound;8 in his trade as a confectioner, but the lure of Celtic was strong enough to seal the move.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">While McGrory was nominal manager and a revered former player, it was Celtic&#39;s chairman, Bob Kelly, who called the shots in all aspects of the club&#39;s affairs. Kelly was a devout Catholic and marked 1950, Holy Year, with a European tour which culminated in an audience with Pope Pius XII.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Fallon recalled that this involved a cross-Channel ferry on which Bing Crosby was a fellow passenger. By the time they reached port, Crosby was singing I Belong to Glasgow at the bar. After a three-day train journey, a solitary game with Lazio was followed by the appointment at St Peter&#39;s &ndash; the true purpose of the expedition.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">This curious close-season tour was indicative of the way Celtic operated and was reflected in an increasingly bleak record of success. However, seeds of future glory were sown with the recruitment of Stein from the obscurity of Welsh non-league football. When Fallon suffered injury in 1953, Stein &ndash; whom he had nominated &ndash; succeeded him as team captain.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Fallon made 254 Celtic appearances and was known as &quot;the Iron Man&quot; in tribute to his uncompromising style. He won just one League and two Scottish Cup medals, as well as eight Irish caps. The highlight of his playing career was as a member of the team that beat Rangers 7-1 in the League Cup final of 1957-58.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Fallon joined the backroom staff and, along with Stein, developed a youth policy that was to prove highly fruitful, yielding such eventual Lisbon Lions as Billy McNeill, John Clark and Bertie Auld. With Stein&#39;s departure in 1960 to manage Dunfermline and then Hibs, Fallon became assistant to McGrory and established his reputation as a spotter of exceptional talent.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He was mooted as McGrory&#39;s successor but showed no resentment when Stein was brought back. The two retained a close personal bond and acted as perfect foils &ndash; Fallon the quietly spoken conciliator while the harder-edged Stein dealt brusquely with those who merited his ire. Fallon was instrumental in signing another generation of Celtic stars including David Hay, Kenny Dalglish and Paul McStay.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">When Stein suffered a serious car accident in 1975, Fallon became temporary manager, but the longer-term appointment fell to Billy McNeill and Fallon departed. He had a brief managerial spell with Dumbarton but maintained ties with Celtic, where he was treasured as a gentleman of the game.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In 2002, Fallon received the freedom of Sligo. He is survived by his wife, Myra, five daughters and a son.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&bull; Sean Fallon, footballer and coach, born 31 July 1922; died 18 January 2013  </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div>
