That was Hollywood and a piece of fantasy. This was Glasgow and too much reality.&quot; - Tom English (BBC)</li><li>  UEFA Cup, Europa League Group Stages, Round 4 of games<br></li><li>Celtic bottom of group and Molde top. Ajax <span class="diffRemove">Fernerbahce</span><span class="diffAdd">Fenerbah&ccedil;e</span> draw nil nil other game. <br></li><li>At outset a vital game to win else most certainly out of European competition before Xmas. With this defeat there is only an outside chance to qualify through to the KO stages. <br></li><li>Molde have now beaten Celtic twice in a row, scoring four goals over Celtic and are mid table in Norway. Shambolic. Celtic have slipped badly. <br></li><li>Only good point was great performance by the mercurial Kieran Tiernay. Likely to become first choice left back ahead of Izaguirre. <br></li><li>Nir Bitton signs new long term contract. Good news as he&#39;s been our best player this season.<br></li><li>Rangers(OldCo): HMRC win their appeal against Rangers, and effectively state it was &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; that taxes should have been paid and they cheated, and players wouldn&rsquo;t have come to Rangers without it. Major ruling. They cheated and finally justice is being served.<br></li><li>Delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Drummond Young said: &ldquo;That accords with common sense. If the law were otherwise, an employee could readily avoid tax by redirecting income to members of his family to meet outgoings that he would normally pay: for example to a trust for his wife...or to trustees to pay for his children&rsquo;s education or the outgoings on the family home&hellip;The funds are ultimately derived as consideration for the employee&rsquo;s services, and on that basis they are properly to be considered emoluments or earnings.&rdquo;<br></li><li>So will the titles they earned during the period of EBT&rsquo;s be stripped off them?<br></li><li>Rangers Newco reveal financial year loss of &pound;7.5m.<br></li><li>And icing on the cake, arch hun Andy Goram had his driving licence revoked. Happy days.   </li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Review<img align="right" alt="[Untitled]" height="210" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/f8d00cf932d426c89cdb1cb53339b11b/GW296H210" title="[Untitled]" width="296"></font></h3>(mubo l of KDS)<br>First and foremost I&#39;d like to congratulate Molde on their thoroughly deserved victory and qualification to the Last 32. I hope their travelling support enjoyed the fireworks emanating from the Glesga skyline, I sure as hell didn&#39;t.<br><br>Kieran Tierney okay enough of the positives.<br><br>Aside from the first 10 minutes of either half, we were a shambles. Tierney aside, no player imposed themself. There was a collective lack of desire, no leadership whatsoever. Passing was sloppy, defending utterly diabolical. Clearly that risk on Jozo paid off big time. And as for Boyata-Blackett? Possibly the worst centre back pairing we&#39;ve had in a European group game this century. A man of 40 years and 3 months scoring the decisive winner really took the biscuit, although said 40 year old bossing our midfield actually took the piss.<br><br>Speaking of Blackett, as awful as he was, to take him off and switch Bitton to centre back in an attempted 3-5-2 reshuffle was tactically embarrassing. For that alone, the red card was merited... oh and Johansen is now suspended, now all bad I s&#39;ppose. Full time booing was also justified.<br><br>Even putting aside the feat of losing at home to a 6th placed Norwegian team (again), tonight was soul destroying. Especially the last 10 minutes when Molde started the ole&#39;s for Ole, and humiliated Celtic in the process. I felt exactly the same way at Murrayfield last year when Legia destroyed us, on the park at least.<br><br>Whether in the current PLC structure or otherwise, Deila cannot be trusted any longer. The day after Sunday&#39;s trip to the Highlands would be an ideal time to sack the coaching staff as we have an upcoming 2 week break before our next game. We need to bed in the new manager, so that whoever they are have months and not weeks - as well as a January transfer window - to build ahead of next season&#39;s qualifiers. On the plus side, they won&#39;t be too expensive to bin. Oh and none of the above will happen, I fully expect Deila to be given til the end of the season because we don&#39;t have the guts to sack the wrong man because he happens to lead a one horse race. <br><br>Oh well.<br><br>And on the night of our worst European defeat at Parkhead this century, just 3 years after we beat Barcelona on route to the Last 16, Ronny was asked whether Molde are a better team than Celtic Football Club. His response?<br><br>&quot;Yeah they have shown that now&quot;<br><br>I think that says it all.<br><br>#BecauseCeltic <br><br><br>(Beaumont B of KDS)<br>truly woeful and gutless teirney aside. boyata, rogic and bitton at least didn&#39;t hide although all 3 were dreadful. the rest hide like scared little kids running from the boogie man. until johansson got booked on 66mins i forget he was playing he was hiding so much. i wanted blackett ahead of efe but by christ he was awful. he made boyata look like ramos in comparison. i would not be surprised if he never plays for us again.<br><br>ronny i am sorry but you are looking more and more like mowbury from the poor selections, weird substitutions, lack of shape and looking frankly gormless at the touchline. time to go <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Teams</font></h3><div class="home-team"> </div><h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3><div class="home-team"> </div><div class="home-team"><ul class="player-list"> <li>01 Gordon </li> <li>23 Lustig Booked </li> <li>20 Boyata </li> <li>05 Simunovic (Blackett - 9&#39;

Despite being bottom of Group A with just two points, victories at home to Ajax and away to Fenerbahce in their remaining two fixtures would take them through. But there is little evidence to support belief that scenario could play out.<br> <br> Celtic will face Ajax in three weeks&rsquo; time without Nir Bitton, sent off in the closing stages last night, and Stefan Johansen who collected his third booking of the tournament. It was a night when almost anything which could go wrong for Celtic did go wrong.<br> As much as his own players were the architects of their defensive downfall yet again at this level, Deila would also have felt the footballing fates were conspiring against him in the opening stages of a tumultuous contest.<br> Just four minutes in, Jozo Simunovic collapsed on the turf following a challenge by Tommy Hoiland. The Croatian central defender had been a doubtful starter because of an ankle injury and, after lengthy treatment, he was unable to continue.<br> Deila opted for Tyler Blackett, rather than the error-prone Efe Ambrose, to come off the bench to replace Simunovic alongside Dedryck Boyata in the heart of his back four.<br> </font><font face="Helvetica"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> Celtic thought they had responded to that early disruption in the best possible fashion when Nir Bitton&rsquo;s shot from distance beat Molde goalkeeper Ethan Horvath and nestled in the corner of the net in the tenth minute.<br> But their celebrations were halted by an offside flag against Leigh Griffiths who was lurking around the six-yard box in front of Horvath.<br> The frustration of the home support and players intensified when Griffiths was ruled offside again two minutes later, this time when he netted from close range after Horvath parried a Kris Commons shot.<br> Celtic had at least opened up firmly on the front foot but it did not take long for Molde to expose the all-too-familiar vulnerability of Deila&rsquo;s team at the other end of the pitch.<br> </font><font face="Helvetica"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> There was a let-off for the hosts when Hoiland was allowed to race clear on goal, only a poor touch from the Molde striker denying him a clear shooting chance.<br> But the visitors were not so wasteful when presented with their next opportunity in the 21st minute. It was a horrible moment for Blackett as the on-loan Manchester United player sent a defensive header tamely into the path of Mohamed Elyounoussi.<br> The forward had time to steady himself on the edge of the box and guide a curling right-foot shot beyond Craig Gordon&rsquo;s left hand and into the corner of the net.<br> In a contest which was compelling to watch, as much for the haphazard nature of both teams&rsquo; play as for any great quality on view, Celtic&rsquo;s response was frantic and brought them an equaliser five minutes later.<br> Kieran Tierney, preferred to Emilio Izaguirre at left-back, hoisted in a good cross which Vegard Forren was unable to clear properly.</font><font size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica"><br></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> The ball fell to Bitton whose 25-yard shot was not cleanly struck, but the ball was diverted by Commons&rsquo; instinctive flick beyond the wrong-footed Horvath.<br> A shocking error by Horvath should have led to Celtic taking the lead in the 32nd minute, his poor kick-out going straight to Tom Rogic.<br> The Australian was unable to capitalise, though, his shot parried by the scrambling &rsquo;keeper. The ball broke to Commons whose shot was blocked on the line by Daniel Hestad.<br> If that was an heroic contribution to his team&rsquo;s cause by Molde captain Hestad, the veteran midfielder bettered it when he put them 2-1 in front five minutes later.<br> It was another calamity at the back for Celtic as Elyounoussi was allowed to muscle his way to the byeline on the right-hand side of the penalty area.<br> His lofted pass to the far post found 40-year-old Hestad stretching his right boot beyond the unconvincing challenge of Blackett to force the ball home from close range.<br> Celtic were forced into another change at half-time, Commons failing to reappear for the second half as he was replaced by James Forrest.<br> Tierney forced Horvath into a smart save following a positive run and shot by the teenager but Molde continued to look likely to inflict damage with every counter-attack. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer introduced Ola Kamara, so dangerous in Norway two weeks ago, for Hoiland to refresh his team&rsquo;s attacking threat.<br> Mikael Lustig, captain again for Celtic in the absence of the injured Scott Brown, thought he had dragged his team level when he met a Stuart Armstrong cross with a sweet header but he was denied by a brilliant reaction save by the erratic Horvath.<br> Celtic came close again from the resulting corner kick, whipped in from the right by Griffiths, when Bitton saw his close range effort scrambled off the line.<br> Nothing was going right for Deila&rsquo;s men and Johansen triggered a suspension when he was booked for a foul on Elyounoussi, ruling him out of the visit of Ajax. Griffiths then passed up a glorious opportunity to make it 2-2. Picked out by Johansen&rsquo;s pass, Celtic&rsquo;s top scorer had beaten the offside trap this time but shanked his close-range shot wide. The tale of woe continued with Bitton&rsquo;s dismissal 14 minutes from time, the Israeli shown a straight red card for hauling down Kamara with the Molde substitute poised to race clear on goal.<br> As Molde saw out the first victory ever by a Norwegian team on Scottish soil, it all added up to another desolate night for the country&rsquo;s eve- diminishing reputation in Europe.<br> SCORERS: Celtic - Commons (26&rsquo;); Molde - Elyounoussi (21&rsquo;), D.Hestad (37&rsquo;)<br> Referee: S.Vincic (Slovenia)<br> CELTIC: Gordon, Lustig, Boyata, Simunovic (Blackett 9) (Ciftci 69), Tierney; Bitton, Johansen; Commons (Forrest 46), Rogic, Armstrong; Griffiths.

This was Glasgow and too much reality.<br><br>We&#39;re in the 36th minute of Celtic&#39;s Europa League contest with Molde and it&#39;s 1-1. Etzaz Hussain chips a cross to the home team&#39;s far post and suddenly it&#39;s 6am and we&#39;re listening to Sonny &amp; Cher&#39;s &quot;I Got You Babe&quot;.<br><br>Same lack of concentration in the Celtic defence as before on these nights, the same inability to make a tackle count, the same blind spot to the runners, the same endgame, when Daniel Hestad shows more hunger than the last witless Celtic defender, Tyler Blackett, and almost karate-kicks the ball into Craig Gordon&#39;s net.<br><br>As a goal, it was an abomination. Another one. Under Deila, there is a catalogue of such moments in Europe.<br><br>Wind the play backwards, slow it down and freeze it at the moment when Hussain delivers the ball and you&#39;re reminded of all those mishaps against Legia and Maribor, Salzburg and Zagreb, Malmo and Molde the first time round. <br><br> Nothing changes.<br><br>There are eight Celtic men in the penalty area and four Molde attackers. When Mohamed Elyounoussi gets the better of Tom Rogic, there are four Celtic men in the six-yard box and one Molde attacker.<br><br>When Elyounoussi dinks in his cross to the back post, Blackett is goal-side of Hestad and seemingly in a good position to deal with it. With the ball heading into their airspace, Hestad becomes active and Blackett becomes passive.<br><br>There&#39;s only one winner and it&#39;s the guy with the heart to get there. The guy in blue. The guy who wants it more.<br><br>As the ball hits the net, there are eight Celtic men in camera shot and three from Molde. Out-numbered more than two-to-one and still they score.<br><br>Deila always calls it as he sees it.

And this is it. Losing head-wreckingly cheap goals in Europe is their norm now. Failing to win against this type of opposition is the way of things.<br><br>Nights like Thursday are not the exception at Celtic any more, they&#39;re the rule.<br><br>They&#39;ve had three shots at the Champions League under Deila and they&#39;ve flunked all three. Now they have no wins from four in their Europa League group.<br><br>In their last half-dozen matches in Europe, they have conceded 13 goals. More than two a game. They&#39;re going out there with a psychology of having to score three to win a match.<br><br>At what point does Deila stop kidding himself into thinking that his team are better than they are and accept that this is what they&#39;ve become?<br><br>He plaintively suggested that Celtic&#39;s qualification hopes are still alive, that they are capable of victories over Ajax in Glasgow and Fenerbahce in Istanbul in the last two rounds in the group. Deila is seeing things that most others can&#39;t see.<br><br>His team have won just two games out of 12 in the Europa League on his watch. They have yet to win away from home in this competition in his time.<br><br>In their last seven games, they have taken three points from a possible 21, so the notion of six from six in the coming weeks is one he&#39;ll find hard to sell.<br><br>There was something else that Deila said in the wake of the defeat by the sixth-best team in Norway. &quot;All the time we analyse what we are doing.&quot; It was a straightforward statement and one you wouldn&#39;t normally highlight, if it wasn&#39;t for what Deila had said the day before.<br><br>He said he didn&#39;t analyse the previous match with Molde, a 3-1 horror show a few weeks back. He took the DVD, crushed it up and threw it in the garbage. &quot;That was not Celtic,&quot; he remarked on Wednesday.<br><br>The point he was making was that it was worthless watching that error-strewn performance and trying to learn from it because it was so out of character. It was a one-off, a bad day that wouldn&#39;t be repeated. Hence, no point wasting time looking at it.<br><br>&quot;Some managers would go through it all again, but they are not the best ones, I can assure you,&quot; he said. <br><br> The counter argument would be that the &quot;best ones&quot; would study the DVD from sun-down to sun-up to figure out what went wrong so that they could put the fixes in place.<br><br>The &quot;best ones&quot; are obsessional about detail and excellent at imparting knowledge to their players in a way that is easy to understand. The &quot;best ones&quot; somehow manage to simplify complicated game-plans and make them work.<br><br>Now that his team have made the same kind of cataclysmic errors as they did in Molde and Malmo, what does Deila do? Declare it another one-off and toss the DVD in the rubbish again?<br><br>Celtic are not learning and it&#39;s painful to watch. They&#39;re like a prize-fighter who lands some clean blows but who continually leaves his guard down and then wonders why the hell he&#39;s getting knocked out all the time. They do good things in matches, but the wretched things make their lives impossible.<br><br>Every team that plays this Celtic side knows about its soft underbelly and its propensity to lose the plot.<br><br>Light can turn to shade very quickly for them. One minute, they&#39;re bombing forward and creating things and the next the gaps they&#39;ve left in pursuit of a goal are plugged by the opposition. And then they&#39;re reeling. It&#39;s not quite Keystone Cops, but it&#39;s not far off.<br><br>Molde&#39;s first goal was a lovely strike by Elyounoussi, but he was given the ball by Blackett and the space by Blackett&#39;s team-mates. Their second - and the winner - was about defensive indecisiveness and then defensive absent-mindedness.<br><br>This keeps happening. In Europe, Celtic are going backwards.<br><br>The club&#39;s hierarchy have things to ponder. Deila is trying to rebuild the side.<br><br>Some of the Celtic decision-makers will be minded to give him time to get on with it and others will want to see more reason to give him that time. It&#39;s there domestically, but not internationally. <br><br> It was a dank night in the east end of Glasgow. A night that posed many questions.<br><br>There was one bright shaft and it was Kieran Tierney, a full-back who&#39;s backing up performances week on week.<br><br>He can defend, attack, play a pass and hit a cross. He&#39;s got pace and hunger.<br><br>Sure, he&#39;s a raw work-in-progress, but that&#39;s OK. He&#39;s 18-years-old and still he was Celtic&#39;s best player against Molde.<br><br>Deila singled him out afterwards. KT, he called him. &quot;A positive thing on a dark day.&quot; The only positive.<br><br>Celtic Park used to be a European fortress where even Cristiano Ronaldo&#39;s Manchester United, Lionel Messi&#39;s Barcelona and Kaka&#39;s AC Milan could not avoid defeat. The memories remain vivid, but, really, those days, and that relevance in Europe, are an eternity ago.<br><br>It was once a hub of excitement, but Celtic Park has become a faded fairground, a tired version of its former self.<br><br>Those great &#39;European nights&#39; we talked about? That kind of glamour has gone from the place. </div><br></div>
