Considered by many to be one of the best prospects to emerge from Celtic Park in recent years, the young central defender&rsquo;s progress was dogged by a succession of career threatening knee injuries.   <br><br></font><font color="#333333">Signed as a 15 year old on the same day as teammate Stephen McManus, John Kennedy made his first team debut against Motherwell on 5 April 2000 at the age of 16 years and 231 days - a record at the time. He would make a total of 5 first team appearances that season under caretaker manager Kenny Dalglish. </font><font color="#333333">The arrival of Martin O&rsquo;Neill as manager in the summer of 2000 saw Kennedy drop back into the reserves to learn his trade, with the defender making only a handful of first team appearances over the next 3 seasons, but things were to change.<br><br></font><font color="#333333">The 2003/2004 season saw the young defender&rsquo;s star rise, before falling to earth with a sickening crunch. While Kennedy had been a regular in first team squads for a number of years, the strapping centre half was thrust into first team action on a number of occasions towards the end of 2003, making his Champions League debut against Lyon and scoring his first goal for the club in the 3-2 win over Dundee at Celtic Park 3 days later. Kennedy seemed to grow in stature with every passing game and by March of 2004 the defender had turned in a number of near flawless performances. <br><br>The performance that sealed his cult status was a towering display against Barcelona in the Nou Camp. Celtic had been written off despite going to Barcelona with a 1-0 home lead. John Kennedy had the unenviable task of tackling a top European side with the main Celtic defender out (Bobo Balde) and a novice goalkeeper behind him (David Marshall). Together with David Marshall, they played out of their skins and won us a no score draw that sealed our place in the next round. He was simply immense! He was a hero and deserving of all the praise that came to him.<br><br>Then came a match against Rangers only three days later, and Kennedy was given a rousing reception by the Celtic away support as he was awarded a starting place in the side. We won 2-1 and it was onwards and upwards for John. He seemed destined to become a fixture of the Celtic first team for years to come, and Kennedy was rewarded with his first international cap for Scotland against Romania at Hampden on 31 March 2004. <br><br>An incredible seven days, being lauded playing European football away against a premier side, a victory at Ibrox and now playing his first match for Scotland. The run was to come to a shuddering halt.<br><br></font><font color="#333333">During the match v Romania, as Kennedy slid in to tackle Romanian player Ioan Viorel Ganea, the Romanian viciously stamped on Kennedy&rsquo;s left knee, causing severe damage to the defender&rsquo;s cruciate ligament. The foul was reckless, unnecessary and simply assault. It was painful for the support to see this as well, but most importantly was that many feared for his career even at this point. </font><font color="#333333">Sadly the Scotland game was to be the last first team game the defender would play for more than 3 years.</font><font color="#333333"> </font><br><font color="#333333"><br>All the support in the world was given by Celtic. Kennedy&rsquo;s knee was operated on several times by renowned American surgeon Dr Richard Steadman and on October 2005, after a period of intense rehabilitation, the defender resumed training with the first team squad. However Kennedy suffered a recurrence of the knee injury soon after and went under the knife again to undergo a &ldquo;tightening up&rdquo; procedure. The defender showed great mental strength to recover from this massive setback, and returned to training in late 2006. A number of reserve team appearance seemed to show that Kennedy had made a full recovery, and the 23 year old was named on the bench in several first team games including Celtic&rsquo;s Champions League match against AC Milan on the 20th of February 2007. <br><br>On 22nd of April 2007 an injury to Stephen McManus saw Kennedy make his return to first team action alongside Steven Pressley in what would turn out to be the league decider. Celtic ran out 2-1 winners on the day to clinch their second successive Premier League Title, with Kennedy turning in a confident display at the heart of the defence. He went on to make a further two appearances for the first team as the season wound down. The 2007/2008 season was again a mixture a highs and lows for Kennedy. The defender started the season opener alongside club captain Stephen McManus, as Celtic laboured to a 0-0 draw with Kilmarnock. Kennedy went on to make another 13 appearances for the first team that season, as he began to show glimpses of the player he was before his horrific injury. <br><br>However a miserable night against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League was to be defender&rsquo;s last appearance that season as injury struck again. Kennedy landed awkwardly after challenging for a high ball, damaging his lateral meniscus and the posterior lateral complex of his left knee. The injury ruled him out for the rest of the season. <br><br>In July 2008, after speculation he would be going to Motherwell on loan, Kennedy agreed to join Norwich City on a 6 month loan deal up to January 2009. After a fair spell (where he even managed to score a goal), disaster occurred once again </font>after further damaging his troubled knee in December 2008 which hastened a return to Celtic. <br><br>Celtic stood by Kennedy throughout but there was just so much that John Kennedy or anyone can really take. In November 2009, John Kennedy announced his premature retirement from senior football on medical grounds at 26. It should have been the prime of his career.<br><br>His playing career was over before it had really started. Too often players in similar situations have been praised beyond recognition, but in John Kennedy&#39;s case there is a genuine case to bemoan his circumstances. His performances in his short great spell in 2004 were exemplary, and it is no exaggeration to believe that he would have had a great chance to make a name for himself in time. <br><br>Sadly, an ugly piece of thuggery destroyed his football career and we can only imagine the devastation and hurt that he and his family have gone through.<br><br>The club rectified the situation and made him a valuable member of staff, and in January 2010 the club announced that John Kennedy would take on a role as first team scout, a move much welcomed and appreciated by all.<br><br>A wonderful testimonial was held in his honour in 2011:<br><a href="/page/2011-08-09%3A+Celtic+Legends+5-2+Manchester+Utd+Legends%2C+Friendly" target="_self">2011-08-09: Celtic Legends 5-2 Manchester Utd Legends, Friendly</a><br><br><div><b>Post-Playing Career</b><br>It was announced in August 2011 that John would take over from Steve Fraill in managing the U19s squad along with Tommy McIntyre see: &quot;giving Tommy McIntyre and John Kennedy&#39;s side a perfect start in their title defence.&quot;   <a class="external" href="http://www.celticfc.net/newsstory?item=1409" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.celticfc.net/newsstory?item=1409</a></div><div></div><div><br>In February 2019, he was announced to work as the assistant manager for the interim with Neil Lennon who had taken over as interim manager following the unexpected sudden departure of Brendan Rodgers. He answered well on why he chose to stay:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;There wasn&rsquo;t a moment when I might have gone too. I&rsquo;ve had a really  close attachment with Celtic. A lot of people say it and that kind of  stuff, but I&rsquo;ve spent a large chunk of my life here in terms of being a  player and working behind the scenes.&quot;

It turned out to be his one and only cap.<br><br>He was out of the first team at Celtic for over three years and underwent several operations before returning to action on 22 April, 2007, to help Celtic clinch the Clydesdale Bank Premier League title with a 2-1 victory at Kilmarnock.<br><br>Kennedy signed a new three-year contract four days later, but in November of the same year he was stretchered off during a Champions League clash against Shakhtar Donetsk at Celtic Park with further damage to the same knee.<br><br>It proved to be his last game for the club.<br><br>Kennedy began a loan spell at Norwich City last summer but returned to Glasgow at the end of the year after again damaging his knee and, ultimately, he was unable to come through another period of rehabilitation, leading to yesterday&#39;s decision.<br><br>&quot;It is with great regret that I have made this decision,&quot; said Kennedy. &quot;However, given the medical advice which I received, this is the right decision. <br><br>&quot;Clearly, this is very disappointing for me and my family. However, this is something I will accept and come to terms with.<br><br>&quot;I have enjoyed my time with Celtic immensely and I would like to thank everyone at the club and all the Celtic fans for all the support and backing they have given me during my time.<br><br>&quot;It has been an absolute privilege to play for such a great club and of course I wish the team the very best for the future.&quot;<br><br>Celtic manager Tony Mowbray, who has been unable to select the player since arriving from West Brom in the summer, described the news of Kennedy&#39;s retirement as &quot;tragic&quot;.<br><br>&quot;For John, his family and indeed everyone at the club, this is extremely sad news,&quot; he said. &quot;It really is tragic that John&#39;s career has been cut so short in this manner.

He had to come after me and say, &#39;no, you&#39;re actually training with the first team&#39;,&quot; Kennedy recalls.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Shock, nerves, a bit of butterflies... I went out, trained and found out after the session I was going to be in the squad for Motherwell the following night.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He was named on the bench for the 4-0 shellacking Celtic dished out. The game had entered its final 10 minutes when Dalglish gave him &quot;the shout&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It was pure excitement - just get me on. I remember the stadium, the feeling, the team winning 4-0,&quot; he says.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It was a strange few months going from an apprentice boot boy who occasionally plays with the youth team to stepping out on to Celtic Park which was a dream for a long time. It was a big achievement, but at that point, I was young and there were injuries and gaps in the first team to maybe give young ones an opportunity. I did everything I could to make an impression.&quot;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">John Kennedy and Neil Lennon celebrate a Celtic goal</span><br><span class="diffAdd">With John Kennedy as his assistant, Neil Lennon has won both matches since returning to Celtic as manager</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&#39;My shin popped out of position&#39;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Five years on, Kennedy was a regular at the heart of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s Celtic defence. He starred in a draw with Barcelona at the Nou Camp and an Old Firm derby triumph at Ibrox before being called up for his Scotland debut against Romania in March 2004.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Then, disaster struck. Kennedy was hammered late by a vicious Ioanel Ganea tackle. His leg was broken.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I remember on the pitch I thought I had broken my leg. I tried to stand up and my shin popped out of position,&quot; he says.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;When you are young, you just think you are untouchable. You know, playing in the Nou Camp and going to Ibrox, playing with Henrik Larsson and Chris Sutton, and you are just in your own wee bubble. Then all of a sudden someone brings the needle out and bursts that and reality sets in.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Kennedy went to America for assessment and surgery where he was told he would be out for 18 months. He would have to wait almost three years until his next Celtic appearance in April 2007.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Seven months later, he was crocked again, knee damage this time. Back to America. Back under the knife.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Once more, Kennedy returned to action, but he could feel his knee grumbling and his powers diminishing. Celtic were poised to recall him from a loan spell at Norwich City when his ankle then his knee, again, broke down. At just 26, the writing was on the wall.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;At that point I was struggling a little bit. I could feel towards the end of games I was in a bit of pain, quite stiff and couldn&#39;t move the way I wanted, but I just wanted to push as much as I could to give it another go,&quot; Kennedy says.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Ultimately it was never going to be. In the end the surgeon made the decision for me to call it a day. It was the right decision. I think when he told me it was time up, I felt a bit of relief. Physically, I was probably doing myself more harm than good.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;For someone to take the decision out of my hands and say, &#39;you need to stop now or your going to have long-term damage which will affect your normal daily life&#39;, then it was the right call. It gave me a bit of relief and I just had to focus on what I was going to do next.&quot;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&#39;Dream&#39; to manage Celtic</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Kennedy stayed at Celtic, working as a scout then earning his coaching badges, leading the under-19s and the reserve side before being promoted to first-team coach five years ago.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">With Rodgers&#39; departure to Leicester City, Kennedy was elevated again to assist Lennon.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He refutes rumours he was to be appointed the club&#39;s director of football and says he was not tempted to follow Rodgers south. His ultimate ambition is to manage the club he supports.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It&#39;s a dream. It&#39;s not something I&#39;m going to get caught up in and overrule what I do now in terms of trying to become the Celtic manager,&quot; he says.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Chris Davies, Brendan Rodgers and John Kennedy in the Celtic dug-out at Rugby Park</span><br><span class="diffAdd">A first-team coach since 2014, Kennedy spent two-and-a-half years under Brendan Rodgers</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I&#39;m in the moment, I know if I don&#39;t deliver as assistant manager, then things happen and you need to move on. You work at big clubs, there are those pressures.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I had a great relationship with Brendan, spoke to him about a number of things and what the future might hold, but ultimately I was there preparing the team. I&#39;m happy here, I don&#39;t want to be moving anywhere at the moment.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I&#39;m in a good place, the club are in a great moment and when you&#39;re in these moments you&#39;ve got to savour it because I&#39;ve seen the other side of it as a fan and even as a player when you&#39;re maybe not winning, you&#39;re chasing the opposition. At the moment we&#39;re on top of our game.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Listen to the full interview with Celtic assistant manager John Kennedy on BBC Radio Scotland&#39;s Sportsound from 14:00 GMT on Saturday. </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3></div><div></div></div>
