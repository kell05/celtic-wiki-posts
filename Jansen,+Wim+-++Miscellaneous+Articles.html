He insists McCann wouldn&#39;t have had the bottle to axe him.<br><br>Jansen revealed: &quot;I told McCann privately and he didn&#39;t try to hold on to me. He understood my feelings.<br><br>&quot;He  may have said he would have sacked me if I hadn&#39;t resigned but I&#39;m not  at all sure he meant it. Maybe it was the easiest thing for him to say  at the time.&quot;<br><br>Wim, that trademark perm still in place but a fair bit greyer, admits he misses the buzz of handling a top club.<br><br>And  although he hasn&#39;t worked since his traumatic spell in Glasgow it  hasn&#39;t been for the lack of offers. In fact, when we met at Feyenoord&#39;s  impressive stadium in Rotterdam, Jansen confided that he could soon be  back in full-time employment.<br><br>He said: &quot;I&#39;m staying involved by watching games from club to<br><br>international level and youth teams.<br><br>&quot;I  do miss being involved and felt it a couple of weeks ago after I had  finished a coaching session with Japanese kids. That gave me a feel for  it again. I am missing the competition and the excitement.<br><br>&quot;I have turned down jobs since I left Celtic because they were not right for me.<br><br>&quot;I do believe the right job will come along and I will take it, go there and start again.<br><br>&quot; I know exactly what I want but I can&#39;t explain to anyone what it is.&quot;<br><br>Wim swears he has no regrets after walking out on Celts.<br><br>After years at the top as a player and manager he has learned to trust his own judgment.<br><br>And  he recounts a crazy story about his best pal Wim van Hanegem to explain  how easy it can be in football to get snarled up in the decision making  process!<br><br>He said: &quot;It was a boiling hot afternoon 26 years ago  and my wife Coby and I were enjoying a picnic on a Zeeland island beach  with Wim and his girlfriend Truus.<br><br>&quot;Wim was considering an offer  to join Marseille from his beloved Feyenoord. He was in line to treble  his salary but couldn&#39;t make a decision on his own.<br><br>&quot;After a full afternoon going through the pros and cons with us he decided to put it to a vote.<br><br>&quot;When  the result was two for and two against, Wim gave the casting show of a  paw to his pet dog. `If you want to go to Marseille bark, or show me,&#39;  he told the dog.<br><br>&quot;They stared at each other for several minutes, the dog stood still and didn&#39;t make a sound.<br><br>&quot; `Fine,&#39; said Wim, `he doesn&#39;t want to go. We&#39;re staying.&#39; And he did just that!&quot;<br><br>Jansen  faced a similarly tough decision - but without any help from man&#39;s best  friend - towards the end of season 1997-78 when he was in charge of  Celtic.<br><br>He loved the club, loved his coaching staff of Murdo  MacLeod and Danny McGrain and the players he had brought in such as  Henrik Larsson, Paul Lambert and Marc Rieper.<br><br>The Hoops were  marching towards the SPL title to halt Rangers&#39; 10-in- a-row bid and  Jansen knew a crack at the Champions League would follow.<br><br>But he had no form of working relationship with his immediate boss Jock Brown or McCann.<br><br>Wim said: &quot;When Celtic offered me the job I knew within one second it was right for me.<br><br>&quot;The  club reminded me of Feyenoord with its history - we were the first  Dutch team to win the European Cup like Celtic in Britain and also had  great supporters.<br><br>&quot;I thought I could do well with them and it  will be the same again for my next job. That is the normal way to feel.  Of course, it didn&#39;t end the way I wanted in terms of leaving Celtic. It  was a hard decision to make because I wanted to see it right through  with the team we were building but it was growing on me to leave,  especially after David Hay was away.<br><br>&quot;I did not feel I had 100 per cent backing from those in charge and we would not talk to each other during the week.<br><br>&quot;They  wouldn&#39;t spend the money and I didn&#39;t want to fight with them anymore.  That is the last thing a coach needs when he is trying to get success.<br><br>&quot;The  people who are now in charge of Celtic understand what it is all about  and know what they have to do to help the coach turn them in to a top  European team.<br><br>&quot;If they had been in charge when I was there I  wouldn&#39;t have left. Could I end back at Celtic some day? Well, you never  say `no&#39; in soccer.<br><br>&quot;But I made up my mind by myself to go. I  thought it was the right thing to do to help the club start early to  find my successor. At the end McCann made the best of it all and left  with a lot of money.&quot;<br><br>Fergus walked away from Parkhead with around pounds 40million after his five- year stint as head honcho at Celtic Park.<br><br>Jansen  spent less than pounds 5m during his year and would have loved more  cash to improve the team and help bring in the quality he knew he could  attract to the East End of Glasgow such as Pierre van Hooijdonk, Nwanko  Kanu and Keiron Dyer.<br><br>But the McCann piggy bank remained closed  and Jansen sighed: &quot;I wanted to bring Pierre back because I knew he  would be perfect with Henrik.<br><br>&quot;He wanted to return but Celtic wouldn&#39;t spend the money.<br><br>&quot;I also wanted to keep Paolo di Canio. Could you imagine the team with those three?<br><br>&quot;It  would have been easier for me if I had been allowed to bring in the  players I wanted but at least I had a strong and faithful coaching staff  beside me.<br><br>&quot;We all got on well and knew what we wanted to do for  the team. We were also close to the players and I know we would all  have done anything for each other.&quot;<br><br>Jansen and Paul Lambert  formed a particularly close relationship and would often spend the day  after a game going over a few things and preparing for the next match.<br><br>As  the other players relaxed on a day off, the Scotland star would be in  doing some light exercises and receiving instructions from the Dutchman  for the next game as they spoke in the home dressing-room.<br><br>Jansen had absolute faith in his midfield star and said: &quot;Paul is a very intelligent footballer. He was my coach on the pitch.<br><br>&quot;For  example, when we were alone together and getting ready for an Old Firm  game I would tell Paul what I wanted him to do on the pitch if certain  situations arose. I had to do that because<br><br>it was impossible to shout out instructions with all that incredible noise at a Celtic-Rangers match.<br><br>&quot;So Paul would know when to move this guy or that guy into a different position depending on how the game was going.<br><br>&quot;He is a fantastic pro and I&#39;ve no doubts he can go all the way in coaching and take charge of a big club.&quot;<br><br>Lambert has had the good fortune to play under some of the best during his career, such as Jansen and Ottmar Hitzfeld.<br><br>Wim also had that as a player with the legendary Ernst Happel and equally brilliant Rinus Michels.<br><br>Happel,  an Austrian, led Feyenoord to the European Cup Final triumph over  Celtic in 1970 and later took the Dutch national team to the final of  the 1978 World Cup when they were beaten 3-1 by Argentina.<br><br>Jansen played in that one and in the Final four years earlier when they lost by the same score to West Germany.<br><br>He  said: &quot;I have enjoyed my whole career but what sticks out are winning  the European Cup against Celtic and lifting the league with Celtic.&quot;<br><br>There  was almost a tragic end to Jansen&#39;s playing career. He nearly lost his  right eye when an irate Feyenoord fan hit him full on with a snowball  during the warm-up before a game against Ajax, whom Wim had joined after  leaving the Rotterdam club.<br><br>Only an operation saved his sight.<br><br>But  the wounds have healed and the way Jansen was treated by the Feyenoord  supporters during our interview was incredible. Hardly a moment passed  without someone coming over for a chat about yesteryear.<br><br>Feyenoord  is his spiritual home and always will be. He looked at ease inside the  stadium, using his influence to have the security guard open the door  and allow us out beside the pitch. All this makes you wonder if the  Feyenoord post is the job he is waiting for.<br><br>If it does come up, and something must because this guy is too good for the game to lose forever, he will be well prepared.<br><br>Wim  has spent the last three years building up his own personal soccer  manual, which he has been working on for the past 15 years and which is  now more than 10 inches thick.<br><br>He said: &quot;I&#39;ve been lucky to work  under some talented coaches throughout my career. Happel was incredible  and kept everything simple.<br><br>&quot;During our 1970 European Cup run we  had to play AC Milan at a time when Italian football was the tops. They  had the brilliant playmaker Rivera and we knew if he was stopped his  team would not function.<br><br>&quot;Everyone assumed van Hanegem would  man-mark him but the day before the game Happel strolled past me and  said one word `Rivera&#39;. He didn&#39;t have to say any more.<br><br>&quot;I knew  what my task was and Rivera didn&#39;t get a kick at the ball in the two  games. We lost the first leg 1-0 over there but won the return 2-0. I  scored the first and van Hanegem the second.<br><br>&quot;It is stuff like  that from Happel I remember and have used in my own coaching career. I  have never liked to make things complicated.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s why in my  own little coaching manual - my soccer dictionary - all my notes are  almost in one line. It is all about different things such as tactics,  skills - mental and physical issues.<br><br>&quot;I have also written things  down about positional play because only one guy can have the ball, which  leaves 21 others without it. That means it is just as important for the  others to make the right runs to help the guy with the ball.<br><br>&quot;My little book will be handy for my next job. But so will the foundations of the club.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s  important to have a good scout and a good youth coach. If the wrong guy  is practising with the kids then he could spend 100 hours with them and  they will learn absolutely nothing.<br><br>&quot;The right coach could teach  them things in just one hour. Things like positional play. I know some  people think you shouldn&#39;t confuse kids with that at an early age but if  they are good enough they will pick up on the points and use them to  their advantage.<br><br>&quot;Look at Johan Cruyff, he knew about all of that by the time he was 10.<br><br>&quot;A good youth coach might cost about pounds 200,000 a year but is worth it for that alone.<br><br>&quot;A  good scout might cost the same but if he works for 10 years and can  find you the next Henrik Larsson - or just one good player every two  years - then he could bring in maybe pounds 40m or pounds 50m in  transfer fees against his salary of pounds 2m. Surely, that makes sense?<br><br>&quot;But I have been involved in football long enough to know not everyone&#39;s mind works that way,&quot; Jansen said.<br><br>And it certainly doesn&#39;t need four adults and a dog to know that.<br><br>COPYRIGHT 2001 Scottish Daily Record &amp; Sunday<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>  </h3><h3> Wim was not fourth choice; BROWN BACKS JANSEN.    </h3>    COPYRIGHT 1997 Scottish Daily Record &amp; Sunday<br><br>Jock Brownlast night furiously denied claims that Wim Jansenwas fourth choice for the Celtic job.  <br><br>   The Parkhead general manager hit out after Dutch agent Bob Maskaant  alleged he was asked by Fergus McCannto offer the head coach position to  Louis van Gaal, Guus Hiddinkand Dick Advocaat.  <br><br>  Brown said: &quot;Any story suggesting that Wim Jansen was the fourth choice Dutch coach for the Celtic job is totally untrue.  <br><br>   &quot;Guus Hiddink, Dick Advocaat and Louis van Gaal were certainly not  offered the Celtic job and none of them were ever spoken to by anyone at  Celtic.  <br><br>  &quot;It is only professional and sensible for a club  such as Celtic to obtain all relevant information on the credentials and  availability of all potential candidates.  <br><br>  &quot;Celtic did just that before offering the post to Wim Jansen.  <br><br>  &quot;Bob Maskaant acted for us as one of several research consultants.  <br><br>   &quot;I have asked him to clarify his position and he states `I was  consulted by Celtic and supplied them with information on potential  candidates. To my knowledge only one person was interviewed and offered  the job - Wim Jansen&#39;.&quot;  <br><br>  Maskaant&#39;s claims rocked the Dutch press.  <br><br>  He even alleged that Holland boss Hiddink knocked back McCann three times.  <br><br>  Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsbladquoted Maskaant as saying: &quot;McCann called me to try and arrange a manager.  <br><br>   &quot;He asked me to contact them to find out if any of them would be  interested in managing Celtic. But all of these coaches simply didn&#39;t  want to know.  <br><br>  &quot;McCann came back and I had to ask Hiddink THREE times whether he would take the Celtic job.  <br><br>  &quot;But he said he wasn&#39;t interested in managing anyone apart from the national side.  <br><br>  &quot;I then suggested the name of Wim Jansen.&quot;  <br><br>  Andreas Thom, meanwhile, could be the next expensive import to be shown the door at Parkhead.  <br><br>  Crisis-hit Werder Bremen want to take the 31-year-old home in a pounds 1 million deal.  <br><br>  Celtic could be keen to do business as they try to raise funds to finance more signings.  <br><br>   Jansen axed Thom from his starting line-up on Tuesday at St Johnstone  and that coincided with a move by Bremen president Dr Franz Boehmert.  <br><br>   He may press ahead with a bid despite firing boss Dixie Doerner  earlier this week after Bremen were stuffed 8-0 in a friendly with  Atletico Madrid.  <br><br>  A move for Thom could help ease through a Celtsswoop for Hamburg keeper Richard Golz.  <br><br>  Celtic have offered around pounds 330,000 for him but the Germans want pounds 900,000.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Jansen quits Celtic</h3>BBC 11 May 1998<font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br><br>     	</font><div class="bodytext"><font face="sans-serif" size="2">Wim Jansen, who led Celtic to their first Scottish championship in 10 years, is to quit Parkhead.<br><br> Jansen exercised a get-out clause in his contract less than 48 hours  after the title was secured with a 2-0 home win over St Johnstone. <br><br>   Jansen was a relative unknown when he arrived in Glasgow last summer as a replacement for the sacked Tommy Burns. <br><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2">   		 			</font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> 		    But he has had huge success in his first season in Scotland, winning the  Coca-Cola Cup in November before finally prising the championship away  from Rangers&#39;

he said. <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;I have no doubt this will continue next season as the club moves onwards and upwards. <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;Many people said it was wrong to appoint a new coach this time last  year and there were headlines screaming criticism at the appointment of  Wim Jansen.</font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br> </font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;But despite all the noise, Celtic has kept its eye on the ball, the  League and League Cup have been won, a 60,000-seat stadium will have  50,000 season ticket holders and the scene is set for the next exciting  stage in Celtic&#39;s history. <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;All of this was not the result of the efforts of one season, or of one  man,&quot; added McCann. &quot;I want to pay tribute to all those at the club,  especially the players, all of whom have worked so hard for success,  some for four years or more.&quot; <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;Individuals will always come and go but the legend that is Celtic continues.&quot; <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> McCann insists that Jansen had originally only wanted a one-year deal  but had agreed to the longer deal with both sides having the option of  terminating the contract after 12 months. <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;The club agreed a three-year term, with the option for both sides to terminate the contract after one year,&quot; said McCann. <br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"><br></font><font face="sans-serif" size="2"> &quot;This was one of the key elements of the agreement, as well as a commitment to maintain its content confidential.&quot;
