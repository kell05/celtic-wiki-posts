Relaxed and light  hearted,   he has the great knack of being able to tell an old story in an  easy   pleasant way. With the aura and look of an adorable old uncle,  you can&#39;t   help but like him on a personal level. <br><br>Having been  reared in  the  traditions of the club since birth he had the  interesting position  of  shadowing Celtic chairman Bob Kelly prior to the Jock  Stein years to learn how a   chairman was to work in times of adversity  before getting a prime seat   watching Celtic through nine in a row.  This bred in him a love   for the club that can never be  faulted and he has the most amazing   knack of being able to recall  matches long forgotten by the rest of us   as if they&#39;d happened only  yesterday. This has helped him become a   regular figure in history  DVDs and documentaries on the club which he   handles very well.<br><br>With  a background like that and a strong   reputation as an an honourable gentleman and avid Celtic supporter, it  would appear that he was a fair choice to be our   chairman. That was the big  mistake and one everyone was to regret.<br><br>For   all his old Celtic  charms, Kevin Kelly really was just a doddering old   fool as the club chairman. His sole qualification rested alone on the   limited  family ownership of the club at the time and its reactionary   attitude  to any outside involvement. With minimal experience in high end    finance and business, he was a poor choice to lead a club like Celtic at a time of major transition in football.  <br><br>The    football world was changing rapidly during his reign with big money   and  business becoming increasingly involved, yet Celtic were lumbered with a    man too outdated to even be thought of as a business dinosaur. He   loved  to regale people with old tales of how Bob Kelly used to   stand up at  supporters&#39; meeting to show how big a Celtic man he was to   all, and  that he himself was in the same mould. As if that was some   sort of  education, Bob Kelly himself was saved mostly by Jock Stein&#39;s   success,  and any Celtic fan can tell you that there is no way Kevin   Kelly would  last long in a function full of irate blue-collar Celtic fans.<br><br>Under   his stewardship  the club moved to near bankruptcy, and his dithering in   making rational  decisions saw him irk just about everyone. Along with   his fellow  directors he allowed the club to spiral downwards, pushing Celtic perilously  close to administration.<br><br>During the <a href="/page/Celtic+Takeover" target="_self">Celtic Takeover</a>    debacle he skipped sides depending on whatever way the wind blew   before  finally signing up to a shareholder pact with fellow directors   which  almost brought down the club. Seemed to be too easily led despite    supposedly being the man in charge. It was hopeless.<br><br>He was also a major public relations blunderer, the following being just a selection from his tenure:<br><br><blockquote><b>The Cold Kale Episode: </b><br>On    some occasions Kevin Kelly seemed to be stuck in some Scottish time-warp  that would have baffled even &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;. For example, on one   set of  comments and criticisms by &quot;The Rebels&quot;, he strangely  criticised  them  for &quot;reheating this cold Kale&quot;. A bizarre metaphor, and  it didn&#39;t  help  the club&#39;s image on being portrayed as a modernising board. It made  him look  peculiar  and outdated.<br><br><b>Sport in Question:</b><br>On  Monday  late nights  in the early 1990s, football commentator Archie  MacPherson   used to do a  great panel sporting program called &quot;Sport in  Question&quot;   (before the other ITV companies copied and ruined the format), and one  program was   devoted to the  Celtic shambles with Celtic board members <a href="/page/Michael+Kelly" target="_self">Michael Kelly</a> and <a href="/page/Kevin+Kelly" target="_self">Kevin  Kelly</a>    on the show. It was a losing battle for the  Kellys as actions speak    louder than words, but anything that Michael  Kelly could have done to    alleviate the tensions were totally undone when <a href="/page/Kevin+Kelly" target="_self">Kevin  Kelly</a>    laughably stated on the show that &ldquo;nobody has Celtic&rsquo;s  interest at    heart&quot; more than he himself does etc and it made us all cringe. It was incredibly    insulting as when was the last time that Kevin Kelly had to save up  for a   match ticket or even just wait in a long queue for one having taken  time off   paid work to get it? No denying his love for the club but the comment was misplaced and mistimed.<br><br><b>The new Stadium at Cambuslang announcement:</b><br>In    an interview with BBC Sportscene on questioning over timing on the    proposed new stadium, Kevin Kelly stated that an announcement was close    and possibly within a week. The papers took a mile with this and after  a   week there was nothing; Kevin Kelly was made to look stupid even   though  he never said it would be definitely within a week. He&#39;d put   himself  and his colleagues in an awkward position by giving the press the opportunity. <br><br><b>Scottish Super League decision</b> (<a href="/page/Controversies+-+Scottish+Super+League+%28League+Reconstuction%29" target="_self">link</a>):<br>A    proposal to create the Scottish Premier League had precedents. One of    the first attempts saw most clubs agree on a format/structure, but  then   to the surprise of all the front page of the Celtic View had a  huge   headline of &quot;I hope the Super League never happens&quot;. In case anyone was wondering who said those words, there  was a   big picture of Kevin Kelly beside it. Much backtracking by Kevin  Kelly   to his club counterparts saw him back on board for the new  set-up,   proclaiming that really he was fully on board. Next thing,  Celtic voted   against it and said that they were actually against the  proposals all   along. Regardless of the board&#39;s stance, publicly it was a  shambles. Granted the   press saw an inch and took a mile (again), but  Kevin Kelly didn&#39;t half   give them the opportunity to do so. <br></blockquote><br>From  the above, he&#39;d  managed  to seriously irk and ruin relationships with  the other senior  Scottish  clubs, the Celtic support, the &#39;<i>Rebels</i>&#39;, the media, any  potential  club/stadium  financiers and his own board colleagues. What a  man! Unsurprisingly, his incompetence made him  easy to satirise as both the main Celtic  fanzines (&quot;Not  the View&quot; and  &quot;Once a Tim&quot;) did mercilessly. <br><br>His distance from the genuine feeling of the support was reflected again in his comment that &quot;<i>most decent Celtic fans will be embarrassed by what Celts for Change are doing</i>&quot;. He was wrong then with that opinion, and again further exacerbated a difficult situation.<br><br>At  the denouement of the Celtic Takeover, he was  to be an  inconsequential figure (quite a feat for the chairman of the club) and there have been  apologists claiming that  his  stance on selling out to the Rebels  deserves credit. Reality is  that it came practically as the club was  going into administration and he should have  done this  years earlier. He only stuck  his neck out once the club was financially dead and there were no  alternatives left. He was party to  the last gasp  desperate share offer  proposal that failed in the final  days. If he&#39;d  stuck his ground in the early days with  the Rebels and James Farrell, then  none of the  troubles would have  happened. It was tragic and comical.<br><br>It&#39;s   disappointing to see  that such a man who genuinely has the club at   heart be such a  failure, but a &quot;love for the club&quot; should not be the sole   qualification for a role  at the club. <a href="/page/Fergus+McCann" target="_self">Fergus McCann</a>    was to be a success as he was able to divorce business and leisure   (even  when it irked others). Kevin Kelly just wasn&#39;t equipped for the   role  and his tenure was possibly the most arduous the club has had to   ever  endure. <br><br>Post-takeover he&#39;d managed to carve out for himself an honorary  title on the board, but it was likely relief from the other   board  members once he&#39;d left. It certainly was for the supporters. <br><br>His ineptitude cannot be simply ignored and at least his cousin <a href="/page/Michael+Kelly" target="_self">Michael Kelly</a>    can be argued to have been making some attempt to move the club   forward  (whether you agreed with his plans or not). Kevin Kelly was   simply full  of blind fantasy, and that was the most dangerous part of   it all. It&#39;s a  lesson that has to be learnt and any similar experiments   must never be  repeated.<br><br>On the resignation of manager Liam   Brady (something  that should have happened long before it did), Kevin   Kelly said that  he&#39;d done the honourable thing. The irony of the words   weren&#39;t lost on  anyone and we only wish he and his cronies had simply   done the same thing so  much sooner than they finally did.  <br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Kevin Kelly" height="191" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/MA8yFzBP0nhfXLRxMnSOGg68580/GW493H191" title="Kevin Kelly" width="493"><div><b><br><br>Post-Note:</b></div><div>Sadly, his judgement was further tainted years later when revelations were revealed that he had entered business relations with Jim Torbett who later was found guilty of child abuse against young boys in the Celtic Boys Club. This does not mean that Kevin Kelly was aware in whole or in part of any of the wrong doings. Jim Torbett had once been released from Celtic Boys Club but later returned a number of years later. Kevin Kelly &amp; Jim Torbett were both involved in the Trophy Centre shops in Glasgow.<br><br>The question is what did Kevin Kelly know or not on the events surrounding Jim Torbett? Was he able to help those affected, or did the poor management at Celtic provide the environment to allow Jim Torbett to proceed with his actions? One statement in court (by Hugh Birtt) claimed that he had tried to inform Kevin Kelly (and other board members) of concerns over Jim Torbett and that Kevin Kelly will have (allegedly) known about the concerns on Jim Torbett. Kevin Kelly strongly denied being aware of allegations concerning Torbett when he returned to the Boys Club, and told the BBC that he was not aware of any previous allegations against Torbett until his court case in the 1990s.<br><br>In fairness, Jim Torbett and his ilk have a knack to pull the wool over the eyes of everyone and that is what happened at Celtic, as the victims were too young to come forward (it takes a lot of bravery &amp; understanding) and it was a different time. These cases have occurred across a number of football clubs in the UK (including Hibs &amp; Rangers). <br><br>It may not be fair to taint Kevin Kelly with what occurred, but on top of all his mishandling whilst at Celtic, this in addition to all else sadly doesn&#39;t help his case. Kevin Kelly is a good decent man from all the reports we have on him from people, and from the information we have to date, we do not believe he would have been party to anything that occurred but answers must be given where possible for the benefit of the victims and their families. </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Celtic+Takeover" target="_self">Celtic Takeover Homepage</a></li><li><a href="/page/Controversies+-+Scottish+Super+League+%28League+Reconstuction%29" target="_self">Controversies - Scottish Super League (League Reconstuction)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_1_JrYl1Iw&feature=youtu.be" target="_self">Youtube: Sport in Question with Kevin Kelly &amp; Michael Kelly (1993/94)</a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Quotes</h3>&quot;Most decent Celtic fans will be embarrassed by what Celts for Change are doing.&quot;<b><br>Chairman Kevin Kelly clearly shows how distant he was from reality and the general Celtic support(1994)</b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><img align="bottom" alt="Kelly in The View SSL" height="1441" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/AggWBcKJTFJNskx2uPPf-A1440540/GW883H1441" title="Kelly in The View SSL" width="883"><br></h3><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Kevin Kelly - The Celtic Wiki" height="328" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/6e919cab17846f091c45e4f2b7df4b5e/GW583H328" title="Kevin Kelly - The Celtic Wiki" width="583"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Kevin Kelly - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/23c4826fba858571b121c0bcfe99666f" title="Kevin Kelly - The Celtic Wiki"><br></div>
