Paul doesn&#39;t hide.&quot;<br><b>Martin O&#39;Neill on Paul Lambert (2003) </b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><img align="right" alt="Lambert, Paul - Pic" height="353" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/tI6xaz8C4Uk39qnyaWX_jA24830/GW236H353" title="Lambert, Paul - Pic" width="236"></h3>Paul Lambert&#39;s career started at St Mirren where he amassed 227 appearances for the club and had a Scottish Cup winners medal tucked under his belt before he left for three seasons at Motherwell.  <br><br>If rumours are to be believed, Lambert and Motherwell parted company over the trifling matter of a request for an additional &pound;50 in his weekly wage packet. One wonders how Fir Park aficionados must have felt as they watched a triumphant Lambert lift the European Cup with Borussia Dortmund only 10 months later, a triumph in which he played an important part and was lauded by his fellow team mates and by the management also. <br><br>He nullified the great Zinedine Zidane in the final against Juventus, also creating an assist for the first of Karl-Heinz Riedle&rsquo;s two goals. He became the first British player to pick up a European Cup winners medal since its reincarnation as the Champions League. He was also the first British player to win the European Cup with a team outwith of Britain.<br><br>A combative midfielder, no one would have predicted that Lambert would go from being a Motherwell player in 1996 to a European Cup champion in 1997, in one of British football&#39;s most unlikely fairytales.<br><br>Although there is no doubt that Lambert was worth that extra &pound;50, he returned from Germany to Scotland after 15 months at the Westfalen as a completely different player and was suddenly a mainstay in the national side. He moved to Celtic to the surprise of some as he had supposedly grown up as a Rangers fan. <br><br>How did it go? The following eight seasons with Celtic saw Lambert achieve four league winners medals, 2 Scottish Cups, 2 League Cups, a Football Writers&#39; Player of the Year Award (2002) and another appearance in a European final. He was quite simply a magnificent professional who gave his all every week for Celtic. <br><br>He played a crucial role in the wonderful 1997-98 season that saw Celtic stop Rangers &quot;Ten-in-a-row&quot; bid, and his joy as Celtic beat Rangers in the crucial New Years game was there for all to see, especially as he scored the spectacular second that sealed the win and turned the season around for Celtic. That game was pivotal and he more then played the part.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t all plain sailing though with injury curtailing his time during the gloomy one season under Barnes/Dalglish (a blessing in disguise for him possibly). The lowest point, came in one match against Rangers, his cheekbone was smashed and teeth knocked by Jorg Albertz in a tackle (must add it was NOT a malicious attack by Albertz). A sorry situation, and without using any common sense or tact, the Rangers manager (the aptly named Dick Advocaat) raged that Lambert was at fault and should have been red carded for it. Pathetic, and Celtic lost a penalty on the back of it. Unbelievable. Likely enough to shake out any remnants of sympathy for Rangers from Lambert if ever any remained.<br><br>He recovered, and under new Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill, Lambert experienced a golden period in his career for Celtic, and he was a fundamental part of the whole success. The treble in 2000-01 was special and in some way revenge over Dick Advocaat after his disgraceful comments in the previous season. Onwards from there were successive league victories and then the pinnacle with Celtic as Celtic reached the UEFA Cup final in 2003 and lost. <br><br>Lambert was pivotal in the success and a major boon for Martin O&#39;Neil. A great leader who led by example on the pitch, he helped to shore up the side and give us the added edge over opponents. Experience in Germany meant he was well taught, and we heavily benefited from his presence. Fair to say that he was one of the finest midfield players we&#39;d had over the past twenty years.<br><br>However it was also as a person that he was respected, and perhaps the greatest testimony to the man comes not from these achievements but from the fans of the clubs for whom he was such a consistent performer. The Dortmund support stayed behind after his last game in Germany to show their appreciation with countless banners and messages of gratitude and he is very fondly remembered down Love Street way for his part in their halcyon days of the late eighties.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><img align="right" alt="1997-98 pics - Kerrydale Street" height="279" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/-tl76M2qRiz434n7qT_p1g89856/GW200H279" title="1997-98 pics - Kerrydale Street" width="200"><br>Lambert stepped into management, but resigned as Livingston player-manager in his first stint, but gives further insight into the man and his character. In a move that was as humble as it was brave, he resigned as manager in the hope that someone else would be able to save the club from relegation, inflicting potentially irreparable damage to his fledgling managerial career. This despite assurances from the board that his job was safe and amid widespread belief that his was an impossible task. His modesty, however, told him that there may be something that another individual could bring to the club to save it from relegation. <br><br>Lambert recovered from this blow to his managerial career when he was named as the Wycombe Wanderers manager in June 2006. He left Wycombe at the end of the 2007-08 season. He was then appointed manager of English League Division 1 side Colchester Utd on the 9th October 2008. Within a year he was continuing on his upward trajectory and took the reins at Norwich City. After guiding the canaries to promotion in his first season, he was rumoured to be linked with the Celtic job when Mowbray was sacked. <br><br>Lambert - who at one point was reluctant to work in the goldfish bowl environment of Scotland again - remained at the Canaries as his former midfield partner Neil Lennon was awarded the Parkhead job. He guided the Norfolk club to the Premiership at the first time of asking and cemented his place as a legend among the Carrow Road faithful. Facing life in the English top flight was to be a tough challenge at Norwich, a well supported and genuine community club but one with a modest budget compared to many of their foreign owned rivals. However he succeeded and his name was repeatedly linked with the top jobs in England. He left Norwich for Aston Villa in 2012, but that stint was unsuccessful and he was unceremoniously sacked in 2015.<br><br>[....]<br><br>We wish him all the best, a great player we have had the privilege to see have played with Celtic.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Quotes<br></h3>&ldquo;I think everybody wants to play in the Premiership and Grant Holt is no different. To be honest, the Rangers bid was nowhere near our valuation. But I told Grant what was going on and he gave absolutely no indication that he wanted to go and talk to them. If he had, it might have been different. A move to Rangers might have been attractive to a lot of players, but they are not as strong as they used to be. Holt has waited a long time to get to the Premier League and it&rsquo;s great for him to be playing here, considering where he has come from. So while it was a flattering offer for him, I never expected him to want to leave.

Lambert&rsquo;s greatest moment in career full of highlights</h3>Hugh MacDonald Published on 2 Jan 2010  <br><br>The Herald Newspaper<br><br>It is a career that should belong only in the fevered imagination of a schoolboy. A Scottish Cup winner&rsquo;s medal at the age of 17 was followed by negating Zinedine Zidane in a Champions League final and laying on a goal for Karl-Heinz Riedle. <br><br>His return to Scotland was festooned with four league titles, three Scottish Cup wins and four league cups. He also captained Celtic to a UEFA Cup final. This is a career with so many highlights it could double for Mo Johnston&rsquo;s hair. Yet Paul Lambert has no doubt about his greatest achievement. &ldquo;It has to be stopping 10-in-a-row,&rdquo; he said. The statement was made when the midfielder was inducted tothe Scottish Football Hall of Fame in November. His judgment of the campaign of 1997-1998 owes nothing to any narrow bias. Lambert, a product of Linwood Rangers Boys&rsquo; Club, was merely reflecting on a period when winning was not only accompanied by jubilation but was liberally laced with relief. <br><br>&ldquo;The pressure was hugely intense,&rdquo; he recalls of the season when Walter Smith&rsquo;s side were thwarted by a resurgent Celtic under Wim Jansen. <br><br>&ldquo;That is what made winning the league very special. Everybody was talking about 10-in-a-row. We all knew that we could not be the Celtic team that allowed Rangers to win 10 consecutive titles. That would have been etched in Celtic&rsquo;s history. Out of all the cups and all the leagues, that title win is simply very special. &ldquo;I do not say that to annoy Rangers fans, I just say it because I have never felt so relieved in football as I did when that championship was won.&rdquo;<br><br>Lambert, of course, won the Scottish Cup with St Mirren in 1987, lifted the Champions League trophy with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, and went on to win four titles with Celtic. <br><br>&ldquo;It is hard to categorise every accolade you have won,&rdquo; he said. <br><br>&ldquo;Getting into the Hall of Fame is great. It is fantastic to be recognised by your own country. To be part of the history of our national game is simply humbling. And it will always be there, which is an incredible honour when you see the people in it. <br><br>&ldquo;The Champions League is the pinnacle of anyone&rsquo;s career, but stopping Rangers winning the title was certainly up there because of the pressure and that is why I mentioned it at the Hall of Fame dinner. The supporters of both clubs were desperate in that season so imagine how the players felt.&rdquo; <br><br>Lambert, a highly technical player with virtues that sometimes went unnoticed, eschewed the spectacular for much of his career. He was more concerned with being an important part of a team rather than a maverick who stole thunder at the expense of the efficiency of the unit. Yet he scored goals in two of the most important Old Firm matches in recent history.<br><br>His magnificent strike on January 2 1998 galvanised Celtic&rsquo;s battle for the title. He slotted home the third goal in the 6-2 defeat of Rangers on August 27, 2000, which signalled that Martin O&rsquo;Neill had immediately constructed a side capable of snatching a title from Dick Advocaat&rsquo;s team. The New Year strike was Lambert&rsquo;s first goal for Celtic. &ldquo;We had to win that New Year game,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;There was no room for error because of the points difference.&rdquo; Celtic were already four points behind Rangers and knew the gap had to be narrowed. Craig Burley&rsquo;s slick finish was complemented by Lambert&rsquo;s shot from 30 yards. &ldquo;I still get reminded of the one I whacked in the top corner,&rdquo; said Lambert.<br><br>&ldquo;It was one of those ones that you see coming at you and you decide just to have a go. The bounce was right, it felt right to hit it and it went right into the top corner.&rdquo; The goal in the 6-2 game suffers in comparison with the extraordinary lob conjured up by Henrik Larsson as O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s team laid down a marker for the season. <br><br>There was much pre-match talk about O&rsquo;Neill being content to take time in constructing a side capable of winning a title. His team knew this modest ambition was strictly for the consumption of the press. Every player was left in no doubt before the match that O&rsquo;Neill expected victory and a championship by the end of the season. &ldquo;The big thing about that match was that we knocked out Ajax in a Champions League qualifier that gave us great confidence,&rdquo; he said. <br><br>The victory over Rangers was the satisfying appetiser to a treble-winning season. &ldquo;I guarantee you a lot of people at Celtic would love to see that team back again,&rdquo; said Lambert of a side built on solid virtues. The Champions League-winning midfielder was surrounded by Larsson, Chris Sutton, Stilian Petrov, Neil Lennon, Johan Mjallby and others who had skill overlaid with a winning mentality. <br><br>&ldquo;I was talking to Bobby Lennox and he told me that he didn&rsquo;t realise just how good that team was until it was disbanded. That was a massive compliment,&rdquo; said Lambert. &ldquo;That was a team of men. Anybody looking at the team could see there were brilliant players. But they were proper men, they would not wilt, they would stick together. Everybody says we were strong physically, and we were, but we could play the game. That is how and why we won things.&rdquo; But how is triumph grasped from the frenetic atmosphere of an Old Firm match? <br><br>&ldquo;The occasion is great but it should not be overwhelming. First and foremost, you have to play the occasion. You do not want to get caught up in that incredible atmosphere and get sent off . You have to keep 11 on the park to have a great chance of winning the game. And you need a bit of luck.&rdquo; <br><br>Lambert also acknowledged that the testing experience can pay dividends in later life. Now managing successfully at Norwich City, he said: &ldquo;We have pressure at this club. We have 25,000 fans at every match at Carrow Road and they quite rightly have expectations.&rdquo; <br><br>Lambert, who has managed at Livingston, Wycombe, and Colchester, is meeting those expectations as Norwich sit in third place in League One. He is enjoying the pressure of leading his club back to prominence. Does the experience of being an Old Firm player help one deal with pressure? <br><br>&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every big moment has stresses and lessons that you take into your managerial career. You can pass it down to the lads who work under you. And everybody knows you handled it.&rdquo; <br><br>* Path to glory <br>Born in Paisley in 1969, Paul Lambert enjoyed a career of extraordinary footballing achievement. He won the Scottish Cup with his home town team in 1987 and 10 years later helped Borussia Dortmund lift the Champions League by beating Juventus 3-1. Lambert also gained 40 caps, playing in the 1998 World Cup. He started his managerial career with Livingston. He then moved to England where he coached Wycombe Wanderers and Colchester United before taking over at Norwich City earlier this season. <br><br>Honours <br>SPL title 1997-98, 2000-01, 2001-02, 2003-04. <br>Scottish Cup 1986-87, 2000-01, 2003-04, 2004-2005. <br>League Cup 1997-98, 1999-2000, 2000-01, 2005-06. <br>Champions League 1996-97. <br>Scottish Hall of Fame 2009<br><br><h3 align="left">Not The View - Paul Lambert </h3><font color="#339933" face="Helvetica" size="3"><a class="external" href="http://www.ntvcelticfanzine.com/farewell+then/fwl+lambert.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ntvcelticfanzine.com/farewell%20then/fwl%20lambert.htm</a></font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">How           fitting that the end of the O&#39;Neill era should see the end of Paul Lambert&#39;s           Celtic career; Lambert, along with the likes of Sutton and Thompson,           was one of the O&#39;Neill&#39;s stalwarts.

Value for money? Maybe in 15 years time if he becomes           a successful Celtic manager, but for now we&#39;ll just have to ask our           questions. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Of           course these are the thoughts of a fan after a horrendous turn of events           and shouldn&#39;t cloud the fact that for the past eight seasons Paul Lambert           has been strapped to the front carriage of the Celtic roller coaster,           during which time he&#39;s collected eight winners medals, become the captain           of his country and been only the second man to captain the team in a           European final. Not bad for someone who spent his childhood being taken           to Ibrox.</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">           Lambert&#39;s career prior to Celtic was notable for a number of things;           his first winners medal in 1987 when the Buddies beat United 1:0 in           the Scottish Cup Final, his pivotal role in a tremendous Scotland U-21           side that won through to the semi-finals of the European Championships           in 1991, and the bizarre fact that Motherwell were prepared to let him           go for nothing as a result of a &pound;50 pay rise.</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">           Of course that turned out to be the best thing that happened - Dortmund           and a Champions League winners medal awaited him. The following season           he had to take stock of his position in Germany; on the field things           were fine but off it life was a bit more complex; his wife was finding           it difficult to settle in Germany away from her family, especially when           his son came down with pneumonia. The press began to speculate that           he would head back to Scotland. Both Celtic and Rangers were in a bit           of a state at the time. We were rebuilding after the Tommy Burns years,           Jansen was still building a team and it was felt that would take a couple           of seasons. Even though he&#39;d already bought five or six players the           midfield still looked light given that McStay had hung up his magic           wand in the summer. Rangers were in the final year of the Walter Smith           era and he had already announced his intention to leave. Jansen still           had access to the cheque book. Smith had already spent something like            &pound;25m and given that he was leaving even Murray was unlikely to sanction           any more buying. We looked like the favourites. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The           man charged with the task of setting up the deal was Jock Brown, the           newly appointed general manager of the club. The press didn&#39;t much care           for Jock (the fans weren&#39;t exactly leaping up and down with delirium           when he joined either) and the story quickly got round that Jock had           put the kybosh on the deal because he didn&#39;t think Lambert was worth           the money. Lambert himself appeared on Scotsport (in its pre-train wreck           format) telling the world that he didn&#39;t care what Jock Brown thought           of him as a player, plenty of other more respected football people rated           him. Someone in Celtic Park agreed, the deal was back on and soon he           was paraded in a Celtic tracksuit having finally signed for just over            &pound;1m. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The           start to his Celtic career suggested that luck wise Paul Lambert was           the equivalent of a black cat with a knack for smashing mirrors; played           two lost two. Just to rub it in, the first was against Rangers at Ibrox,           the second was at home to Motherwell (both were Regi Blinker horror           shows - first he turned to jelly against the huns, then he got himself           so wound up about making amends against Motherwell that he was sent           off after 10 minutes).</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">           Oddly enough his third game was also against Rangers. This time a last           second Stubbs header gave us a 1:1 draw on the night Gascoigne finally           saw red.</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Two           weeks later Lambert had his first winners medal, appearing as a sub           at Ibrox when the Hoops beat Dundee United 3:0 in the league Cup final.           Of course this was the season to end all seasons. Rangers were going           for 10-in-a-row. The unthinkable. On January 2nd they came to Celtic           Park. A win for them would have sent them 7 points clear at the top.           They had only lost one league game all season while Celtic had lost           five. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The           first half was a fairly even affair, both sides having chances but neither           could find the net. After the break Celtic quickly gained the upper           hand. Lambert, Burley and McNamara in particular took hold of the midfield           and after 66 minutes Burley drove the ball under Goram to give us the           lead. Three precious points could be on the way. With seconds remaining           and the fans screaming for the final whistle the ball bounced out to           Paul Lambert, and he planted it into Goram&#39;s top left hand corner. His           first goal for the club. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">He           got his second the following week, another spectacular goal, this time           at Fir Park. They might not have been very frequent, but you have to           say that his goals were often of the memorable variety. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">The           demise of John Barnes the following season has often been pinpointed           to the moment Henrik Larsson broke his leg in France, but even after           that Celtic weren&#39;t that disorganised . The loss of Lambert at Ibrox           really hammered a few nails into Digger&#39;s coffin, so important had he           become to the team. Burley           was transferred not long after and the wheels really came off. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Having           outlasted Barnes, lambert went on to play an integral part in Doctor           Jo&#39;s midfield, this time doing a lot of the spadework for Lubo Moravcik,           although during this time he was often afflicted with ankle problems           which would restrict his first team appearances. Who knows what might           have happened during the Doc&#39;s short reign had he not been deprived           of Lambert and so many other vital players for long spells because of           a succession of injuries. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">MON           became Lambert&#39;s fourth manager in as many years in 2000, by which time           he was a fixture in the first team and a key component in much of the           success we enjoyed during the first four years of O&#39;Neill&#39;s time in           charge. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Initial           doubts as to whether he could play in the same team as Neil Lennon -           a similar type of player - proved unfounded as they both played outstanding           roles in the UEFA Cup run of two seasons ago.</font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">           Having made his intentions clear about concentrating on the coaching           side of the game this season, his playing duties have been negligible           and he has made just seven appearances in the first team during 2004-05.           To put a positive spin on this arrangement, the club&#39;s indulgence of           his semi-retirement status could be seen as some reward for eight years           of outstanding service. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">While           he was never a Paul McStay, Lambert&#39;s contribution as a team player           couldn&#39;t be understated. He was loath to waste possession and his work           ethic seems to have been the product of somebody who rose up from the           bottom ranks of the game and who appreciated every success he achieved.           It also says a lot for him as a person that he was hugely respected           by the supporters of every team he played for. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">My           own favourite recollection of him was when he gave his Celtic jersey           to someone in the disabled section - after his goal against Rangers           if I&#39;m not mistaken. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">He&#39;s           bowing out of Celtic Park - with the best part of 300 appearances to           his name - to take on the thankless task of managing Livingston. Still,           he was never one for shirking a challenge, even if it meant a trip to           the dentist afterwards. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">Who           knows, if he makes a go of it we might well see him back some time in           the future. </font><font face="Helvetica" size="3">He           leaves with our best wishes and our appreciation for everything he&#39;s           done to bring success to Celtic during his eight seasons. He has been           a credit to himself and the club. </font><font size="1"><font face="Helvetica" size="3">AB           MURDOCH</font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> </font></font><br></div></div>
