Fall River had defeated the  touring Bhoys 1-0 and Joe Kennaway had been quite superb for the hosts,  making a lasting impression on Willie Maley. <br><br>Note: his real first name is actually &#39;James&#39; not &#39;Joe&#39;, but for some reason he has always been called &#39;Joe&#39; all his life.<br><br>Willie Maley needed a top  quality long term replacement for the great Thomson and with the unlucky  John Falconer struggling with a knee injury the manager turned his  attention to Joe Kennaway. He signed for the Bhoys on October 30th and made  his debut in a 2-2 league draw at Motherwell on Halloween (only a day after arriving off the boat from the US).<br><br>It  was to prove an astute signing by Maley. Joe Kennaway was a solid and  dependable keeper with excellent handling skills and ample courage. He  certainly revelled in the physical battles he endured with the robust  forwards of the day. He may not have been as agile or as graceful as John Thomson but few, if any, ever were. His reflexes were lightening quick  though and he earned a reputation as being an excellent penalty saver. He grew  to a be a noted expert in               the art of stopping penalty kicks, something that always comes in handy.<br><br>Some great achievements over the time with Joe Kennaway in goal, included winning the League title in  the 1934-35 season and again in 1937-38, aided by the return of Jimmy McMenemy (as assistant manager) who shored up the club after the increasing lack of attention as the supposed manager.<br><br>He won a Scottish Cup winners medal when Celtic beat Aberdeen 2-1 on 24 April 1937 in the incredible match which saw an attendance of 146,433.<br><br>Possibly Joe Kennaway&rsquo;s finest moment as a Celt came in the Empire Exhibition Trophy  in 1938 when he conceded just a single goal in four games as Celtic won  the tournament to be crowned the unofficial champions of Britain.<br><br>In  total, Joe Kennaway made 295 league &amp; Scottish Cup appearances for Celtic and won two league titles,  two Scottish Cups and the Empire Exhibition Trophy. A fine record, but that tally could have been greater, but Celtic were beginning to slide and the old hegemony was long ended.<br><br>He eventually  departed Parkhead in October 1939 and returned to Canada (leaving war-time Europe), and later moved to the US where he later coached the Brown University soccer team from 1946 to 1959.<br><br>As Joe Kennaway&#39;s career spanned practically the whole decade, his name for Celtic fans has become synonymous with the 1930&#39;s. It took a few years until Willie Miller arrived at Celtic, that Celtic finally had adequately replaced Kennaway in goals. Some of the following incumbents had really poor records.<br><br>Joe Kennaway is  credited as having been capped for his native Canada  and Scotland, and he would have played more times for Scotland, if the other British  nations had not objected to a Canadian playing in goal for Scotland. What is undeniable is the fact that Joe  Kennaway was an excellent keeper and a fine Celt, and fitted in very well in difficult circumstances. The club was slowly entering a decline but he was one of those who helped prop the First team up, and collected some great medals along the way.<br><br>Some say that he may actually have played for the US national team, but there is <span class="diffRemove">some </span>doubt on that front, and the record books seem to shun that this ever happened. So the point is deemed as untrue.<br><br>Joe Kennaway sadly passed away in 1969 after a sudden heart-attack. He is buried in Highland Memorial Park, in Rhode Island USA.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>   <h3>  Playing Career </h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1  WPC-edit-border-all  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br><br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH  CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">   <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">1931-39</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">263</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">32</td>   <td align="center" width="16%">n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">295</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Shut-outs:</td><td align="center" width="16%">75</td><td align="center" width="16%">8</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">83<br>(28%)</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Honours with Celtic</h3><b>Empire Exhibition Cup<br></b><ul><li><h3><font><font size="2"><a href="/page/Empire+Exhibition+Cup" target="_self">1938</a></font></font></h3></li></ul><b>Scottish League</b><br><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/1936" target="_self">1935-36</a>, <a href="/page/1938" target="_self">1937-38</a></font></li></ul><b>Scottish Cup</b><br><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1932-33" target="_self">1933</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1936-37" target="_self">1937</a> </font></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>   <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Kennaway%2C+Joe+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><div><h3>Forums</h3></div><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/celtic_graves/kennaway-joe-1931-1939-100-t316.html#p3879" target="_self">CGS Thread</a></li></ul></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Medals for Sale (2013)</h3>The Medals and Awards of the goalkeeper James &lsquo;Joe&rsquo; Kennaway, who played 311 games for Celtic FC between 1931 and 1939:<br>http://www.dnw.co.uk/auctions/catalogue/lot.php?auction_id=300&amp;lot_id=437<br><br>Province  of Quebec Football Association, 1926 Charity Cup, an openwork gold  badge by Mappin &amp; Webb, football set in lozenge, back named  (C.P.R.F.C., J.

His goalkeeping prowess at the Montreal C.P.R.  team in the early 1920s brought him to the attention of Canadian scouts  and he was capped to play for Canada against the USA at Ebbets Field,  Brooklyn in 1926. In 1927 he signed for Providence, RI, who competed in  the American Soccer League. The Providence team changed ownership and  moved their base to Fall River, MA, and faced a touring Celtic team on  31 May 1931. Kennaway&rsquo;s performance in that game led to him being signed  by Celtic manager Willie Maley to replace the late John Thomson, who  fractured his skull at Ibrox Park in the Rangers v Celtic game on 5  September 1931 and died later that day from his injuries. Kennaway made  his debut for Celtic at the age of 26 in their 2-2 away draw at Fir  Park, Motherwell on 31 October 1931, a day after disembarking from the  transatlantic liner Duchess of Richmond. Between then and the home  fixture against Clyde on 2 September 1939, Kennaway made 311 appearances  for his club in all competitions and, in the days when country swapping  for footballers was a common occurrence, he was capped for Scotland  against Austria in their 2-2 draw at Hampden Park on 29 November 1933.  Earlier that year he won his first Scottish Cup winners medal when  Celtic beat Motherwell 1-0 and the Glasgow Herald reported that  &ldquo;Kennaway alone kept Motherwell from scoring&rdquo;. He won a second such  medal when Celtic vanquished Aberdeen 2-1 on 24 April 1937 at Hampden  Park, watched by no less than 147,365 people, believed to be the third  largest attendance ever at a football match in the British Isles, with a  further 20,000 people locked outside the gates. Celtic, with Kennaway  in goal, won the Scottish league championship in 1934-5 and 1937-8, and  also won the Empire Exhibition Cup in 1938 against teams from Rangers,  Aberdeen, Heart of Midlothian, Sunderland, Brentford, Chelsea and  Everton. <br><br>On the outbreak of War Kennaway returned to Canada. He coached  the Brown University soccer team at Providence, RI, from 1946-59,  becoming an American citizen in 1948<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>  Joe Kennaway Montreal&rsquo;s World Class Goalkeeper</h3><br>  http://www.soccerreportextra.com/domestic/scottish-leagues/celtic/joe-kennaway-montreal%E2%80%99s-world-class-goalkeeper/<br>Written by Colin Jose on October 12, 2010 | 3 Comments &raquo;<br>Posted in Celtic, History and Books <br><br>It was Saturday, September 5, 1931 and a crowd of 75,000 fans jammed the stands and terracing of Glasgow&rsquo;s Ibrox Stadium to watch the traditional clash between Rangers and Celtic.<br><br>Just five minutes into the second half Rangers attacked down the right wing, the ball was worked in to the centre and just as Rangers centre forward Sam English was in the motion of shooting, John Thomson, Celtic&rsquo;s Scottish international goalkeeper, threw himself at his feet. <br><br>Both players went down, the ball spun away. English got up and bent over Thomson, but Thomson did not get up, and instantly it seemed that the players on both sides realized that Thomson had been seriously injured. <br><br>A hush fell over the crowd as Thomson was carried off. Later that night Thomson died in a Glasgow Infirmary of what the Glasgow Herald described as a &ldquo;depressed fracture of the skull.&rdquo; He was just 23 years old.<br><br>Four days later John Thomson was buried in his hometown of Cardenden in Fife. Two special trains carried mourners from Glasgow. A crowd estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000 attended the funeral. <br><br>Two months after the tragic death of John Thomson a young Canadian arrived in Glasgow, it was Friday October 30 and he had just stepped off the liner Duchess of Richmond from Montreal. <br><br>His task was to fill the void in the Celtic goal, his name was Joe Kennaway.<br><br>One day later, with hardly enough time to be introduced to his team mates, he ran out at Fir Park in Motherwell with the rest of the Celtic team for the Scottish First Division encounter between the two teams. <br><br>Joe Kennaway - Celtic, Canada and Scotland<br><br>The following day the Glasgow Sunday Post headline read &ldquo;Kennaway Has Come to Stay.&rdquo; The Post commented &ldquo;Kennaway&rsquo;s style of taking high shots took the breath away from one at times.&rdquo;<br><br>James (Joe) Kennaway was born in Point St. Charles, Montreal on January 25, 1905, one of a family of four. His father and mother had migrated to Canada from Dundee and all their children were born in Canada.<br><br>His goalkeeping prowess first attracted attention when he was playing for the old Montreal C.P.R. team during the early 1920s, and while he was with them he made his one and only appearance for Canada against the United States at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn in 1926.<br><br>One year later he was signed by the Providence, Rhode Island club playing in the professional American Soccer League. He stayed with them until February 1931 when the Providence team was moved to Fall River, Massachusetts.<br><br>In those days it was customary for at least one British team to tour Canada and the United States during the summer. In 1931 it was the turn of Glasgow Celtic and when they faced Fall River on May 31, Joe Kennaway was in goal for the Massachusetts team, and his performance on that day led indirectly to his signing for Celtic. <br><br>As you might expect Kennaway took a while to settle down in Glasgow, but soon made the Celtic goalkeeping job his own. In 1933 he won his first honours in Scottish football winning a cup winners medal as Celtic beat Motherwell 1-0 before 102,339 at Hampden Park in Glasgow. The Glasgow Herald commented. &ldquo;Kennaway alone kept Motherwell from scoring.&rdquo;<br><br>His work quickly won him selection for the Scottish national team and played against the great Austrian &ldquo;Wunderteam&rdquo; at Hampden Park on November 29, 1933. The game ended in a 2-2 tie. <br><br>But it was to be Kennaway&rsquo;s only appearance for the full Scottish national team as the other British nations objected to a Canadian playing in goal for Scotland. Still he did play four times for the Scottish League team, first against the Irish league in 1932 and then two games against the Football League team of England in 1934 followed by another game against the Irish League in the same year.<br><br>Celtic, with Kennaway in goal, won the Scottish League championship in the 1934-35 season and repeated in 1937-38. He also won a second Scottish Cup winners medal when Celtic beat Aberdeen 2-1 on April 24, 1937 at Hampden Park. The attendance on that day was an unbelievable 146,433.<br><br>But perhaps his finest hour came in the Empire Exhibition Cup of 1938. With the competition being held in Glasgow, the competition involved Celtic, Rangers, Aberdeen and Hearts from Scotland and Sunderland, Brentford, Chelsea and Everton from England.<br><br><br>Of the game against Sunderland one paper said &ldquo;Celtic can thank their lucky stars and Joe Kennaway that they have a second chance tonight. Only the brilliance of Kennaway, who had half a dozen miraculous saves prevented an English success to mark the opening of the tourney.&rdquo; Celtic eventually won the tournament beating Everton in the final before 82,000 at Ibrox Park.<br><br>When the first inductees into the new Soccer Hall of Fame and Museum were named in 2000, Joe Kennaway, as befitting one of Canada&rsquo;s finest athletes, headed the list of the first 22 an honour and recognition long overdue.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Kennaway a Celtic hero in Scotland<br></h3>http://www.canadasoccer.com/kennaway-a-celtic-hero-in-scotland-p150691<br>Posted on 26 May 2012 in Canadian soccer history<br><br>In 1928, newspaper men raved about a young Montr&eacute;al goalkeeper named Joe Kennaway. The Montr&eacute;al CPR star of the 1928 Charity Cup match at Stade Molson, it was written that &quot;in that game alone Kennaway proved himself one of the finest Canadian players of all time.&quot;<br><br>From that 1:0 victory and clean sheet in the Charity Cup match, Kennaway launched a professional career that started in eastern USA, but then prospered for eight seasons in Scotland with renowned Glasgow club Celtic. He won two Scottish League titles and two Scottish Cups from 1931 to 1939, only returning home to Canada after the outbreak of the Second World War.<br><br>How Kennaway came to play in Celtic was the result of another typical strong performance in 1931 against his future team. Now with Fall River FC in the American Soccer League, Kennaway was the difference in a 1:0 victory over touring Celtic in North Tiverton, RI. Just over three months later after goalkeeper John Thomson was fatally injured in a match, Celtic called for the Canadian to serve as Thomson&#39;s replacement.<br><br>In James Handley&#39;s The Celtic Story, it was written that manager &quot;Willie Maley remembered the lively display that Joe Kennaway of Fall River Football Club had given in the recent American tour and invited him over. On 31 October Kennaway made his first appearance in Celtic&#39;s goal in a match against Motherwell and soon proved that the performance he had put up against the celebrated visitors had been no mere flash in the pan.&quot;<br><br>Over eight seasons, Kennaway made 295 appearances for Celtic, winning the Scottish League title in 1935-36 and 1937-38, as well as Scottish Cup titles in 1933 and 1937. In his first Scottish Cup final on 15 April 1933 against Motherwell, he posted a clean sheet at Hampden Park in front of 102,000 fans in attendance.<br><br>In 1935-36, Kennaway and Celtic tied a franchise record by posting 32 wins in a 38-match season. The team&#39;s record was an impenetrable 32-2-4. So outstanding was Kennaway that he was one of two Celtic players featured in the &quot;Popular Footballers&quot; picture card set of 1936 United Kingdom footballers (produced by Carreras Limited).<br><br>In 1937, Kennaway second Scottish Cup followed a 2:1 victory over Aberdeen in the final. The following season, it was back to the top of the Scottish League standings, posting a record of 27 wins, seven draws and four loses.<br><br>He soon took over as soccer coach at Brown University, a position he held from 1946 to 1959. After passing away in 1969, he was posthumously honoured by both the New England Soccer Hall of Fame (1997) and The Soccer Hall of Fame in Canada (inaugural class in 2000).<div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><i>Many thanks to Football historian Colin Jose for the information below, Mr Jose has been a great help to the Celtic Wiki in the past and his continued input is greatly appreciated.<br><br></i></div><div></div><div>When Joe left Scotland in 1939 he did not go back to the United States, he went back to Canada, home to Montreal.There he coached (and maybe played) a team in the Montreal and District League named WINGS.<br>I don&#39;t have the record of this team, but have always intended to check it out and the length of time it operated.If you have micro film of the Montreal Gazette or the Montreal Star, in Glasgow, you can verify what I am saying.<br>Also Joe was inducted into the New England Soccer Hall of Fame in 1997, after his death of course.I was a guest at the ceremony held in the Portuguese Club in Cranston, Rhode Island.<br>Also a guest was Joe&#39;s son Grant, and other members of his family.I was asked to speak and spoke about Joe&#39;s career.Interesting enough, also inducted at the same time was Bert Patenaude (also deceased) who played for the United States at the World Cup of 1950.<br>You can find the New England Soccer Hall of Fame on line.<br><br>With Best Wishes,Colin Jose<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>Joe Kennaway is buried in Highland Memorial Park, in Rhode Island USA (Plot 24, Grave 1).</div><div>Source: <br><img align="bottom" alt="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114312423#view-photo=85010598" height="391" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/b0882a18e2f22393da0b97a0a47c1ff1/GW588H391" title="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114312423#view-photo=85010598" width="588"></div><div><img align="bottom" alt="Joe Kennaway signs." height="1167" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/70bc8ef6fa405ccd7f5402684626f0fb/GW397H1167" title="Joe Kennaway signs." width="397"></div><div></div><div><span class="diffAdd">  </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class="diffAdd">New Info on goalkeeper Joe Kennaway&rsquo;s life after Celtic</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">By Editor 16 May, 2020 </span><br><span class="diffAdd">https://thecelticstar.com/new-info-on-goalkeeper-joe-kennaways-life-after-celtic/</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I am writing from the State of Maine, USA. I read with great interest David Potter&rsquo;s recent article on Joe Kennaway, the former Celtic goalkeeper. I had the good fortune during my undergraduate years at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island to play for Joe, who was Brown&rsquo;s part-time soccer coach from 1946-1959.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">You acknowledge that little is known of Joe&rsquo;s post-Celtic career. The following information might help fill-in some of the gaps for the Celtic support.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">After WWII, Joe returned to the US and settled in Providence, Rhode Island, his wife Loretta&rsquo;s home town. He was employed by Brown and Sharpe, the famous Providence machine tool builders firm.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Joe became a U.S. citizen in 1948. He was inducted into the inaugural class of the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame in 2000. As you most likely know, he was one of the rare international soccer players who had caps for two national teams &mdash; the Canadians (against the US. in Brooklyn in 1926) and Scotland (against Austria at Hampden Park in 1933).</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Joe died in Johnston, Rhode Island on 7 March 1969, regrettably to little notice here in the US and even in Canada.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">One of the highlights of the Kennaway era at Brown was the annual invite to the varsity players to his favorite pub in Central Falls, Rhode Island. He brought his huge scrapbook from his Celtic playing days and regaled us with stories of his celebrated career. We were all spellbound and enjoyed interacting with his drinking buddies.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Thank you so very much for writing this very informative article on Joe&rsquo;s storied career with the Celtic. For your interest, I am attaching a 2018 posting by Frank Dell&rsquo; Apa on the Fall River FC&rsquo;s 1-nil victory over the Celtic in May of 1931.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">P.S. On a personal note, I scored the lone goal in the last victory of Joe&rsquo;s coaching career &mdash; a shot off the right post in the waning minutes of the match at Cornell University in the fall of 1959.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Howard R Whitcomb </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
