The problem was that Sunderland was a club going nowhere and under management difficulties. There were some great moments, including a reflex save v Bolton which in 2012 was voted as the best save in the 20 year history of the English Premier League.  <br><br>However, injuries were to blight his time and from season 2008-09, he was in &amp; out the first team due to recurring injuries and surgery. <br><br>After being let go in 2012 from Sunderland, he did not manage to sign for a club for two years when Celtic picked him up, and things were to finally get back on track again.<br><b><br>Ronnie Deila Era</b><br>He had a lot of lost time to make up for, and a lot of pride as well. After everything, getting a chance at Celtic was probably beyond his dreams and an opportunity that he just had to grasp by the nettle. <br><br>If the challenge wasn&#39;t daunting enough, he was to take over from Fraser Forster who had made a name for himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the UK at Celtic, and had set new records for clean sheets in goals. Craig was to be up for the challenge, and more than met what could ever be asked of him.<br><br><div>  Gordon&#39;s time was to begin like a fairytale. After all the heartache of recent years, he cemented the Celtic First XI goalkeeper spot, and was a consummate professional. Even when the side was playing poorly, Gordon&#39;s saves were what were keeping the side in the game. In the first half of the season this was too often the difference between defeat and victory, and the quality of his performances belied his rather calm demeanour. <br><br>When Celtic won the league cup in 2014-15, there was no prouder moment than seeing Craig Gordon with his children feeling redemption tasting success, he truly deserved it. His career was regarded by all as over only a year or so earlier, and it was through good faith and a leap of faith by Celtic to give him his place. He&#39;d repaid everyone back already. It was a humbling story. <br><br>As one commentator was to put it, everyone was running out of superlatives to describe Gordon&#39;s form. He was saving Celtic and at times carrying the first team. His fine form fitted in well with his central defence, and the popular centre half duo of van Dijk and Denayer gained much from playing in front of him. Ironically led to his front men winning end of season awards and plaudits ahead of him.<br><br>As happens, assistant manager John Collins remarked unnecessarily in an interview that Craig Gordon&#39;s transfer was on par with Henrik Larsson&#39;s. Pure hyperbole and an unnecessary burden for the player. So in the following match v Inter Milan in the Uefa Cup (2015) he duly had a notable poor match gifting two goals from uncharacteristic mistakes. Thankfully the team rallied to draw at home but everyone hopefully had learnt a lesson. <br><br>As a measure of his success, Craig Gordon was named Scottish Football Writers&#39; Player of the Year. The whole arc of his season was inspiring, and to be awarded this by the journalists appears apt. Gordon never hid his joy and relief, and his honesty about his predicament really brought it all home if what the had endured just to get here. He was genuinely thankful and it was humbling to the support, but his performances meant we were in his debt too. Celtic mat have won the double that season but it meant more to Gordon than anyone else for good reason, the true reward being something more deeply personal. <br><br>One of the more humourous games he played in was the inaugural match  against TheRangers in February 2015. Despite all the pre-match hype  about a belligerent match, TheRangers had only one shot on goal and it  was way off target. Craig Gordon had probably the easiest 90minutes he  will ever have in goals. The comments afterwards made light of the  situation with messages passing around such as that post-match Craig  Gordon had to be taken to hospital after the match due to hypothermia. <br><br>After that wonderful debut season, things didn&#39;t necessarily reach those heights again under Deila but Celtic were still on top although the side were faltering. The departure of the wonderful central defence of Denayer and van Dijk lost him a crux in the defence, and his form fell with it. Numerous goals were being lost from set pieces, and the Ronny Deila era was sinking fast with the defence a notable bugbear.<br><br>Quite a contrast to the past season, and Gordon had lost a lot of confidence it seemed. Not the most confident with the ball at his feet, his distribution was often poor (and never improved thru his entire time at Celtic). Errors were increasing too, such as the away lost goal v Fernerbahce which resulted from an unenforced calamity involving Gordon. Didn&#39;t help that his defenders were unsettled and too often rotated (partly due to injuries). Things had to change, and they did under Brendan Rodgers</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><br>Brendan Rodgers Era &amp; Beyond<br></b></div>  Brendan Rodgers managerial reign was a breath of fresh air, and for Gordon it was another time to reboot, but unlike others it was a trickier transition it seemed. Craig Gordon was one who seemed to always need a reboot in his career.<br><br>An early debacle in a Champions League qualifier in Aug 2016 v Hapoel led to the introduction of the manager&#39;s old club favourite De Vries who took over from Gordon soon enough. If anything, the competition was welcome. As De Vries faltered, Craig Gordon was soon dragged back, and his form unsurprisingly reappeared, and with a defence in front of him who were once again functioning he was producing fine performances again. If there was one bit of luck, he missed out on the 7-0 thumping by Barcelona.<br><br>As a measure of his reputation, Chelsea stepped in for Gordon for a &pound;3m offer as a back-up keeper in Jan 2017. If he had opted for this at his age and at his stage in his career, in fairness few would have begrudged him, but he stayed for various reasons, which created further respect for him. <br><br>As Gordon was to finally find his form again, many were loathe to lose him. He was another who had their careers boosted by Brendan Rodgers, and his part in the back-to-back treble seasons cannot be understated, especially with the long record unbeaten run being a clear indication of his value to the Celtic team.<br><br>One iconic moment came as Celtic won the treble, and as scene was replayed repeatedly of Gordon sinking to the ground, with clenched fists in the air with the mass Celtic support in view celebrating after the end of the dramatic Scottish Cup final v Aberdeen in 2017. Captured the emotions of the moment and the era.<br><br>However, into season 2017-18, his faults seemed to resurface and there were concerns. Gordon really was poor at distribution of the ball, and was not comfortable with the ball at his feet too often. This was a weakness that many had complained of. The defence in front of him was not functioning too well, and this all combined to see Celtic dip in form, but still remain dominant. Gordon though needed to work harder, but there were concerns it was now getting too late in his career to iron out these faults. He was really uncomfortable with the ball at his feet way too often giving the ball away to the opposition.<br><br>The defence could be quite a concern, and some pointed to the often lack of confidence in Gordon that hampered efforts especially in European matches where Celtic were humiliated by PSG. On paper, Gordon was doing a fine job in season 2017/18 with the goals conceded generally remaining low again, with just 25 goals conceded in the league, and Celtic won back-to-back domestic trebles.<br><br>Season 2018/19 was to be a crux season for him, and as Celtic stuttered in the league and in Europe, criticisms in general of Rodgers &amp; Celtic that had been bottled had finally opened up into the public. Gordon was part of this, but he wasn&#39;t the biggest issue. <br><br>Into mid-season 2018-19, he was finally overtaken by Scott Bain in goals who was increasingly showing confidence and reminding all of the best of what Craig Gordon had been offering. It was clear that Bain was learning from Gordon, and it was a boon to have both on the club&#39;s books at the same time.  One big advantage of Bain was that he was far more confident with the ball at his feet, which was a major issue as playing the ball back to the goalkeeper was an increasingly used tactic, and too often Gordon with the ball at his feet gave fans the jips.<br><br>[return of Forster in season 2019/20]<br><br>He was a very capable goalkeeper who when on form with confidence was top level. A great shot stopper and good teammate on the pitch to work with. When his confidence dipped, he was a major problem.<br><br><div>He was very well decorated, and his decision to come to Celtic was very much vindicated.</div><div></div>Must add a noted on the amount of charity related work with Celtic he has done, including the Celtic Park sleepout which he has done a few times. During the summer while majority of the players were on holidays he was with the Celtic Foundation in Kenya helping out. <br><br><br>[...tbc...]<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3"

Craig Swan<br><br>THE Celtic stopper spent two years out of the game recovering from knee operations and Gordon is savouring every moment of the League Cup win after fearing he&#39;d never play again.<br><br>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/craig-gordon-out-football-long-5342223<br><br>CRAIG GORDON stopped for a moment in the final seconds at Hampden.<br><br>With the League Cup in the bag and referee Bobby Madden preparing to sound the final whistle, the emotional-keeper took a deep breath and looked all around him.<br><br>When he did so, he didn&rsquo;t just see packed stands full of Celtic fans partying.<br><br>Gordon also saw those long days when he wondered if he&rsquo;d ever  experience such an  occasion again as his thoughts soon drifted to his family &ndash; and his two young daughters, Freya and Emma.<br><br>It was a dark two years he spent fighting to recover from the knee operations which threatened to deny him from ever-again savouring this trophy feeling on a football pitch. Gordon was almost overcome by the emotions.<br><br>Walking up the steps and collecting a medal for the first time in nine years since helping Hearts to the Scottish Cup, the 32-year-old had every right to soak it up.<br><br>And, as he stood in the bowels of Hampden  afterwards, Gordon reflected: &ldquo;I did take a moment or two towards the end to think of things.<br><br>&ldquo;When the game was already won and United weren&rsquo;t going to get back into it, it was nice to stand at the other end of the pitch and have a look around at the fans celebrating and singing the songs.<br><br>&ldquo;I just wanted to take it all in, that this was really happening for me.<br><br>&ldquo;I managed to do that. I&rsquo;ve won a cup again and it&rsquo;s been a long time coming since the last one.<br><br>&ldquo;To be honest, at one stage, I just wanted to play a game of football again and once I managed that I realised I was capable of getting back to a high level. That&rsquo;s when I started to think about what is possible. But to do this in my first season back is just amazing.<br><br>&ldquo;When I first signed for Celtic, Fraser Forster was still here.<br><br>&ldquo;So to get in and have 40 games under my belt plus a medal in the bank is hard to contemplate.<br><br>&ldquo;It was always the aim to get back to the best level that I possibly could. So to have done that and to already have won a trophy at Hampden and to have a medal in my pocket is more than anything I could have ever have hoped for when coming back.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dream come true, all  over again.&rdquo;<br><br>Craig Gordon lifts the Scottish League Cup<br><br>Having savoured his own  personal moment, Gordon&rsquo;s thoughts immediately switched to the loved ones who backed him in every step of his rehabilitation.<br><br>Both Freya and Emma joined him on the pitch for the post-match celebrations and, poignantly, he added: &ldquo;It was nice to be able to do that for them.<br><br>&ldquo;They have stood by me and they have supported me for two whole years when I wasn&rsquo;t working.<br><br>&ldquo;When I was concentrating fully on getting back into football, it must have been a hard thing for them to have to deal with.<br><br>&ldquo;They were so young they  never really knew what daddy did for a living. They were a big part of my inspiration to get back to top-level football. I wanted to show them what their daddy used to do!<br><br>&ldquo;It means the world to me to share that moment with my girls out there on the pitch and they absolutely loved it, dancing around and picking up all the confetti. It was special for me and for my family, a moment I will never forget.<br><br>&ldquo;To come from where I was, all the hard work makes it special.<br><br>&ldquo;At times it might have been easier to give up, but  the support I&rsquo;ve had to keep going, to carry on and to get to here is  just brilliant.&rdquo;<br><br>Gordon, however, admitted that his time for reflection would not, or could not, last.<br><br>Such is the nature of life at Celtic, one trophy had no sooner been collected than thoughts turned to the next.<br><br>Celtic go back into action for  part-three of their battles with Dundee United when the teams clash in Wednesday&rsquo;s William Hill Scottish Cup quarter-final replay  at Parkhead.<br><br>With the Treble firmly in his  mind, Gordon said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t look  back because we&rsquo;ve got a busy  run-in to come.<br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a difficult game on Wednesday and this might give United an added incentive to come out and have an even bigger go.<br><br>United played pretty well today even with 10 men. They stuck to their tasks and are a tough team to break down.<br><br>&ldquo;So if we&rsquo;re not at our best, 100 per cent ready, they&rsquo;ll have every chance to do well against us.&rdquo;<br><br>However, there is no question Celtic will now go into the clash on a major high.<br><br>Gordon, who didn&rsquo;t lose a single goal in the League Cup run, was  also keen to acknowledge the achievement of boss Ronny Deila in the lifting of the trophy.<br><br>Having been surrounded by doubts in the opening weeks of  his reign, the Norwegian is now excelling and enjoying his job.<br><br>With the pressure of winning the first trophy now lifted from his shoulders, Deila is charging for a domestic clean sweep and the keeper is on board.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;It feels brilliant,  absolutely fantastic. It&rsquo;s the manager&rsquo;s first competition and he&rsquo;s won it, so it&rsquo;s great for him,<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also great for me personally.&rdquo;<font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Craig Gordon &lsquo;gave up pay-out to rescue career&rsquo; <br>by STEPHEN HALLIDAY <br>published 23:52 Tuesday 19 May 2015 <br> <br><a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/craig-gordon-gave-up-pay-out-to-rescue-career-1-3777634" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/craig-gordon-gave-up-pay-out-to-rescue-career-1-3777634</a> </h3></font><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">JUST a matter of weeks before he put pen to paper for Celtic, one flourish of Craig Gordon&rsquo;s signature would have ended his playing career at a stroke and earned him a seven-figure insurance pay-out. <br><br>As he savours being named Scotland&rsquo;s Player of the Year for 2014-15, the 32-year-old has revealed for the first time just how close he came to giving up on his often torturous battle to recover from the serious knee injury which sidelined him for the best part of three years. <br><br>&ldquo; To get the pay-out, I would have had to officially retire and not play any form of professional football. It would have gone to a settlement and it was pretty close to getting the go-ahead <br>Craig Gordon <br><br>Gordon has been rewarded for his perseverance, spectacularly restoring his reputation as one of Scotland&rsquo;s finest ever goalkeepers this season as his exceptional form has helped Celtic retain the Scottish Premiership title and win the League Cup. <br><br>He has also reclaimed his place in the Scotland squad and vindicated the belief of those closest to him, most notably his wife, Jennifer, that he could revive a career which he now hopes he can extend successfully until he is 40. <br> <br>&ldquo;There were quite a few people within the game who told me that it was perhaps time to give up,&rdquo; said Gordon. <br><br>&ldquo;I had the possibility of getting an insurance pay-out had the worst come to the worst and I kept putting that off trying to get back. It was getting very close to the time limit expiring on that and I had to make a  decision on whether to continue trying to play or take the money and run. <br><br>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t long left on the policy as it had been a two-year thing, so it was very close. The paperwork was all looked out, I had spoken to lawyers, and it was very far down the road to happening. So I turned my back on a very large sum of money to give it another go. <br><br>&ldquo;Things could have gone wrong after that but I wanted to give myself that opportunity. In my old age, if I had taken the money and not given myself that final chance, I don&rsquo;t think that would have sat well with me. </font><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">&ldquo;To get the pay-out, I would have had to officially retire and not play any form of professional football. It would have gone to a settlement and it was pretty close to getting the go-ahead. <br><br>&ldquo;My wife has been very supportive. She was the one who would tell me to keep going and keep trying. I couldn&rsquo;t fault the support I&rsquo;ve had from family and friends. Everyone has been right behind me. <br><br>&ldquo;I hope I can play on for as long as possible now. I&rsquo;ve seen what it looks like not playing. Although it was nice spending time at home with my two young girls, I want to play football for as long as I can. You&rsquo;re a long time retired and I got a little glimpse of that during my time out. I know how lucky I am to be able to keep playing. <br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to try keep playing until I&rsquo;m 40, if my body holds up to it. I see Brad Friedel has just announced his retirement aged 43, so that gives me another ten and a half years! I could have a while yet. <br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see me moving on from Celtic, certainly not at the moment. I&rsquo;m very happy here and the manager has been great with me. We&rsquo;ve got a really good relationship and I work very well with goalkeeping coach Stevie Woods as well. I&rsquo;m looking forward to next season and giving the Champions League a go.&rdquo; <br><br>In becoming the fifth Celtic player in the last seven years to win the Scottish Football Writers&rsquo; Association&rsquo;s Player of the Year honour, and only the sixth in the 51-year history of the prize to claim it twice, Gordon has exceeded his own expectations in his first season with the Parkhead club. <br><br>He signed on initially as deputy to Fraser Forster, although in the knowledge the big English international was likely to be moving on. Since Forster&rsquo;s &pound;10 million sale to Southampton last August, Gordon has hardly looked back. <br><br>&ldquo;I had loads of doubts when I first signed,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;Fraser was still here, I didn&rsquo;t have a great deal of options regarding what I was going to do. I didn&rsquo;t know if it was the right decision to come in at this level and fight for a first-team spot, or should I have dropped down a level or two, get first-team games and try to work my way back that way. There were a lot of doubts whether I had done the right thing coming here. Anything could have happened from that point. I could be sitting here at the end of the season having not played a game and not achieved anything. And then I would have been kicking myself for not going and getting games under my belt. <br><br>&ldquo;I was ambitious enough, though, and wanted to go in as high as I could. I wanted to prove I could still play at this level and thankfully I&rsquo;ve been able to do that. <br><br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really set myself a minimum target for the season. I wanted to play some games, but I didn&rsquo;t have an exact figure in mind. But if Fraser had stayed here, maybe I would have just played in the cup matches or before or after a European game if they were resting players. I really didn&rsquo;t know. <br><br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the manager coming in, his philosophy or his thinking. So it was a step into the unknown. I just wanted to back myself as I had done that throughout my rehab to get back. I was confident I could get back to those levels, but I didn&rsquo;t have an awful lot to back that up. I had to go out and prove it. Thankfully, I managed to do that. <br><br>&ldquo;Fraser moving on was how I wanted it to pan out. That was the best-case scenario for me and it happened. I knew there was also a chance I could have suffered another injury, or broken down in pre-season, and they then brought another goalkeeper in or Lukasz Zaluska could have played well in the first game and kept his place. So there were loads of variables that could have happened. In my mindset, Fraser leaving was the way I wanted it to happen and that&rsquo;s the way it ended up.&rdquo; <br><br>Gordon has a few memorable moments to cherish from a season in which he feels he has been an even better goalkeeper than when he first won the Player of the Year award when at Hearts in 2006, forging the reputation which earned him a &pound;9m move to Sunderland. <br><br>For Celtic, his amazing display in the 2-2 Europa League draw away to Salzburg and the stunning late double save in a 2-1 league win at St Johnstone in February stand out. But it is his return to the international fold, especially his first starting appearance for Scotland in almost four years against Northern Ireland at Hampden in March, which tops his list. <br><br>&ldquo;I was walking out behind Darren Fletcher that night, who was captain for the first time in a while after his battle with illness,&rdquo; recalls Gordon. &ldquo;I tapped him on the shoulder and said &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve not done this for a while&rsquo;. It was like going back to the old days. That was a nice moment to share with him. We haven&rsquo;t spoken about our individual circumstances at great length, but there&rsquo;s a shared understanding there. <br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve both been down a similar path and missed about 300 games and a lot of international caps between us. But these things happen to footballers everywhere. It&rsquo;s about how you react to that and whether you have the strength to come back. Darren has done fantastically well to do that. <br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a different goalkeeper now to when I was Player of the Year the first time. I was 24 when I won it the last time, so there&rsquo;s a lot changed within my game. I&rsquo;ve changed technically a few things that have helped me to cope with the injury and, overall, it&rsquo;s improved my goalkeeping in general. <br><br>&ldquo;Coming to Celtic, there&rsquo;s been a different style of play, having to play out from the back, having a higher line and having to be a sweeper at times, is something I hadn&rsquo;t done too much of at my previous clubs. That&rsquo;s been a change. Now having experienced all those different styles of play, I think I&rsquo;m better now than when I won the award before. <br><br>&ldquo;The Salzburg and St Johnstone games stand out for me with Celtic so far. The Salzburg game set us up to get through the group stage in the Europa League, while the saves so late at St Johnstone felt important because the league was still quite tight with Aberdeen at that stage.&rdquo; <br><br>It hasn&rsquo;t all been plain sailing for Gordon, of course, with his red card in the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness at Hampden a low point. After all he has been through, however, a sense of perspective is easy for him to find. <br><br>&ldquo;We were still winning 1-0 when I went off, so I don&rsquo;t know what happened after that,&rdquo; he smiles. &ldquo;It was nothing to do with me. Seriously, though, these things happen. It was disappointing. On that day we didn&rsquo;t play particularly well, even in the first half. <br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the second time I&rsquo;ve been sent off and only the third or fourth penalty I&rsquo;ve conceded in my career. You hope these things won&rsquo;t happen in big games, but I remember Jens Lehmann being sent off in the Champions League final for something similar. <br><br>&ldquo;You just have to take it on the chin and try to put it out of your mind. I&rsquo;ve probably become better at doing that with experience. It helps you to do that, having come back from two years out.&rdquo; <font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3></font><h3></h3><br><br></font><br><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"><br></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><img align="bottom" alt="Gordon, Craig - The Celtic Wiki" height="1200" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/437acb66b5bb08a34eff6219cd440a4d/GW479H1200" title="Gordon, Craig - The Celtic Wiki" width="479"><br><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font></font><h3>The forgotten men grab the silver for Celtic  </h3>  Surveying the scene as the ticker tape fell, two men caught the eye at Hampden .    Not Scott Brown - from slumped by the road-side to looking at the stars in the space of four days. Nor Ronny Deila, who had won his first trophy as Celtic manager. Nor Stefan Johansen, man of the match in a final that was enjoyable but too one-sided to be considered fully absorbing.  Craig Gordon kept another clean sheet as Celtic lifted the Scottish league Cup.    Craig Gordon kept another clean sheet as Celtic lifted the Scottish league Cup.    The first guy was Craig Gordon, the day&#39;s great Cinderella story. Gordon&#39;s comeback from injury and near-retirement has been remarkable, a tale of quality goalkeeping, of course, but also of perseverance.    Gordon has been to some pretty dark places on his journey back. He was a forgotten man. Written-off. Unwanted. A &pound;9m goalkeeper with no goal to keep. It was Celtic&#39;s wisdom that made them sign him. It&#39;s been Gordon&#39;s brilliance that has made the move a success.    The concept of footballers as role models is a hopelessly flawed one, but if you had to pick a character to fit the bill then you wouldn&#39;t look beyond Gordon. In the face of such uncertainty, he refused to buckle.  Play media    With a medal around his neck and his children at his feet, Gordon represented the most heart-warming image. At one point in the celebrations Gordon was joined by Kris Commons, another of Celtic&#39;s true go-to men. You think back now to all the uncertainty about his future in January and you wonder what madness befell the club at the time.    Commons scored the goal that unlocked this Cup final and nobody should have been too surprised about that. Hampden, after all, is his footballing home from home.    He scored there against Rangers in the League Cup semi-final last month, he scored two in the Scottish Cup semi-final in 2013, scored again in the League Cup semi-final of 2011 and scored once more in the Scottish Cup semi-final of the same year.    Commons scores. In all bar one fruitless season, that has been the way of things. He now has 11 goals this campaign to go with the 31 he got last season, the 19 he got the year before and the 14 he got in his first half-season at the club in 2011.    Balance the goals, not to mention the assists, against the price tag - about &pound;300,000 - and you are talking about one of the shrewdest signings in Celtic&#39;s modern history.    In all the joy of Deila&#39;s first trophy, it was hard to take your eyes off the one who stayed and the one who saved.  <font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font><br><br></font><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font><br><br></font></font></div>
