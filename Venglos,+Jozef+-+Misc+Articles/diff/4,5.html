Olsen had come to the end of a nine-year   stint as Norway boss, where he had won many admirers as he led them to   successive World Cup appearances and, at one point, second place in  the  Fifa rankings.<br><br>Reports at the time linked the Norwegian with  the  Parkhead vacancy, even going so far as to say that &ldquo;Drillo&rdquo; had  lined up  Finnish defender Toni Tervonin as his first signing.<br><br>In  an  interview with Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet, Olsen has confirmed  that  the rumours were true and that he had come very close to accepting  a  firm offer from Celtic. However, the manager&rsquo;s canine companion came   between him and the Hoops.<br><br>Asked if he had any regrets about   decisions he made in his coaching career, Olsen highlighted the day he   chose to knock back Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;Well, I refused to be the coach of   Celtic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Financially, I had probably been even more secure   than I am today. It is something I sometimes think was a stupid   decision.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;[Celtic would have been] exciting.It&rsquo;s a club that just wins and wins.<br><br>&ldquo;We negotiated, and I got a good offer. But then the dog stopped me.&rdquo;<br><br>Olsen   revealed that UK rules that dogs must spend three months in quarantine   before being allowed into the country gave him a difficult decision to   make. The manager&rsquo;s attachment to his dog Copier saw the man who had a   reputation for being outspoken and controversial prove that his bark  is  far worse than his bite.<br><br>&ldquo;It was Celtic or Copier. And the dog won.,&rdquo; he admitted.<br><br>Looking   back on his decision, and reservations that saw him knock back   Marseille before taking up the reins at Valerenga, Olsen conceded that   he had missed out on  the biggest opportunities of his club career.<br><br>&ldquo;You can say that no one as big as Marseille or Celtic made contact,&rdquo; he added.<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="2">   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font>  <div class="headline">  <h3>  Second opinion favours the good doctor on return visit to Glasgow</h3></div><div>  Published Date: 19 November 2000 </div>  <div class="byline">  By Andrew Smith (Scotsman newspaper)</div>  <div class="ds-firstpara">   Jozef Venglos smiles warmly as he opens up a UEFA brochure detailing  the work of the body&rsquo;s technical study group at Euro 2000. In it, the  Slovak is pictured beside such coaching luminaries as Gerard Houllier,  Rinus Michaels and Berti Vogts, underneath which are short biographies,  with each man given a title after his name.</div>The former Celtic head  coach, back in Glasgow this weekend to front a European seminar - Coach  2000 organised by sportscotland and Glasgow City Council - shares a page  with Vogts in which the German is described as The Winner, and he is  labelled simply The Gentleman. Meant, no doubt, as a compliment, it was  exactly his humane, kindly ways that left him without a name after his  troubled, 10-month stint as Celtic&rsquo;s head coach.   <br><br>Dr Venglos&rsquo;  reign at Parkhead for season 1998-99 is generally regarded as one of  unmitigated disaster. Inheriting a title-winning squad from Wim Jansen,  who left under a cloud, dismal early-season form led to the-then  62-year-old being portrayed as a man fiddling while Celtic&rsquo;s season  burned, the Slovak ridiculed over his age and words. He was shamefully  presented as a bumbling old fool whose near-four decades&rsquo; experience as a  coach did not make him cut out for the high-pressure post. &quot;Certain  writers chose to make a judgment of me I would not have been able to  change, whatever happened,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t have to  justify myself after my career.&quot; <br><br>Perhaps Venglos&rsquo; decency was  not suited to the snake-pit environment of the Old Firm, the former  Czechoslovakia manager preferring to exchange ideas within his squad  rather than impose his will on them. But whatever his suitability, or  otherwise, to take charge of a club in ferment, his methods and record  in Scotland did not warrant his character being assassinated on a daily  basis. <br><br>Venglos is entitled to be bitter, but regular returns to a  &quot;nice country with nice people&quot; indicate that this is just not in his  make-up. Indeed, the 64-year-old has relished visiting for the UEFA  seminars, and refuses to use the trip to set the record straight on the  acceptable job that he carried out in monumentally-trying circumstances.  <br><br>&quot;It was a difficult time, but it was okay,&quot; he offers, in  typically-understated fashion. &quot;I had other options, but I am glad I  came to an institution like Celtic. I had no problems with the players,  and we played some good football. We had so many players who were at the  World Cup, and it was hard for them to peak again immediately after  that. Many suffered serious injuries, which did not help. Some people  chose not take these factors into account.&quot; <br><br>This an allusion to  his would-be executioners, a body who also pay scant regard to the fact  that Venglos guided Celtic to a 21-game unbeaten run between November  and March that took the club to within a whisper of league-winners  Rangers; this sequence kicked-off with the astonishing 5-1 defeat of  Dick Advocaat&rsquo;s men. It is a result even now the Slovak will not gloat  over. &quot;We were pretty even in Old Firm games, and it was only in my last  two [the final SPL match-up and the Scottish Cup final] that we  suffered a defeat to Rangers,&quot; he says. &quot;Our problem was losing to St  Johnstone three times.&quot; <br><br>Robbed of Marc Reiper for practically  the entire season, the additional handicaps of long-term injuries to  Alan Stubbs, Craig Burley and Jackie McNamara denied him key performers  who had been the backbone of the title-winning side. Celtic, more than  the media, though, hung Venglos out to dry. Turning to him at the 11th  hour after several other candidates turned them down, the club dragged  their heels over investing in the transfer market. It was not until two  months into the season that reinforcements began to arrive in the shape  of Vidar Riseth, Lubo Moravcik and Johan Mjallby. In December, Mark  Viduka arrived, only to disappear back to Australia and, at a crucial  period, deny Venglos a striker whose market value at Leeds has soared to  &pound;14m, three times the sum that the Slovak paid for him. <br><br>That  Moravcik, whom his countryman was mocked for signing, and Mjallby remain  integral to Martin O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s plans this season proves that Venglos was  no fool. &quot;I knew it was going to be transition season, the officials at  the club had warned me of that, but I am glad I could bring some good  players. I think I can look anyone in the eye, and say my assessment of  these players was correct.&quot; <br><br>Venglos could also claim to have  kept his dignity while others lost theirs, but is too genial to do that.  High blood pressure was the reason given for him making way for John  Barnes, a selection about which he is diplomatic: &quot;The club thought they  were getting it right; they wanted it to be right.&quot; In Barnes&rsquo;  successor, O&rsquo;Neill, Venglos feels they have got it right. &quot;He is an  intelligent, nice man with plenty of experience, who is getting a very  good response from the players and fans, which is most important.&quot; <br><br><div>This is how Venglos chooses to recall his own contribution to the Celtic cause.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&#39;IT WAS WEIRD&#39;</span></h3></div><div> Former  Celtic star Alan Stubbs says ex-boss Dr Jozef Venglos would make  players hold their breath while running around the training ground<div class="article__subdeck theme__border-color">The Slovakian took over at Parkhead after taking over from Wim Jansen in 1998 but lasted just one season </div></div><div>https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/2209303/celtic-alan-stubbs-jozef-venglos-training/</div><div>FORMER Celtic star Alan Stubbs has revealed Dr Jozef Venglos&#39; &#39;strange&#39; training methods.

He told <a class="external" href="http://www.open-goal.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Open Goal</a>: &quot;When you hear of a doctor coming in to be a manager of a football club, you think &#39;how does that work?</div><div>&quot;He was a really nice guy.

That Inter side contained Walter Zenga, Giuseppe Bergomi, Andreas Brehme, Lothar Matthaus and Jurgen Klinsmann.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">i&#39;s fantasy football tips newsletter: get ahead</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The result was heralded as the dawn of a new age of English football. Three months earlier, Villa chairman Doug Ellis had appointed Dr Jozef Venglos to replace new England manager Graham Taylor. Venglos was not the first foreign manager in England, but he was the first in the top flight. Ossie Ardiles and Danny Bergara, his two overseas - and lower-league - contemporaries, had both already immersed themselves in English football. Venglos was a total mystery.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Venglos certainly had the CV to merit the size of club, even if the appointment was left-field. His Czechoslovakia team had reached the semi-finals of the European Championship and been knocked out of World Cup &lsquo;90 by a Matthaus penalty for West Germany. But English football had only ever recruited on a distinctly insular basis. The three frontrunners for the Villa job: Gerry Francis, Arthur Cox and David Pleat. We created the game and gave it to the world. There was little to be gained from being taught to suck eggs.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Villa and Venglos were a terrible match that ended in divorce with his resignation after less than a year in charge. Villa finished 17th in Division One, a fall of 15 places from the previous season. The football was either dull or embarrassingly naive (the 3-0 second leg defeat in Milan an early example of the latter), and it took Englishman Ron &lsquo;Mr Personality&rsquo; Atkinson to haul Villa back to their expected level.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But it would be remiss not to mention the mitigating circumstances. Arsene Wenger is credited with shifting the mindset of English football and English footballers in the mid-1990s, but Venglos attempted the same trick half a decade before him. He extolled the power of warm-ups and warm-downs, tried to ward Villa&rsquo;s players away from steak, chips and beer with his research into the value of healthy nutrition and at least initially attempted to implement a continental passing style.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But Venglos arrived at the fight for revolution holding a rusty spoon. While Wenger was able to sign 11 players from foreign clubs in his first 18 months, an army of disciples to convince the existing squad of the need for systemic lifestyle changes, Venglos inherited new signing Tony Cascarino and recruited only one player in his first summer. Ivo Stas would never play a game for the club, his career ruined by achilles injuries.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Arsene Wenger was able to sign European talents like Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars shortly after he joined Arsenal (Getty Images)</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Arsene Wenger was able to sign European talents like Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars shortly after he joined Arsenal (Getty Images)</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He also succeeded an incredibly popular manager. Arsenal&rsquo;s underperformance under Bruce Rioch and Stewart Houston gave Wenger a mandate for change, but Villa had finished second in the league under the immensely popular Taylor. The squad - understandably - saw little need to fix a way of life that wasn&rsquo;t broken. Villa was not ripe for revolution, and chairman Ellis should have foreseen as much. Put simply, some of the players thought that Venglos was a crackpot.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Nor too was English football ready for Venglos&rsquo; kind. The press had made up its mind en masse after preseason (and were proven correct). Italia &lsquo;90 had certainly opened English eyes to the wide footballing world beyond our coastline, but we still believed that we knew best. That mistrust of outsiders still permeates our culture (to its detriment) 30 years on.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But dreams can only be sold if they are founded upon realism. Purely being a visionary isn&rsquo;t enough, and should not absolve Venglos of blame. He discussed the merits of passing football in autumn but by spring had virtually abandoned his principles by playing direct football that often launched the ball to Cascarino. He spent &pound;1m on forward Gary Penrice, who scored one league goal for the club. He replaced assistant manager John Ward with former player Peter Withe and then embarked upon an all-out-attack strategy that fell down because Villa couldn&rsquo;t create sufficient chances and were hopeless defensively.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Read More</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Lily Parr: The chain-smoking, sweary striker who made women&#39;s football so successful they banned it</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Ultimately, then, Venglos&rsquo; legacy is questionable. It is certainly true that he attempted to implement the same principles that Wenger did so majestically at Arsenal, but Wenger is remembered more fondly purely because he was so successful at both delivering the message and converting it into results. The means are only justified if the end is satisfactory.</span><br><br><div><span class="diffAdd">Venglos&rsquo; failure also directly hampered those who might otherwise have stood on his shoulders. English football belatedly accepted its cultural awakening during the early 1990s, fuelled by Eric Cantona, Ruud Gullit, Jurgen Klinsmann and Dennis Bergkamp, but it would take until October 1996 for another top-flight club to appoint a manager from outside England. It was Wenger, and not Venglos, who convinced the Premier League that the European model of coaching was something to be embraced rather than ignored. </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span></div><div></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span></div><div></div><span class="diffAdd">  </span></div>
