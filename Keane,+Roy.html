He loved the club and their fans loved him even more for his uncompromising and martyr-like devotion to winning, but slagging your team mates off publicly in no uncertain terms is not going to win you popularity contests amongst your colleagues, so he left/got pushed/chucked out/walked out (delete as you think appropriate). His manager Alex Ferguson rated him as irreplaceable, but now had to do without him.<br><br>With various clubs after him, few would have begrudged him moving to Real Madrid for a big fat retirement cheque, but he didn&rsquo;t go there, he came to Celtic. Counter to popular belief, there is little evidence that he was some died-in-the-wool Celtic fan as a boy, but reports said he was a big Spurs fan.<br><br>Nevertheless, during his time at Man U, he visited Celtic Park to watch Celtic a number of times and fell in love with the club, and noted in his biography that he wished to play for us before the end of his career.<br><br><blockquote><i>&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t have called it a dream but I&rsquo;d always liked Celtic. And the  Irish connection would have been on the back of my mind. I felt a bit of  loyalty to them. This decision was a purely selfish one. I just wanted  to play for Glasgo</i><i>w Celtic. Celtic is a special club.&rdquo;</i> (Roy Keane Biog 2014)<br></blockquote><br>Arguments on the Celtic online forums raged over whether Celtic should take him or not, some arguing he was too old or that he was tainted due to his vicious tackle on another player in a match which broke that man&#39;s leg. Others said he was a great player and would pass on great coaching to our youngsters and so on.The last word was always going to be Gordon Strachan&rsquo;s and he brought Keane to Paradise, although it doesn&#39;t appear that Strachan was really going for him. <br><br>His Celtic career started surprisingly in the more spartan surroundings of playing Clyde at Broadwood in the Scottish Cup, where we duly lost 2-1 to the lower tier side. Embarrassing start but he was hardly at fault in any way. The team performed shockingly poorly on the day and got what they deserved.<br><br>In a later released autobiography (2014) he stated on that first game (written by a ghost author taking liberties):<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;My first game [for Celtic] was Clyde, away, in the third round of the Scottish Cup. We were beaten 2-1. It was a nightmare. I wasn&rsquo;t happy with my own game. I did OK, but OK wasn&rsquo;t good enough. After the game &ndash; the disappointment. As I was taking my jersey off, I noticed the Nike tag was still on it. When I got on the bus John Hartson, a really good guy, was already sitting there and he was eating a packet of crisps &ndash; with a fizzy drink. I said to myself: &lsquo;Welcome to Hell.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br></i></blockquote><br>Anyhow, the rest of his short career at Celtic was a vast improvement, with no repeats of that sorry debacle and he enjoyed the experience. Sadly his time was punctured by injuries although he still gathered enough appearances to win a League title medal. He played a role in the League Cup win v Dunfermline but had to come off injured which was his last appearance for the club. <br><br>To his critics&#39; dismay, he handled his single Celtic v Rangers game very well (remaining unbeaten) playing in the 1-0 win at Ibrox and got involved in his normal physical manner, getting a yellow card for his troubles (which I&rsquo;m sure he will treasure for the rest of his life). It was the sort of game Keane would have wanted to play in and he played well for Celtic in his part in this game. Roy Keane put in the sort of performance he was renowned for at his peak never giving Barry Ferguson or the Rangers midfield a look in - a tremendous display without any shadow of a doubt <br><br>After much consideration, he admitted that he couldn&rsquo;t carry on his career. Injuries were too much for his overworked body to be able to handle anymore, and he announced time up on his career having won over every Celtic fan for his dedication through his short time (except Billy McNeil for some reason). He admitted to generally keeping to himself whilst at Celtic, preferring not to get close to the others but did admit he liked that there were no egos amongst his team-mates as like at Man Utd. <br><h3>  </h3><br>Overall he gave as good as he could in his limited time at the club. His old manager at Man U, Alex Ferguson, later reflected that Roy loved it at Celtic and respected his time at the club. Problem is that he was at the twilight of his career and the fire wasn&#39;t there as it once was.<br><br>His final game was his testimonial at Old Trafford, which was an emotional occasion for him, even breaking a rare smile on the pitch. He played the first 45mins with Celtic and the second 45 with Man U in the 2-0 victory for the home side bringing down a curtain on a glorious and controversial career.<br><br>As a slight aside it was astonishing (okay it wasn&#39;t really) that a few weeks prior to Roy Keane&#39;s Testimonial the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester had point blank refused permission to allow Bolton to play a friendly against Rangers due to the Rangers&#39; fans&#39; reputation and yet 35,000 Celtic Supporters were allowed to travel to Old Trafford for Keane&#39;s game and were subsequently praised by the very same Chief Constable for their excellent and exemplary behaviour<br><br>There was a lot of pride in seeing Roy Keane play for Celtic, and there were displays made specially for him (e.g. Irish Tricolour card displays and the like).<br><br>Football will unlikely see many more gladiatorial figures than him in its history, and Celtic can be thankful to have been able to count him as one of its sons. <br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>He&#39;d had a poor run in managing sides after hanging up his boots, with failed tenures at Sunderland and Ipswich. After castigating fellow players for turning to match commentary &amp; analysis, ironically he gave it all a go with some straight-forward talk. Being on the front football was where he heart lay, but he needed the right offer. He was supposedly offered the Celtic manager&#39;s role in 2014 but he turned it down saying Celtic weren&#39;t trying hard enough and so he opted to remain in his co-manager role with the Rep of Ireland. Likely he was only shown the role with enquiries to his interest, but many commentators believed Celtic dodged a bullet on this one preferring Ronny Deila instead but Ronny Deila himself turned out to be another failed move.<br><br>His management &amp; assistant roles all ultimately failed, including working beside ex-Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill at Nottingham Forrest having previously done a similar role for Rep of Ireland also with Martin O&#39;Neill. <br><br>[....]<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>Quotes</h3><h3>  <img align="right" alt="Roy Keane - Kerrydale Street" height="215" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/wiki/kds/image/1SGmjgpxKv$bWEEqSKgc08w==41826/GW156H215" title="Roy Keane - Kerrydale Street" width="156"></h3>Keane&rsquo;s departure [from Man U] was inevitable and he signed for boyhood favourites Celtic but Ferguson soon knew his career was on the wane.<br>He  said: &ldquo;The dressing room relaxed when Roy left. Relief swept the room.  They no longer had to listen to the barrage that some of them had grown  to expect. Because he&rsquo;d been a declining force, the gap he left was not  as big as it would have been three years previously.<br>&ldquo;I watched him in a Celtic-Rangers game and said to Carlos Queiroz beforehand, &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be the star man today&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;Roy was never in the game. He played a passive role. The dynamic, fist-clenching, demanding Roy Keane wasn&rsquo;t there.<br>&ldquo;He  loved it at Celtic Park. I spoke to him about it and he praised the  training, the facilities, the Prozone. Things did settle down between  us.<br>&ldquo;About two months later I was sitting in my office discussing  team business with Carlos when a member of staff called to say Roy was  here to see me. I was startled.<br>&ldquo;He said, &lsquo;I want to apologise to  you for my behaviour&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s when he began describing the scene at  Celtic and telling me how well his work was going. But when I saw him in  that Rangers-Celtic game I knew he wouldn&rsquo;t carry on with it.&rdquo;<br><b>Alex Ferguson (Man U manager) on his former player Roy Keane (from his biography 2013)<br></b><br>&quot;You obviously don&rsquo;t know Martin [O&#39;Neil] as well as you think you do. He makes me look like Mother Theresa.&rdquo;<b><br>Ex-Celtic player Roy Keane on ex-Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neil (Roy Keane is assistant to MoN who is the manager of Rep of Ireland, but Keane never played under MoN at Celtic) (2013)</b><br><br>&quot;I wouldn&rsquo;t have called it a dream but I&rsquo;d always liked Celtic.

<tr>  <td>  New Celtic signing Roy Keane has spoken for the first time about his move to Parkhead.<br><br>Keane signed his deal on Thursday which will take him to 2007 and he is really looking forward to beginning his life as a Celtic player. <br><br>&quot;It is a great move fore me, I have taken my time but everything is now done - it is a good day,&quot; Keane explained, &quot;I am looking forward to the challenge.&quot;<br><br>He explained that he had talked with a number of interested parties since his depature from Manchester United last month and that included Spanish giants Real Madrid.<br><br>&quot;There has been a lot of speculation in the last few weeks and I have spoken to a lot of clubs,&quot; he confirmed. <br><br>&quot;I spoke to Madrid on Tuesday and they told me it may be another week away, but as I said I gave every club a chance and having spoken to the manager I felt this was the club for me and I gave the go ahead yesterday morning. <br><br>&quot;Walking around the club I feel comfortable and think this is where I belong.&quot; <br><br>Keane insisted the pressure at Celtic would be just as intense as it was at Old Trafford. <br><br>&quot;They are both massive clubs and that is the challenge, there is pressure to win football matches - that is a pressure I enjoy,&quot; he opined. <br><br>&quot;I wanted a new challenge, different environment and staff. <br><br>&quot;I spoke to one or two Premiership managers, but as Is said I thought this was the best move for me. <br><br>&quot;I have been here a few times and I have always enjoyed watching them and they are seeking to improve and want to do well in Europe and I have come up here to win football matches and help the squad. <br><br>&quot;I feel I can help the club move on to the next level and win trophies, I am not in the game to be popular. <br><br>&quot;You always need a big squad and the players who are at Celtic have done well, I am under no illusions I will come here and walk into the team, I want to train hard and give the manager a problem.&quot; <br><br>Keane admitted he wanted to quit English football. <br><br>&quot;I have proved myself in The Premiership and now was right for a new challenge,&quot; he said. <br><br>&quot;It would have been easy for me to stay in England, but this was a challenge I wanted. <br><br>&quot;I thought it was right I spoke to a few clubs and I thought it was a good idea, but it turned out I like most of them and could have played for any of them. <br><br>&quot;I spoke with Bryan Robson and he is a player I have great respect for but you can&#39;t please everybody - this decision was for me. <br><br>&quot;I have speaking to four or five clubs over the last few weeks and Michael was speaking to Madrid last week, but I said it was important I spoke to somebody and I talked with Mr Butragueno [Emilio, Real&#39;s sporting director] last week but they said they couldn&#39;t make a decision until next week - and I think I had to be fair to the other clubs and I wasn&#39;t prepared to wait another week. <br><br>&quot;Over the weekend I decided it had to be Monday or Tuesday and I don&#39;t doubt I have made the right decision.&quot; <br><br>Keane quipped about his future relationship with his new team-mates. <br><br>&quot;I am sure they will love me,&quot; he joked, &quot;I like to work hard and I would never ask a team-mate to do something I wouldn&#39;t. <br><br>&quot;I know the fans will judge me on what I do on the football pitch. I am all about the team and that comes first, the captaincy doesn&#39;t bother me one bit. <br><br>&quot;I hope the fans are happy, I know I am. I am not looking to unwind, I am here for a new challenge. <br><br>&quot;People think I am 94, but I am not I am 34. <br><br>&quot;I am hoping to surprise a few people, the role I had at United was important - sitting in front of the back four and I might get more licence to go forward up here. <br><br>&quot;I am here to win matches and trophies - there is no other reason to play.&quot; <br><br>Keane feels Celtic will probably be his last club, adding: &quot;I would have thought so, the contract is for the season and next and for football you cant get ahead of yourself.&quot; <br><br>The Irish legend insists that a coaching role was not something he was looking at. <br><br>&quot;Coaching is further down the road for me,&quot; he said. <br><br>&quot;You have to be focussed on your playing at this level and that is a long way down the line for me hopefully.&quot; <br><br>Keane did not speak too much about United but stressed that he and Sir Alex Ferguson parted on good terms. <br><br>&quot;I was very lucky and the manager was great,&quot; he revealed. <br><br>&quot;It was very amicable and we shook hands and wished each other well and I wish everyone at United well.<br><br>&quot;I had been convinced I would finish my career at United, up until last year - but things change in football.&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>Keane: &lsquo;Thought it would be easier at Celtic&rsquo;</h3>Real Madrid were interested and with hindsight that&rsquo;s where I should have headed for<br>http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/keane-thought-it-would-be-easier-at-celtic-1.1957912?page=1<br><br>Thu, Oct 9, 2014, 17:16<br><br>Roy Keane on his options once he knew his career at Old Trafford was over.<br><br>Real Madrid offered me a year and a half deal. Everton wanted me to go to them. Bolton, too, who were also on my doorstep. I met Sam Allardyce. But I went to Celtic for fifteen grand a week basic. It was a massive pay cut.<br><br>I met Gordon Strachan who told me: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not really too worried if you sign for us or mot. We&rsquo;re okay without you. So I said to myself: &ldquo;**** him, I&rsquo;m signing.&rdquo;<br><br>Michael (Kennedy, my agent) had been over to Madrid and he&rsquo;d negotiated a deal with Real. Michael had given me a heads-up that Butragueno would be phoning so I took my mobile everywhere with me. And, how&rsquo;s my luck, he rang me when I was sitting on the toilet.<br><br>I should have appreciated Real&rsquo;s offer more. With hindsight I should have said to myself &ldquo;Go. Go to Spain, &rdquo; live there for a year and a half, learn the language, learn the culture.<br><br>The weather and training might have given me another lease of life, two years of playing. But instead &ndash; as usual &ndash; I was looking at what might go wrong. &ldquo;Hindsight&rdquo; is a ****** of a word.<br><br>I didn&rsquo;t want to move to Spain. As much as anything else, it was fear that decided it for me; fear of the unknown. I thought I could make a bigger impact at Celtic than I would have at Everton or Madrid. To be honest, I thought it be a bit easier at Celtic.<br><br>Actually, it wasn&rsquo;t really about which club I should go to. The fact is, the morning I left United I lost the love for the game a little bit.<br><br>Don&rsquo;t go to Celtic<br><br>Michael Kennedy begged me not to sign for Celtic. He wasn&rsquo;t happy with the negotiations or their, &lsquo;take it or leave it,&rsquo; approach. But I still think that if I had not signed for Celtic then I would have regretted it.<br><br>They&rsquo;d offered me the least money of any of the clubs. I read somewhere that I went to Celtic for forty or fifty thousand a week but it was fifteen basic that they offered me.<br><br>I wasn&rsquo;t motivated by the money, or just the money, I think there might have been a bit of guilt about that, when I left United, the amount I&rsquo;d been earning there and earning so much for something I loved doing anyway.<br><br>I&rsquo;d said in interviews over the years &lsquo;I&rsquo;d like to play for Celtic one day&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d said it casually but now I felt I could not go back on my word.<br><br>And I wanted to play against Rangers in an Old Firm game. For the atmosphere, the buzz, the experience.<br><br>But more than any other consideration, I just thought, &lsquo;I want to treat myself here, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to go where I want to go and **** the money&rsquo;.<br><br>I wouldn&rsquo;t have called it a dream but I&rsquo;d always liked Celtic. And the Irish connection would have been on the back of my mind. I felt a bit of loyalty to them. This decision was a purely selfish one. I just wanted to play for Glasgow Celtic. Celtic is a special club.&rdquo;<br><br>First day after training at Celtic.<br><br>My hip was ******&rsquo; screaming from the warm-up. Not aching, screaming. I couldn&rsquo;t budge. I thought to myself: &ldquo;You should have retired. You should have packed it in.&rdquo; Sometimes you have to be courageous enough to say no. No, is a sentence. Less than a year ago, I&rsquo;d been in the Highbury tunnel, imposing myself on the game before it started. Now I was lying on a hotel bed wondering if I could get through training.<br><br>&ldquo;My first Old Firm game was at Ibrox and we won 1-0. It was brilliant. The atmosphere was brilliant, ******&rsquo; electric. The hatred, I enjoyed all that. I got a yellow card for a foul on Prso and they were baying fora red card.<br><br>I was man of the match and that was a little moment of satisfation, another tiny victory. But at this stage I was taking painkillers before every match. An injection in the bum; Diclofenac or Voltarol. The cause of the pain was a labral tear of the hip and I understood that playing on could worsen the tear.<br><br>I was taking an injection before the game and at half time just to get through. And you do get through but I&rsquo;d be in bits. I could justify the painkillers for the Rangers&rsquo; game but now I was taking them for every game. That was when I thought &lsquo;this is not good&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been taking them in England but only for the big games - Arsenal, City - when I knew I&rsquo;d physically have to be at my best. Now, common sense was telling me that my days were numbered.<br><br>We beat Hearts at Celtic Park in early April and won the league title. I was injured that day. It was hard to to join in the celebrations. I had not played enough. I won League and the League Cupmedals with Celtic but I never really contributed. I look back at my time there and and I&rsquo;m a bit embarrassed by it.<br><br>Why didn&rsquo;t I go to Everton? I would have regretted not going to Celtic. I liked David Moyes and the chairman Bill Kenwright was very good with Michael Kennedy during the negotiaitons. They had offered me a lot more than Celtic.<br><br>But I think I would have found it hard playing for another English team. Which is stupid. Everton might have given me a new lease of life, I might have had two or three more years there.The system they played would have suited me. I would have been a proper sitting midfielder.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/kds/widget/genericvideo/a6f6d3ff1645f88fb39cb74c4a418df017ee5343" width="420"></iframe></h3><br>  <img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1081" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/f348410ffe9fac730058bbe73aaf6b9a/GW829H1081" title="from Neg Sludden" width="829"><br><br><br></div></div>
