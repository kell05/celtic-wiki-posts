What better way was there than to make our mark than in the upcoming Empire Exhibition tournament.<span class="diffRemove">   </span><br><br></font><div align="center">  </div><font color="#000000">The Empire Exhibition Tournament was played in the pre-war summer of 1938 to mark the Empire Exhibition, being held in Bellahouston Park in Glasgow. Eight teams took part in the tournament held at Ibrox - Aberdeen, Celtic, Hearts, Rangers represented Scotland and Brentford, Chelsea, Everton and Sunderland (Champions of England) for England.   </font><font color="#000000"><br><br>Celtic had already won the Scottish League Championship (for the second time in three years) and winning this cup would be a fine bonus to celebrate a 50 years milestone in the club&#39;s proud history. <br><br>Celtic legend Jimmy McGrory, finally giving in to years of abuse, retired at the age of 33 and the Park&#39;s record attendance of 92,000 was set versus Rangers in a 3-0 victory on New Year&#39;s day 1938. Celtic played Sunderland in the first round and won a replay 3-1 after a 0-0 draw in the first match. <br><br>Hearts were disposed of in the semi-final 1-0 through a Johnny Crum goal. Everton, destined to win the English championship in the following season, were Celtic&#39;s opponents in the final. They had beaten Rangers 2-0 and Aberdeen 3-2 to advance to the final and were the favourites to triumph. </font><br><br><h3>  The Final</h3>Celtic and its support represented everything the people behind the exhibition despised. How it must have then riled them to see the Bhoys reach the final of a competition celebrating the British Empire.   <br><font color="#000000"><br>The game itself saw a crowd of 82,000 packed into Ibrox who were to witness an enthralling and tense 90 minutes. The football on display was excellent and the game swung from end to end providing much more entertainment than the 0-0 scoreline suggests.<br><br>Everton were a side packed with internationals and would go on to win England&rsquo;s championship. But they had met their match in a wonderful Celtic side inspired ably by James Delaney.<br><br>Extra-time would decide the victor and with Celtic taking a firm control of the game Johnny Crum hit home the only goal of the game to claim the prize for the Bhoys.<br><br>The cry at the end was: &quot;Fetch a polis man! Everton&#39;s gettin murdered!&quot;<br><br>Crum danced a jig of joy behind the net and at full-time the Celtic support celebrated a wonderful triumph with rousing choruses of patriotic Irish ballads such as Dear Little Shamrock.<br><br>The vital goal by Crum 5 minutes into extra time won Celtic the match and the tournament. <br><br>The trophy, to be kept permanently by the winning club, was a silver replica of the Exhibition Tower.<br><br>Celtic received a total of &pound;2591 for the four matches they played.<br><br>The victory was wonderful for Celtic in many ways. To be the victors in the backyard of their rivals, to have won a tournament celebrating the British Empire and to have beaten the best in Britain will have not gone unnoticed by the establishment members. In its own way, it was a poke in the eye to the old guard in Britain, and in its own way was a means of pride to the Irish communities throughout the UK and Ireland as well.

Celtic, however, had the greater versatility and a bigger range of tactics. <br><br>The winners&#39; right wing, despite the return of Delaney, did not work too well but Crum was a perpetual danger to the Everton goal, which had the majority of escapes. In defence, Lyon was in grand fettle, even with the task of holding Lawton, the Liverpool club&#39;s youthful and burly centre-forward, who excelled with his headwork. <br><br><font size="4"><b><font size="2">STEVENSON&#39;S BRILLIANT PATCHES</font> </b></font><br><br>Everton did well up to a point, but were easily countered, particularly when they failed on the wings. Their half-backs fulfilled the primary purpose of linking the defence and attack, but lacked the individual enterprise which characterised every Celt when the opportunity arose. <br><br>Geldard got most opportunities, yet was mastered by Morrison. A bright feature in a hard game was the occasional spurts of brilliance by Stevenson, the ex-Ranger and Irish international player, but his patches of brilliance were marred by periods of indecision, as was the display of Sagar in goal. <br><br>Celtic&#39;s cup-fighting tradition has been seen throughout the tournament, and although failing to hold the Scottish Cup in the past season, they will have a new and permanent trophy to decorate a table at their jubilee celebrations next week. <br><br><font size="4"><b><font size="2">TURN-ABOUT PLAY</font> </b></font><br><br>Celtic, starting against the wind, were hard pressed for a spell, but Lawton&#39;s jousts with Kennaway were unproductive, and a series of free kicks gave Celtic a grip on the game, Divers being particularly prominent. <br><br>Some of Celtic&#39;s failings might have been due to the fact that they were also facing the sun. In defence however, they never wavered, until Paterson brought down Geldard and the ensuing play allowed even Cook to have a shot. Yet it was quick, turn-about play, and Sagar again got into trouble by leaving his goal for a hasty, punched clearance. Divers was hurt in this scrimmage, and was off for a short spell; nevertheless, Sagar had to deal with shots from Lyon and Paterson. <br><br>Celtic reopened briskly, and found the Everton defenders puzzled in the face of the sun. Wide passing took the Parkhead men in on Sagar with a regularity that confused the full backs. All that was required was a finishing shot. Crum&rsquo;s persistence, however, led to Sagar being beaten for possession, and the ball going against the post. <br><br>Everton rallied, and Kennaway did well to clear good crosses from both wingers with the bustling Lawton in close attendance. In fact, deliberation by Boyes possibly lost Everton their first real chance. <br><br>Celtic got over that and Divers got the ball into the net, only to be whistled offside. For a while only Lawton&#39;s clever leading prevented Everton being hemmed in altogether, while weight and vigour kept Crum and Delaney at bay till full time. <br><br><b><font size="2">SAGAR JUST FAILS</font></b><br><br>Celtic had the worse of the early stages-of the extra time. After ten minutes, McDonald burst through to give Crum a difficult pass that the centre hooked to the net. Sagar just failing to hold a hard
