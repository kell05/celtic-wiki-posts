By January 2006 he had yet to make his debut for the club&#39;s first team, so in order for him to gain competitive experience he was loaned out to fellow SPL side Dundee United for the remainder of the 2005/06 season.<br><br>A successful spell at Tannadice saw him feature regularly, scoring 2 goals (both free kicks) in 14 appearances and being named SPL Young Player of the Month for February. He then returned to Celtic hoping to force his way into first team contention, but was transferred to Wolverhampton Wanderers shortly thereafter without ever appearing for the Bhoys.<br><br>Mulgrew joined Wolves in part exchange for left back Lee Naylor on August 23, 2006. He made his debut for the club on September 10, 2006, in a 1-0 win at Leeds United. However, injury kept him out of most of the campaign and he was unable to force his way back into first team contention afterwards.<br><br>He was loaned out to League One side Southend United at the end of the January transfer window for the remainder of the 2007/08 season, which saw the club lose in the play-offs to Doncaster. He scored his first goal for the club against Carlisle United, although Captain Adam Barrett claims he got a touch.<br><br>At the start of the 2008/2009 season he transferred on a free to Aberdeen and found a good deal of success with the Dons during his 2 year stint there. However he was not forgotten by the coaching staff at Celtic, and his Celtic time was to have a second life.<br><b><br></b><b>Second Stint<br></b>After a successful spell for Aberdeen, newly appointed manager Neil Lennon made Charlie Mulgrew the first new signing (sic!) for Celtic of his managerial reign.<br><br>Said to have left Aberdeen in difficult circumstances after being jeered and harassed by some of their fans for having said that he &quot;doesn&#39;t give a **** about Aberdeen&quot;, although this is likely apocryphal, and there is no evidence he said it. From his behaviour it does not seem characteristic of him.<br><br>Initially deployed as a left back, Mulgrew suffered a torrid start to his second spell at Celtic and soon lost his place with Neil Lennon first preferring to play <a href="/page/Ledley%2C+Joe" target="_self">Joe Ledley </a>out of position at left back before <a href="/page/Izaguirre%2C+Emilio" target="_self">Emilio Izaguirre</a> was signed and made the left back slot his own with a series of swash buckling performances. For the rest of 2010 Mulgrew was limited to reserve team action and providing cover from the bench. 2011 started much brighter for Mulgrew, a combination of injuries and international call-ups (2011 Asian Cup), along with a desire from the manager to make the team much more solid, meant that Mulgrew made an unexpected start on the left hand side of midfield for the 2 January trip to Ibrox. Mulgrew put in a solid performance as Celtic ran out <a href="/page/2011-01-02%3A+Rangers+0-2+Celtic%2C+SPL" target="_self">2-0 winners</a>.<br><br>Further injuries to the established centre back pairing of <a href="/page/Majstorovic%2C+Daniel" target="_self">Majstorovic</a> and <a href="/page/Rogne%2C+Thomas" target="_self">Rogne</a> during January and February 2011 meant Mulgrew was pressed into action as an emergency centre back. Mulgrew seized this opportunity with both hands turning in a series of assured performances, particularly being dominant in the air and providing excellent distribution from the back. Time would tell if this was a brief cameo during a purple patch of form, or was a sign something more to come. However at the very least Mulgrew had shown that he was a valuable squad player able to provide cover in a number of positions. Mulgrew rounded out the 2010/11 season as a first choice central defender, and capped his breakthrough with the final goal in in the 3 - 0 Scottish Cup Final victory over Motherwell.<br><br>As a measure of his increased confidence and ability, he was not  afraid of taking a chance at goal, and against Dunfermline he scored a  screamer of a long-range shot from well outside the box that left the  goal keeper flapping in his wake (22 Feb 2012). If he was a higher  profile player, the goal would have been shown repeatedly worldwide via  every forum.<br><br>However, there was more and his ability througout  the whole 2011/12 season made him a firm favourite. This was no easy  season with chopping and changing throughout the team every game, and  Mulgrew himself being shifted between left-back, central defence and  defensive midfield, but he played his part and did chip in withsome excellent cracking goals. The title winning match v Kilmanrock (6-0 win on 7 Apr  2012) was the Charlie Mulgrew show as he scored two and set up two  others, and all the goals were excellent with great crosses. The only  reason he wasn&#39;t involved in the other two goals was because he was  subbed off by the time they happened. The crowd was in awe of this man.<br><br>Season 2011/12 season was the dream season for him. Celtic finally regained the league title, and Mulgrew was a core player in the side. Many highlights for him that season, but the greatest moment was a diving header against Rangers from a corner in a 3-0 victory in the last ever match against them which set things off nicely. A red card in a 4-2 defeat to Rangers early in the season was the only blip, but he more than made up for that. A good haul of goals and a mainstay in the squad, really highlighed his worth. That season he went onto win many personal honours including clean sweeps in player of the year awards. He really was on top of the world.<br><br>The 2012/13 saw the thankful loss of the now liquidated Rangers, and domestic dominance was sealed with a confident league title. For Mulgrew and all the biggest tests were in the Champions League, and in the classic match v Barcelona at home, Mulgrew like many others in the side played out of his sock in the incredible 2-1 victory. It was his excellent corner that connected with Wanyama&#39;s head to create the first goal that set things going. Others were more greatly heralded, but Mulgrew as a central player in the side that day must be given his due. Another great highlight was scoring the winner for Scotland against Estonia in a qualifer. He had now achieved all he could have dreamed possible for himself in football.<br><br>Inevitably, things were to turn. His form did begin to slip in the following season, but this was in line with many other Celtic players of the time. Lennon had hit a glass ceiling in his managerial ability at Celtic, and this meant players&#39; form were to regress. Still we won the league title but in Europe and at home, it wasn&#39;t great. Mulgrew was to begin getting flak too, mainly as his performances weren&#39;t impressing as they once were. His pace was declining and his judgement slipping.<br><br>Charlie had in some ways become a bit taken for granted. He may not have had the panache of many old greats, but he did his job with no issues or questions despite any preferences for playing in other roles. Whether in defence or midfield he gave his all in every game, and was a valuable player. <br><br>What was most important was that on his day he could be a good player who relied on heart, something every successful team needs. He may not have had the talent or skill like some of his peers, yet he was highly resourceful in practise for the first team. Mulgrew knew that Celtic was the biggest stage he&#39;d likely achieve in his career and he was grasping the blessed second chance he&#39;d been given with both hands. <br><br>Didn&#39;t stop him being an easy target for online moaners, but he just carried on and in fairness, he was playing to the best of his abilities and playing in the roles asked of him. Sometimes he was used in midfield, other times in make shift roles in the defence. In some ways,the coaches seemed to not know how to utilise him best as his form declined.<br><br>What became comical was having once been seen as the boo bhoy from the terraces now on the pitch.He had also acquired some glam style hairdo which made him a butt of jokes for some. No big deal, he had the income to do so, so why not? But then again it looked very camp and silly.<br><br>In some ways, he personified Lennon&#39;s time at Celtic. When the team was on a high so was he, but as things declined then so did he (and it was to be a vicious circle). He punched above his weight despite early misgivings ahead of his second time at Celtic and a very shakey start. Some of the highs led to plaudits beyond anything that could have been ever expected. For that he should be respected. <br><br>Things were to start stepping down under Deila, and by this stage he was a veteran of the first team.<br><br>Season 2014-15 became a hindrance after injury ruled him out for a long stretch. With performing and upcoming midfielders in the squad in Biton and Johansen amongst others, competition was strong and the emphasis was changing under Deila. In effect, Mulgrew was no longer a first choice despite any past popularity and it was clear it was time to accept the relegated status as a squad player rather than first team pick. <br><br>The nadir for Charlie was August 2015. Izaguirre had been having a rough start, and for the vital match v Malmo in the Champions League qualifiers, Mulgrew was preferred. It was a gamble but failed miserably. He lacked pace and was targeted as Celtic were to be ignominiously dumped out the competition. Didn&#39;t help that he wasn&#39;t given a set position which meant he was multi-tasking but not mastering a single role.<br><br>He still played as a filler in a number of games across his final seasons, but his best attributes were long gone. The defeat to Sevco in the Scottish Cup in 2016 showed he was not providing any additional drive to the side, but he still gave his all. He was in some ways becoming unintentionally a liability, but the coaches were at fault for this too, shoe-horning in Mulgrew when their plans weren&#39;t working so leading to Mulgrew taking the flak. Didn&#39;t stop the repetitive over the top criticism by a perma raged online minority, who can best be ignored.   <br><br>Little used and now very much at the back of the queue for first team places, Mulgrew left Celtic on a free for struggling Blackburn in 2016. Incredible to realise it but Mulgrew had been on the books at Celtic for around ten years in total over his two spells, and he not only has great memories from his time but he has very much played his part in creating them too.<br><br>He will in retrospect be remembered fondly, and there are many good highlights to pick out from on his time at Celtic.<br><div></div><div><b><br>Post-Celtic</b></div><div><br>[...add his professionalism and becoming probably one of the first vegans in football which around 2018 became quite a popular new diet

By Adithya Ananth (www.goal.com)1 July 2010   <br>Celtic have signed full-back Charlie Mulgrew on a free transfer from Aberdeen, bringing the defender back to Parkhead after four years.<br><br>The 24-year-old originally came through the Bhoys youth academy and signed a professional contract in 2002, but four years without breaking into the first-team meant that he had to be loaned out to Dundee United in 2006 to gain some experience.<br><br>A successful time at Tannadice saw Mulgrew feature on a regular basis, scoring two goals through free-kicks, which were some of his earliest exploits on his way to becoming a deadball specialist.<br><br>The versatile left-back - who can also play as a left winger - then returned to Parkhead in the hope of carving out a place in the first-team, but was instead shipped away to Wolverhampton Wanderers on a permanent transfer that was part of the deal that saw Lee Naylor move the other way.<br><br>Ironically, it is now Naylor who has left the Glaswegian giants upon expiry of his contract, with Mulgrew making a return to his boyhood club.<br><br>He has now put pen to paper on a three-year contract with the Hoops.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>  <h3>  Charlie Mulgrew caps fine season by being named Scottish Football Writers&rsquo; Association Player of the Year</h3>Charlie Mulgrew paid no heed to the adage that you should never go back &ndash; and on Wednesday his second spell at Celtic saw him scoop the accolade of Scotland&rsquo;s Player of the Year, to be presented by the Scottish Football Writers&rsquo; Association at their annual awards dinner in Glasgow a week on Sunday.   <br><br>Charlie Mulgrew caps fine season by being named Scottish Football Writers&rsquo; Association Player of the Year<br><br>By Roddy Forsyth<br>Telegraph.co.uk<br><br>Mulgrew is also contention for similar reward from PFA Scotland this Sunday and, either way, the 26 year-old has enjoyed one of the most memorable passages of his career.<br><br>When he became Neil Lennon&rsquo;s first signing as Celtic manager on July 1, 2010, Mulgrew returned to Parkhead and the club from which he had parted company two years previously, to join Aberdeen after loan spells at Dundee United, Wolves and Southend.<br><br>He scored his first goal for Celtic in the SPL at Rugby Park in October as the side recovered from an astonishing 3-0 deficit at half-time to draw 3-3 and begin the long unbeaten run which proved to be the foundation of their current title success.<br><br>As well as acquiring his first championship medal, Mulgrew cemented his place in the affections of the Hoops&rsquo; faithful with a spectacular bounced header to open the scoring against Rangers in Sunday&rsquo;s 3-0 victory in the final Old Firm derby of the season.<br><br>The chances are that he would have enjoyed nothing like these highlights had he not accepted Lennon&rsquo;s invitation to don the green and white jersey again.<br><br>&ldquo;Who knows? It&rsquo;s hard to say, but what I know is that when I went away I learned a lot and I grew up a bit,&rdquo; said Mulgrew. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t what would have happened to me if I hadn&rsquo;t left but I think the fact that I went helped me.<br><br>&ldquo;No-one said to me that I&rsquo;d taken things too lightly but when I left here I realised that everything is handed to you and when you come through as young player at Celtic, everything is easy &ndash; and you take it for granted a wee bit. Then you go away and you realise how big a club this is and how well you are treated and you appreciate it.<br><br>&ldquo;I wanted to go and make a career for myself and I had belief in my own ability that I could do well for myself, though I maybe never thought I would come back here &ndash; but it&rsquo;s happened that way and I am delighted.&rdquo;<br><br>Mulgrew&rsquo;s prominence this season has not been the consequence of his establishment in a single position. He has featured at full-back, centre back and in left midfield although, when asked for his preference, dodged the question with a gag &ndash; &ldquo;I would go in goal, you don&rsquo;t have to run about as much&rdquo; &ndash; before responding in more measured terms, while still keeping his options open.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think versatility is a hindrance. If you can play in different positions, then there are three or four chances of getting into the team. It is a good thing and it teaches you the game,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;I look back on every game and I&rsquo;m quite critical of myself. That&rsquo;s just the way I am &ndash; I can&rsquo;t help it. &ldquo;<br><br>When it was suggested that he would find nothing to fret about in the manner of his spectacular header against Rangers, Mulgrew did manage to add a caveat. &ldquo;Yes but before I got that goal, there bits and pieces I was not happy with &ndash; on the ball,&rdquo; he explained.<br><br>As for the prospect of further development in what is a comparatively young Celtic team &ndash; the average age this season has been generally just above the 23 mark &ndash; Mulgrew declared that thoughts had already turned in that direction.<br><br>&ldquo;Of course. You need to improve every season. We need to kick on again and look to make inroads in Europe - that will be the minimum requirement next year,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;We have got a great squad in there &ndash; including three guys, Izaguirre, Kayal and Commons, who didn&rsquo;t play for us a lot this year, but who will be huge for us next season &ndash; and maybe the manager will bring one or two in. It is still a young squad, with everybody in their mid-20s or younger.&rdquo;<br><br>And was that Kilmarnock game his finest moment of the season? The Mulgrew tendency to self-condemnation kicked in again when he said: &ldquo;That was good, but I came off with cramps. I didn&rsquo;t drink enough water!&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3> Charlie Mulgrew rejects &lsquo;caveman&rsquo; diet as he  becomes a vegan </h3><div class="lead-video article__lead-video"> <div class="brightcove-video"></div><font color="#0066cc"><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/charlie-mulgrew-rejects-caveman-diet-as-he-becomes-a-vegan-1-4746835" target="_self">https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/charlie-mulgrew-rejects-caveman-diet-as-he-becomes-a-vegan-1-4746835</a></font>          </div> <div class="article__meta u-clearfix"> <div class="article-meta__byline article-meta__byline--with-image"> <div class="article-meta__byline-image-container"><font color="#0066cc"><br></font></div> <div class="article-meta__byline-info-container"> <div class="article-meta__byline-name-container"><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/author/Alan.Pattullo1" target="_self"><font color="#0066cc"> </font>Alan Pattullo</a></div> <div class="article-meta__byline-contact-list"></div></div></div> <div class="article-meta__timestamp article-meta__timestamp--same-day">Wednesday 30 May 2018</div></div><br>It&rsquo;s strange to be sitting in Peru talking to Charlie Mulgrew about cooking.  Or is it? <br>The country is one of the world&rsquo;s food hot spots. Miraflores, the area of  Lima where the Scottish team is based, is viewed as South America&rsquo;s foodie  capital. Still, it&rsquo;s not common to be talking to a Scottish footballer about  turning vegan, which, to all intents, is what Mulgrew has done after noting  health scares in his family history. <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div> <br>The younger members of the Scotland squad have not quite bought into it.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re boaking when my lunch comes out,&rdquo; says Mulgrew. <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div> <br>But it&rsquo;s an important issue which Mulgrew is right to take seriously. His  father has had a heart attack and his father&rsquo;s parents both had heart attacks in  their early 70s brought on by high cholesterol levels. So what Mulgrew did not  need in his Celtic days was a dietitian recruited by Ronnie Deila telling him to  eat more meat. <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="taboola-right-rail__title"></div> <div class="taboola"></div></div> <br>&ldquo;That was the complete opposite (of what I&rsquo;m doing now). It was the caveman  diet: high fat, just meat,&rdquo; he recalls.  <br>&ldquo;My body fat was low, I was ripped. I was injured at the time so it was easy  for me to do. But when I went back training I had a lack of energy and my  cholesterol was through the roof. And I have a history of heart attacks in my  family.&rdquo; <br>His protests were met with advice to increase his meat consumption. &ldquo;The  dietitian who came in was brainwashed to think this was the way to do it,&rdquo; he  says. &ldquo;To be fair, it stripped everybody&rsquo;s fat, everybody&rsquo;s body fat was down.  But that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you are fit enough. It is hard when someone is  brainwashed to then say &lsquo;that isn&rsquo;t working for me&rsquo; because they say &lsquo;you need  to do it more&rsquo;.&rdquo; <br>When he eventually had his cholesterol checked by the club doctor, it had  doubled, hence his new outlook now. Not that he has been guided down this road  by a professional dietitian. Rather, he was influenced by documentaries on  Netflix. <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div> <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div> <br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m easily led,&rdquo; he smiles. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s basically it. I have just tried to  educate myself on eating and that sort of stuff. I&rsquo;ve felt brilliant on it. When  you&rsquo;re young you eat a kebab at three in the morning and then you train okay and  you think &lsquo;I might just keep that going&rsquo;. But you realise as you get older the  wee margins make  a difference.&rdquo;  <br>Mulgrew believes he is  fitter now than when he was 19 years old and in his  first spell with Celtic. <br>&ldquo;It is hard,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t tag myself as vegan because I might go up  there (to the hotel restaurant) and have a scoop of ice cream after my lunch!  But it&rsquo;s hard, because you need to work out how to cook. We&rsquo;re brought up  thinking meat, carbs and veg is a healthy meal. But now you need to base it all  on veg really. You need to swap chicken with sweet potato and that sort of  stuff. It&rsquo;s not easy.&rdquo; <br>Helpfully, his wife, Alana, has been swept up in it too. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s the same,  she&rsquo;s up for all that stuff,&rdquo; he reports. &ldquo;To be fair I do most of the cooking  now. She&rsquo;s learned to cook a few things as well but both of us do it. There is  still the whole chicken nuggets thing for the weans, we can&rsquo;t turn them!&rdquo; <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div> <br><div class="p402_hide"> <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div> <br>Mulgrew himself would once have turned his nose up at the mere suggestion of  a plant-based diet. But he realises that in order to prevail at a high level you  must consider treating your body with more care. Other high-performing sports  people such as F1 Lewis Hamilton and tennis sisters Serena and Venus Williams  have recently converted to a vegan diet in a bid to remain at the top for  longer. <br>Mulgrew, recently installed as captain under new Scotland manager Alex  McLeish, has every reason to want to prolong his career. As he says himself,  you&rsquo;re a long time retired. It is heartening to hear there was never any  question of him trying to avoid coming on tour to Peru and Mexico with   Scotland. <br>Now 32, he has just been promoted back to the Championship with Blackburn  Rovers, the club he joined from Celtic two years ago. The aim is to get back to  the English Premier League, where former Scotland manager Gordon Strachan, one  of his mentors, was still playing at age of 40. He was famously aided by a diet  consisting largely of bananas and seaweed. <br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an influence on me,&rdquo; says Mulgrew. &ldquo;I had good chats with him. He has  good views on keeping fit and stepping up your training rather than bringing it  down as you get older, and training how you play and that sort of stuff. I&rsquo;ve  become a big believer  in that.&rdquo; <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3><br><br></h3><br></div></div>
