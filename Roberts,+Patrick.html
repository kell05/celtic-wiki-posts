Seen as a prodigious talent, there was high regard for his natural talent but at the gilt-edged Man City financed by Middle Eastern Oligarchs, he was unlikely to win much time with that club. He was bought on strong word of mouth from fellow English sides but prematurely with a lot to learn. So Celtic was seen as a potential stepping stone to help win him some experience. <br><br>His talent felt like from another age, and he was willing to dribble the ball along the wings before cutting in for a fine chance. He had some talent. His speed and close control were exceptional, and given a run against any defence, few were able to mange to contain him, he was unplayable. Scrawny looking, but he had pace and was not afraid to take on anyone, most of whom found it impossible to tackle him easily and many feared him.<br><br>It took him a few games to get going, but a double v Hearts in April 2016 in a 3-1 victory clearly showed his burgeoning talents, and some felt he could be the man who could help manager Ronnie Deila turn things around. Ronnie Deila was having a poor second season, and was grasping at anything to help turn things around. Paddy Roberts entrance could have been the gem that Deila was looking for but it was asking a lot of the youngster, especially with the senior players in the side at a low ebb.<br><br>Paddy Roberts won plaudits early, showing off his fine skill, and an upcoming match v Sevco in the Scottish Cup was felt to be a good platform to show his worth. However, his youth &amp; inexperience was shown up in this first major test. He was to have a low profile in the match v Sevco, and missed a clear chance with Celtic to then lose on penalties at the end. He wasn&#39;t ready to lead, but had time on his side for further development. The valuation tag on his head should not be a burden to any young player.<br><br>Paddy Roberts had a few more goals to the end of the season, but was one of the few bright lights in an otherwise diminishing season with Deila already announcing his departure, although with the league title in the bag, there was something to build on.<br><br><b>2016-17 (the InVIncibles season)</b><br>With the arrival of Brendan Rodgers, things were to take a positive turn for Paddy Roberts as it did for many others.<br><br>Paddy Roberts was to be one of the stars of the show in an incredible season. His often jinking runs up the wing, taking on defenders, jinking past them with some cheeky moves; he just oozed class. He was a born entertainer, and one that made the ticket price worth just to see him. He set up goals and won penalties, but as happens he was to be targeted by the hatchet men in the opposition sides.<br><br>2016-17 was to be a dream season, and Celtic under Brendan Rodgers&#39; management went onto win the domestic treble undefeated. Not the main man in the squad, with Scott Brown, Armstrong, Dembele and Sinclair stealing the limelight, but often Paddy Roberts stole the limelight with a special darting run in a game. He was a favoured son.<br><br>One of the inevitable moments was when Celtic were to be drawn against his parent club in the European Cup, Man City. An uncomfortable proposition, but he still he put in good performances, and scored against his parent club in a 1-1 draw away which brought into the foreground in England. He also played in the 3-3 draw earlier against them (at Celtic Park), so remained unbeaten against them, and raised his profile beyond Scotland.<br><br>Paddy Roberts&#39; performances during the second half of 2016/17 came to the fore as he set up goals and took chances from all angles showed a growing confidence and maturity, and the support were simply in awe of his precocious talent. His long range efforts from outside the box clearly illustrated his accuracy and skill, and defenders were often unable to handle his runs, leading to unnecessarily conceded free kicks penalties (e.g. TheRangers&#39; Beerman on Paddy Roberts in the second 5-1 victory). Sadly meant he was targeted for some vicious tackles and fouls too, on occasion beyond accepted levels. <br><br>Problem was that despite the talent he was a loanee. To the surprise of all, James Forrest was rejuvenated under Brendan Rodgers, and as a permanent player he was given the nod often ahead of Paddy Roberts. Often they were in contention for the same role on the right wing. Sympathisers for both players could debate the positives of both players, but as time rolled on, the argument grew weaker to play Paddy Roberts.<br><br>Even without the class of Paddy Roberts, Celtic had easily won the league prematurely in 2015-16 so giving room for the manager to play who he wanted without pressure. That meant less need for Paddy Roberts, but Paddy Roberts was growing as a player and it was difficult to keep him out in season 2016/17. For James Forest frustrating but in some ways the competition helped him become a better player.<br><br>One of the humorous aspects to his stay at Celtic, was his close friendship with Kieran Tierney. Both of a similar age, they were to be good close mates, and the wits humoured both about it, but it was good to see the bon homie at Celtic in the squad.<br><br>Celtic fans were singing at the end of the season after a wonderful double v Partick Thistle in a 5-0 win in May 2017, <i>&quot;Sign Him Up Sign Him Up&quot;</i>. Was it possible? Affordable? At the then quoted levels, it was beyond Celtic&#39;s reach.<br><br>He was what the fans wanted. Paddy Roberts could jink round players and score round them, or drive across the outside of the box before taking a long range effort into the back of the net, or simply lay it off with little effort for his team mates. You could see his joy. There was a desperation for him to be signed up.<br><br><b>2017-18</b><br>Celtic managed to retain him for a further season in season 2017-18, frustrating the support as a further loan but then was ruled out for chunks of the season. This actually lent James Forrest the opportunity to make the role in the side for himself, and following some great performances, Paddy Roberts was to be little missed. <br><br>In fairness, the fair on the pitch wasn&#39;t as entertaining as in the previous season, but as Celtic were heading towards a second treble in a row, the support was still happy. The loss of Paddy Roberts was a reason but not the full explanation for Celtic&#39;s slip in form in season 2017-18. When back, he alternated with Forrest, and won a penalty that helped cement a victory over Sevco in the Scottish Cup, a 4-0 victory. His sleight of foot again winning penalties against clueless Huns. He really gave the first team new options when offered by anyone.<br><br>James Forrest was now the favoured man, and there was actually less of a call for Paddy as there was a year beforehand. As a crude measure, Paddy Roberts only scored one goal in the whole of season 2017-18 compared to 11 the season before, albeit in a special 3-0 victory away v Anderlecht. So was Paddy Roberts really a luxury?<br><br>Critics were complaining that Paddy Roberts&#39; magic was waning and that the perceived excessive cost for Paddy Roberts was a wasted effort that season which was harsh as Paddy Roberts still gave his all in the matches he played, and still performed. Forrest though had become more than match for him in terms of value at least.<br><br>However, it was clear that the run was coming to an end at Celtic. His name kept on popping up as being used as part of a transfer package to Leicester in Man City&#39;s efforts to buy players, which was disrespectful to Paddy Roberts. The fees for a full transfer were likely beyond Celtic, and in any case with a packed out midfield and a rejuvenated Forrest, Paddy Roberts was becoming surplus to Celtic&#39;s needs.<br><br>Anyhow, after 2.5 years at Celtic, he clearly wanted a new challenge down south. Disappointing as Celtic could offer so much more than just bread and butter domestic games as the lower sides in England would, but he was to again move on loan this time to Girona (Spain). It was a cash-cow loan system that was allowing major league clubs to hoard players and make a mint from them by loaning them out. It wasn&#39;t helping anyone apart from the mega-clubs.<br><br>It was great to have had Paddy Roberts for his time at the club. A joy at many times to watch.<br><br>He had his own journey now.

The treatment meted out to the winger in the early stages at Hampden could also play a part in Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; men having captain Scott Brown on board when they set course for Ibrox at the weekend.<br> <br> Inside three minutes the 20-year-old Manchester City loanee was wiped out when Andy Halliday flew in on him with a wild, late lunge that brought only a yellow from referee Willie Collum. Meanwhile, whether Brown plays on Saturday in the sixth and final Old Firm derby of the season will be settled by an SFA appeal on Thursday over the automatic two-match ban he received for the straight red card shown him by Don Robertson. That dismissal came for a challenge on Liam Boyce against Ross County the Sunday before that appeared to be a lesser offence than that committed by Halliday.<br> <br> Roberts was asked if the difference in card colour for the two transgressions gave him hope that Brown might be successful in his appeal &ndash; the triggering of which at the Easter weekend allowed him to play in the semi-final.<br> <br> &ldquo;Yeah. If that&rsquo;s only a yellow why was Scott&rsquo;s a red card?&rdquo; the Englishman said.<br> <br> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to say too much but it was a bad tackle and thankfully I didn&rsquo;t get hurt. It&rsquo;s an Old Firm game and maybe the ref thought about it like that and gave a yellow. I felt the ref was pretty good and thankfully we won.&rdquo;<br> <br> Roberts wasn&rsquo;t interested in finger-pointing towards the officials or opponents in the wake of the most incisive displays of his 18-month loan period, something that was reflected in his assessment of the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t just Halliday who could have walked for attempting to stop Roberts in crude fashion in the opening stages. Teenager Mylde Beerman was booked for a heavy challenge and then in the immediate aftermath was not penalised for deliberately tripping the winger. <br> <br> &ldquo;Beerman is only young and I know what it feels like to be young and playing in a big game under pressure like that,&rdquo; Roberts offered in magnanimous fashion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough and my job was to keep getting at him and force him into mistakes. I felt I did that at times, although he did pretty well against me. He showed good experience at times and he&rsquo;s a good young player who can do well in the game.&rdquo;<br> <br> Sunday was Roberts&rsquo; first start against Rangers this season. The player has seen more action through the middle as an emergency striker of late than the flanks, with Scott Sinclair and James Forrest the preferred wing options. In the semi-final, though, Roberts was given the nod over Forrest, and fully capitalised on the opportunity.<br> <br> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to get in the team. We have had a great run this year and there is a lot of competition for places. The standard is high and whoever the manager puts in does a good job. It was a good team performance more than anything.<br> <br> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been the perfect loan move for me. I honestly couldn&rsquo;t have asked for any more. I have come to a big club where there is a lot of expectation and you are playing under big pressure. It&rsquo;s huge and we have managed to have a lot of success. It&rsquo;s worked out really well for me.<br> <br> &ldquo;I see a big difference in myself. I am a lot more mature and I&rsquo;m just really happy with my progress. <br> <br> &ldquo;Last year was good and I&rsquo;ve now played over 50 games for the club. I have got three medals already and I now have a treble in mind too. I want to win everything and I want to finish the season really strongly. There is still a lot to play for. Winning the Scottish Cup would just top it all off. This season has been great under the manager. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot, scored goals, created them and also played in a lot of big games. It&rsquo;s been a great loan spell at Celtic.&rdquo;<br> <br> The greatest possible end seems certain to elude Roberts, though. He proved an integral member of the England under-20 squad that last month qualified for the World Cup finals that will take place in South Korea next month. Starting in the middle of May, England are scheduled to play their third and final group game against the hosts on 26 May &ndash; the day before Celtic will meet Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final that is the one more victory they require to complete the club&rsquo;s first domestic clean sweep since 2000.<br> <br> The fact the Roberts is forever circumspect when asked about the scheduling clash tells its own story about where he sees himself in Scottish Cup final week &ndash; on the other side of the planet as a, by then, former Celtic player who received a good grounding before hoping for a crack at the highest level of the English game with parent club Manchester City.<br> <br> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really say too much about that at the moment. We just have to see what happens. All I know is that it&rsquo;s not up to me,&rdquo; said Roberts, Celtic being obliged to release the player to the England FA for the Fifa tournament. <br> <br> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t really say anything more. I&rsquo;m just glad that Celtic are in the final.&rdquo;</font><br> </font><br><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">   </font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3> Patrick Roberts: I&rsquo;ll always be a Celt</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/12730<br>By: Jo Hendry on 30 May, 2017 16:47<br><br>PATRICK Roberts may have taken his final bow for Celtic but he did so in considerable style, finishing what has been an incredible season as a winner of an &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; treble.<br><br>The Englishman joined the Hoops last year on an 18-month loan deal from Manchester City, and is now due to return to the English Premier League side for the beginning of the new season.<br><br>The 20-year-old has made 60 appearances since joining the Bhoys last February, netting 17 goals along the way, and the winger admits he couldn&rsquo;t have asked for more from his time in Paradise.<br><br>Speaking to the official Celtic website, he said: &ldquo;Perfect is the exact word I&rsquo;d use. To be &lsquo;Invincible&rsquo; is one thing, but then to go and win the treble is really something else. We&rsquo;ve done it and it&rsquo;s full credit to all the boys.<br><br>&ldquo;It just feels unbelievable. We had our tasks to do this year and we&rsquo;ve completed all of them. It&rsquo;s been a great season and I&rsquo;m thankful for it.&rdquo;<br><br>Last weekend&rsquo;s 2-1 victory over Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final ensured the last piece of silverware required to secure the domestic clean sweep was bound for Celtic Park.<br><br>The game looked to be heading for extra-time with the two sides locked in a 1-1 draw before Tom Rogic stepped up in the 92nd minute and made his mark on history. After beating two defenders, the Australian slotted the ball under Dons goalkeeper, Joe Lewis, before Hampden erupted in a sea of green and white.<br><br>&ldquo;I was ecstatic when the ball hit the net,&rdquo; Roberts admitted. &ldquo;I kept looking at the clock and could see that time was running out, but I knew we could do it. When Tom hit that ball and it went in the net, there was a massive sense of relief.<br><br>&ldquo;It was a tough game against Aberdeen, though. They&rsquo;re a good side and we knew that - that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re second in the league. But we stuck to our guns and in the end, thanks to our perseverance, we got there. To win the treble has been amazing, and there&rsquo;s no better feeling than scoring in the last minute. It was a good game and a tremendous occasion.&rdquo;<br><br>While the England Under-20 star was ecstatic when the final whistle sounded at Hampden, signifying that the momentous treble was in the bag, there was one person missing from the celebrations.<br><br>Kieran Tierney, who had started against Aberdeen at left-back, had his final endeavour of the season cut short by the arm of Jayden Stockley in the first-half of the game.<br><br>However, Roberts made sure the defender wasn&rsquo;t forgotten as he held the No.63 jersey aloft in tribute to his friend and team-mate, who made it back from hospital just in time to lift the cup.<br><br>&ldquo;I think he was hoping to get back for full-time,&rdquo; Roberts said. &ldquo;But when the final whistle went we were cheering and, obviously, he wasn&rsquo;t there so I thought he&rsquo;s Mr Celtic, and he&rsquo;d want to be here.<br><br>&ldquo;The fans love him and he&rsquo;s the golden boy, so I thought I would get his shirt and show them he&rsquo;s a big part of Celtic. I was hoping he&rsquo;d make it back because I couldn&rsquo;t take the trophy to hospital.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he was there in the end, though, and he&rsquo;s alright. He&rsquo;s a tough cookie. He tells me he&rsquo;s a Lanarkshire boy and he&rsquo;ll just get on with it. I&rsquo;m sure his jaw will fix itself.&rdquo;<br><br>The winger added: &ldquo;I just want to say thank you to the supporters for everything that they&rsquo;ve given to me. All the support that they&rsquo;ve given me on and off the pitch has been tremendous.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always be a Celt and I&rsquo;ll always have this club in my heart. This year has been massive for me, as well as for the club, and I&rsquo;ll always remember it.&rdquo;   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>Celtic star Patrick Roberts has shown a lack of ambition by returning to Scotland - Gordon Parks<br></h3>[Bitter Hun writing from the Sunday Mail, not a parody incredibly]<br>The winger opted for a second stint in Glasgow rather than trying his hand abroad.<br><br>Sunday Mail BYGORDON PARKS<br>06:00, 3 SEP 2017<br><br>The great Jackie Chan takes the credit for the truism: &ldquo;Great success comes only with great ambition.&rdquo;<br><br>Wise words in a week when Patrick Roberts opted to chop another year off his career by re-signing on loan with Celtic.<br><br><br>An inconvenient truth it may be but he has chosen to step back into his comfort zone rather than showing a belief he can push himself to a higher level.

He may now have bid farewell to  the Hoops, but Roberts admitted that a piece of his heart will forever  remain in Paradise.  The 21-year-old winger played his last match in the Hoops at Scott  Brown&rsquo;s Testimonial where he offered a parting gift of a goal before  receiving a standing ovation when he was substituted.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a good two-and-a-half years here,&rdquo; said Roberts in an  exclusive interview with the Celtic View. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve enjoyed it, I&rsquo;ve won  trophies, I&rsquo;ve met a lot of good people and I&rsquo;ve loved every minute of  it.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously sad that my time here has come to an end but  everything comes to an end and I have a lot of really good memories of  playing here. The success this season has been incredible and I&rsquo;m happy  that the Celtic fans have had that, because they&rsquo;ve been amazing.&rdquo;  The dear green place became something of a home away from home for  Roberts. Much of that can be attributed to the way Celtic fans received  him and the love they have shown for the youngster, who left his home  and family to come up to Scotland build further his career.  &ldquo;The Celtic fans are second to none. It&rsquo;s like a family up here and  I&rsquo;ll always feel part of the family,&quot; he said. &quot;Celtic&rsquo;s been good to me  and I hope I&rsquo;ve been able to repay the fans, the board, staff and  players.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the reason why I wanted to come back here. I&rsquo;ve had ups and  downs but the fans have been there for me throughout it all and I&rsquo;ll  always be thankful for that.&rdquo;  His gratitude towards the fans, his team-mates, staff and the club is  centred on his appreciation for all that Brendan Rodgers has allowed  him to achieve and the way the manager, as he has done with so many  young players, has helped develop his game.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll definitely cite Brendan Rodgers as a big factor in my  development as a player,&rdquo; said Roberts. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s improved my game in a big  way. I&rsquo;m grateful to Ronny bringing me in and then to the manager for  continuing that and showing the faith in me throughout these two years.  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been incredible and I&rsquo;ll be thankful to him for that forever.  Hopefully it puts me in good stead for the rest of my career. Having a  start here at Celtic has meant a lot and I&rsquo;m thankful to everyone  involved.&rdquo;<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><div></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><br></div></div>
