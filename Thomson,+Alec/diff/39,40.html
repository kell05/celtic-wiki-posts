He was one of the great club servants in the difficult inter-war years, and paid very loyal service to the club. <br><br>Signed from Wellesley Juniors in 1922 the Buckhaven-born inside-forward made his competitive debut on November 4th that year in a 1-0 league victory at Clyde. <br><br>Seen as a natural successor to the great Jimmy McMenemy, Alec Thomson was a clever craftsman who had the vision and ability to thread intelligent passes through the tightest of defences.<br><br>He perhaps lacked the strength and physique to get too physically involved with the more combative elements of the game but he was never one to shirk his defensive responsibilities and his workrate was impressive. This earned him the nicknames of &#39;<i>EverReady</i>&#39; and &#39;<i>McGrory&#39;s fetch and carry man</i>&#39;. <br><br>But his real talent lay in attack and with the ball at his feet he was always capable of causing major problems for any defender. He was a tricky player capable of beating opponents with twisting runs but his deadliest weapon was his sublime precision passing. He was to be an important part of the great frontline of &#39;Connolly, Thomson, McGrory, McInally and McLean&#39;. <br><br>A real crowd favourite Alec Thomson&rsquo;s vision helped create many a goal for Celtic and the great Jimmy McGrory described the inside-forward&#39;s passes as &quot;beautiful&quot;, or more fully: &quot;<i>Not a strong player but he used to lay on beautiful passes for me</i>&quot;.<br><br>That he <span class="diffRemove">was </span>played <span class="diffAdd">in </span>so many matches for Celtic, is a clear indication of his value to the club. <span class="diffRemove">he</span><span class="diffAdd">He</span> only missed the one single game in the entire league title winning season of 1925-26.<br><br>In a near 12 year Parkhead career Alec Thomson played a total of 451 games for the Bhoys and scored 98 goals before departing for Dunfermline in June 1934. He later played some matches against Celtic but thankfully never scored. At Celtic, he became a Scotland international, and won a league championship and four Scottish Cups in his time.<br><br>So with a fairly proud and long record at the club, why is he so little referenced by the support? Partly this is possibly due to his surname, the resonance of the name for the era for most of the support is with his colleague <a href="/page/Thomson%2C+John+%281926-31%29" target="_self">John Thomson</a>, who sadly died during a match that both Alec Thomson&#39;s played in (and both came from the same region of Scotland). Also, he was unfortunate to play at a time when Celtic were less successful relative to other generations of Celts. Granted he won some great silverware, but one league title is a low return for all his efforts.<br><br>Nevertheless, he still won a good cache of medals but the club had begun to seriously underachieve, a decline that would accelerate fast into the following decade after his departure. The Celtic sides he played in were inconsistent and so he has won less attention than other players from teams from different eras. <br><br>Off the field, he was a very unassuming character, and even on the field due to his slight build he was remarked as <i>&#39;the frail lad that wore the green</i>&#39;. When he had his false teeth out, he never looked very intimidating. He was a modest gentle person, and this lack of steel possibly cost him greater recognition as reflected in the low number of Scotland caps he received. Despite that low number of caps, he still managed to play for Scotland in a 1-0 win over England at Old Trafford in April 1926.<br><br>However, his good nature is something to respect and admire, and as a measure of his person, he even tried out of his own good nature to assist the wayward Tommy McInally on occasions, despite its futility too often. To try at least shows the great mark of a man.<br><br>So in the bigger picture Alec Thomson&#39;s name in the canons of Celtic&#39;s history has in consequence become overshadowed by others. It&#39;s a shame for such a good name in our history and this requires some redress. He is though rightly remembered as a great Celt by those fortunate enough to have either seen him play or have read up on him. His loyalty and length of service deserves him to be given greater attention.<br><br>Alec Thomson can be ranked as the greatest Celtic servant between the war years, and that should always be remembered.<br><br>After Celtic, his talents were appreciated at Dunfermline where he was made captain and was a regular goalscorer.<br><blockquote>1934-35, Dunfermline Athletic, League 38 apps/4 goals, Scottish Cup 1/0 (Team Captain)<br>1935-36, Dunfermline Athletic, League 34/9, Scottish Cup 3/1 (Team Captain)<br>1936-37, Dunfermline Athletic, League 7/0, Scottish Cup 0/0<br>1937-38, Wick Academy, Qualifying Cup. <br></blockquote><br>He died in November 1975, and in the following league game at Parkhead (contested between Celtic and Motherwell on 15 November 1975) both sets of players wore black armbands as a mark of respect on his passing away. A fine Celt. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="center" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderRight-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" class="WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderRight-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="16%">  1922-34</td>  <td align="center" class="WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="16%">  392</td>  <td align="center" class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="16%">  59</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  451</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals: </td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  85</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  13</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  98</td></tr></tbody></table></div><i>*Note: &quot;A Century of the Celts&quot; says he got 101 goals in 451, &quot;An Alphabet of the Celts&quot; says 98 goals. <br></i>  <br><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>Scottish League <br></b>  <ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/1926" target="_self">1925-26</a></font></li></ul><b>Scottish Cup  <br></b>  <ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1924-25" target="_self">1925</a>, </font><font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1926-27" target="_self">1927</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1930-31" target="_self">1931</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1932-33" target="_self">1933</a></font></li></ul><b>Glasgow Cup</b><ul><li><font size="2">4</font></li></ul><b>Glasgow Charity Cup</b><ul><li>  <font size="2">2</font><br></li></ul><div align="center">  <div align="left">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Thomson%2C+Alec+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul>  <div align="center">  <div align="left">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div></div></div></div>  <div align="center">  <div align="left">  <h3>  </h3></div></div><h3>On this day in history: Celtic great, Alec Thomson born in 1901 				 				</h3><div class="newsInfo"> 					By: Joe Sullivan on 14 Jun, 2019 09:38http://www.celticfc.net/news/16286</div><div class="rtearea"><br>ALEC Thomson led the way from Fife to  Paradise in 1922, a route that would be followed four years later by his  namesake, John. While the latter became known as &lsquo;the prince of  goalkeepers&rsquo;, the former was an inside-forward who produced an  impressive century of goals during 12 years with Celtic, though his fame  is less well-known.  <br><br>That is understandable, of course, given the tragic circumstances of  John Thomson&rsquo;s untimely death in 1931, an event that Alec Thomson was  witness to, given that he was in the Celtic team that fateful day.  Alec Thomson was a player who provided a skilful touch to the Celtic  team and was the provider of many Jimmy McGrory goals over the years. He  was also a consistent performer, and was very rarely out of the team  when fit. In the 1920s and &lsquo;30s, Celtic didn&rsquo;t enjoy as much success as  they had in the first two decades of the 20th Century, and the great  sides that Willie Maley had built in those early years were never  replicated, though there were many great players who wore the Hoops with  distinction during this period. Alec Thomson was one of those players.  <br><br>In James Handley&rsquo;s book, The Celtic Story, he described how, when  Tommy McInally moved to Sunderland in 1928, &lsquo;Thomson assumed the mantle  of Tommy McInally. He had always been a brainy player, but now he became  schemer-in-chief and was early being acclaimed as the best  inside-forward in the business.&rsquo;  He did not perhaps the flair or flamboyant personality of other  Celts, such as McInally, which perhaps explains why a player who made  451 appearances for the club and who scored 100 goals in not more widely  regarded or revered, but Alec Thomson&rsquo;s contribution to Celtic is one  worthy of praise.  <br><br>PRELUDE TO PARADISE  <br>Starting his football career at Glencraig Celtic, Alec Thomson moved  to Wellesley Juniors and that club proved to be a fruitful hunting  ground for the Hoops in the 1920s and &lsquo;30s, with a number of players  coming to the club from there and proving their worth in the East End of  Glasgow. Alec Thomson was the first to arrive at the club, signing for  Celtic on October 9, 1922. Celtic&rsquo;s next signing from the same club  proved to be equally successful when John Thomson joined the club in  1926. In 1930, Celtic recruited centre-forward Frank O&rsquo;Donnell from  Wellesley and two years later he was joined by his younger brother,  Hugh, another Wellesley graduate. Joe Cowan was another Wellesley  Juniors graduate, signed for Celtic after scoring 12 goals in five games  for the Fife side, but he would only make one appearance for the Hoops.  That came in a league game against Aberdeen at Pittodrie in January  1931, when he scored in a 1-1 draw.  <br><br>DEBUT BHOY  <br>The new inside-right made his debut as a 21-year-old against Clyde in  the league on November 4, 1922 when a 10,000 crowd at Shawfield saw  Celtic take both points thanks to a goal from Jean McFarlane in a 1-0  win. Alec Thomson played in a further eight games sporadically that  season but missed out on Celtic&rsquo;s victorious Scottish Cup run that  culminated in a 1-0 win over Hibernian. He did, however, net his first  goal for the Hoops near the end of that season when Hearts visited  Celtic Park on April 7. It was the new Bhoy who opened the scoring after  just 10 minutes, and Joe Cassidy made it 2-0 for Celtic 15 minutes  later. Hearts reduced the deficit in the second half, but Celtic held on  to win the match.  <br><br>HIGHLIGHTS  <br>Alec Thomson&rsquo;s first medal as a Celtic player came in the &lsquo;Patsy  Gallacher final&rsquo; of 1925 when the Irishman conjured up an extraordinary  goal to help bring the cup back to Paradise. Jimmy McGrory provided the  winning goal with three minutes of the match remaining. Alec Thomson  would add further Scottish Cup medals in 1927 (3-1 win over East Fife),  1931 (4-2 win over Motherwell) and 1933, (1-0 win over Motherwell). To  add to those four Scottish Cup wins, he also helped lift the league  title in season 1925/26 as Hoops won the championship. Thomson played in  37 of the 38 league games played that term with the only game he missed  coming after the title was won &ndash; the second-last game of the campaign  when Celtic beat Hamilton Accies 3-1 at Douglas Park. He scored 19 goals  that season, including 15 in the league, an impressive contribution to  the team&rsquo;s overall league total of 97 goals. Not surprisingly, Jimmy  McGrory was top scorer with a total of 42 goals, while Tommy McInally  netted 22 and Adam McLean scored 20.  <br><br>LOW POINTS  <br>Alec Thomson spent 12 years at Celtic and only won the league on one  occasion. He had left the club by the time another title arrived in  1936, and Celtic didn&rsquo;t manage to achieve the level of consistency to  lift the title, although they enjoyed better success in the Scottish  Cup. However, Alec Thomson, like his contemporaries, suffered the  greatest devastation of all with the death of their friend and  team-mate, John Thomson in 1931. Like Alec Thomson, John was a Fifer and  fellow graduate of Wellesley Juniors, and even by the age of 22, had  already carved out a reputation as a goalkeeper of grace, agility and  bravery. He had been part of the team which had lifted the Scottish Cup  the previous season with the victory over Motherwell, and was part of  the Celtic party which toured North America that summer. His loss was  one that affected everyone at the club, as did the death of Peter Scarff  two years later, another great talent who sadly passed away at a very  young age.  <br><br>BOWING OUT  <br>Alec Thomson&rsquo;s last appearance for Celtic came in the penultimate  game of the 1933/34 season when Celtic played host to Hamilton Accies.  The Hoops were out of the running for the league title and would finish  third, 19 points behind winners, Rangers. They had also exited the  Scottish Cup in the fourth round, losing to St Mirren at Love Street.  The game against Hamilton, on April 23, 1934, saw Celtic produce a  superb display of attacking football, beating the Lanarkshire side 5-1,  with Frank O&rsquo;Donnell and Johnny Crum both scoring doubles, and John  Divers adding a goal. Thomson, whose last goal for Celtic came in a 4-2  victory over Airdrie at Celtic Park on December 2, 1933, which also  proved to be his 100th for the Hoops, returned to Fife and joined  Dunfermline where he remained for three years before retiring at the age  of 36.  <br><br>WHAT&rsquo;S IN A NAME  <br>Alec Thomson was one of three players of that surname who plied their  trade for Celtic in the 1920s and early &lsquo;30s. John Thomson joined  Celtic four years after Alec and made his debut in February 1927 against  Dundee. He was brave and fearless, while also being graceful and agile,  and he was already Celtic&rsquo;s first-choice keeper - and Scotland&rsquo;s - by  the time of his death in 1931. The third of the Thomsons was Bertie, an  outside-right who played for the club between1929-33. He made his debut  against Cowdenbeath in November 1929 and went on to make 131 appearances  for the club, scoring 30 goals. His finest moment came in the replay of  the 1931 Scottish Cup final against Motherwell, when he scored two  goals in the 4-2 victory.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div><br></div>
