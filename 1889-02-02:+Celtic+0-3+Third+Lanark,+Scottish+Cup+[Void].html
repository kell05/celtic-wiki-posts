Snow, however, fell all day, and at a quarter-past three, the hour fixed for the start, the ground was unplayable. Both teams lodged protests, which of course rendered the match no Cup tie, but fearing a disturbance, no intimation was made to the public.<br>Under these circumstances, the match cannot be taken as any indication of the real form of the teams, although the Third, who won by three goals to nothing, adopted the most judicious tactics considering the state of the field. The spectators in and around the grounds could not have numbered less than twenty thousand, and the gate and stand money amounted to &pound;920 &ndash; said to be the largest sum ever taken in Scotland.<br>Punctually at 3.15 the Third, having lost the toss, kicked off and some exciting play immediately took place in front of the Third goal. A corner fell to the Celts, and McLaren all but headed through the goal. The Celts were having decidedly the best of matters. The Third, lead by Marshall and Oswald retaliated, but they could not get the ball past midfield. Downie was several times called upon to save his charge, which he did in excellent style. McCallum put in a rare shot, which hit the cross-bar, and went over.<br>Marshall and Oswald raised the hopes of the Third supporters until pulled up in clever fashion by McKeown. A trip against McKeown made the Third look dangerous for the first time during the contest, but McLaren, with a good header, put the ball out of danger. Kelly was deservedly cheered for a splendid piece of play. The ball was taken to the Celtic goal by Hannah, who centred neatly to Oswald, jnr, and the latter beat Kelly amid a scene of wild excitement. After this reverse the Celts played up with renewed vigour, and the Volunteers&rsquo; goal had some marvellous escapes. A foul right in the Volunteers&rsquo; goal-mouth looked as if the Celtic efforts would be rewarded, but do as they would they could not get the ball through the posts. Half-time arrived with the Celtic one down, although they had the best of the contest.<br>After a short interval the game was resumed, McCallum being early prominent with a dashing run on the right; while a foul further still enhanced his side&rsquo;s prospects. Johnstone replied with a run equally as brilliant, and T. Kelly had some anxious moments.<br>Some beautiful passing amongst the whole front rank of the Celts took place, and the ball was brought in front of Downie, but the forwards persisted in their close passing, tactics, which, with the ground in such a condition, were practically of no use. Groves caused some excitement by one of his sensational runs, but the ground was against him, and he was deprived of the ball. The game continued very exciting and after a clever run by the Third forwards, Oswald, jnr, defeated Kelly a second time. The cheers which greeted his success were deafening. The Celts replied so feebly to this second reverse that the spectators realised that a Cup tie was not being played, and as snow began to fall heavily, hundreds left the field. The play after this calls for little description, the players being barely distinguishable, and, as far as could be seen, play was ruling at midfield.<br>Just before Mr Campbell blew his whistle the Third rushed the ball down and put on a third goal.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Report 2</h3>The interest taken in the final tie for the Scottish Cup played between these teams on Hampden Park was something phenomenal. Unfortunately the weather was of the worst possible description. In the forenoon showers of snow began to fall, but at one o&#39;clock the members of the Association Committee, accompanied by their secretary, Mr McDowall, made an inspection of the ground, and declared it to be playable.<br>About two o&#39;clock, however, the storm increased in severity. Heavy drifting snow began to fall, and continued to come down up till the time of starting the game, when it lay some inches deep on the field.<br>The committee and officials were placed in an awkward position. The ground had become almost unplayable, and a meeting was hurriedly held in the Queen&#39;s Park pavilion. The result was that the committee decided that the cup tie should be played.<br>Meantime, however, both teams entered a protest against playing the tie, and they stepped on the field with the understanding that a friendly game only take place. What the Association will do in the circumstances remains to be seen.<br>It was generally admitted that there could be no real test of merit under the conditions in which the game was played. Still, taking the soft state of the ground into account, it was one of the best matches of the season.<br>From the beginning to end the struggle was carried on with a keenness and determination that could scarcely have been surpassed.<br>The Celts who won the toss, played with the wind at their backs. This was undoubtedly a great advantage, but they did not make the most of it, for although they pressed their opponents very severely for a considerable time, they failed to score.<br>The Third played a defensive game, reserving themselves for the second-half, but when they got clear down the field, they scored, Marshall heading the ball through very cleverly after the game had played twenty minutes.<br>This early success of the Volunteers depressed the Celts considerably. They continued, however, to do most of the pressing, and several times experienced the hardest of hard lines.<br>McCallum, who did not seem much the worse for his recent indisposition, made several clever attempts to score, but Downie saved grandly, and at this stage, indeed throughout the entire game, showed defensive powers of no mean order. He was, of course, ably assisted by the half-backs and backs, particularly Lochhead, Thomson, and Rae, who did great service for their team.<br>Shortly after the change of ends, the Third came away with great dash, all their forwards working remarkably, and when, after ten minutes&#39; play, young Oswald scored the second goal, all hope of the Celtic being able to equalise was given over, and this estimate of the Celts&#39; ability turned out to be correct, for not only were they prevented scoring, but just a minute from the close the Volunteers registered a third goal, and won.<br>The Third certainly played a winning game, but they had all the luck that was going, and a draw, judging from the play, would probably have been a more fitting termination of the match. The Volunteers have had a brilliant series of successes. They have [played more high-class games than any other team this year, and shown consistent form throughout.<br>Anyone, however, who witnessed the game on from an impartial point of view will admit that there are not three goals difference between the teams. No two combinations could have been more evenly matched, and in the event of their meeting again on a dry day the result should be very close.<br>All the forwards of the Third on played up to the form expected of them. Their half-backs showed to great advantage, while Thomson and Rea left as little work for Downie to do as possible.<br>Of the Celts, probably McLaren was a long way the best half-back on the field, and the magnificent game he played will not readily be forgotten. It was no lack of his that the Celts did not score. Kelly also played up to his reputation, and McKeown at back excelled the others in the first half, but fell away greatly in the second period.<br>Taking into account the nature of the ground, the forwards at times showed pretty and effective passing, McCallum&#39;s shooting for goal being as well judged as ever.<br>Groves, however, did not feel at home in the snow, and suffered in the conditions, however, the Celt is a brilliant exponent of the game.<br>All the others did well, but as we have said, Saturday was not a day to judge the relative merits of the teams.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Report 3</h3>The final tie for the Scottish Cup was played between these two teams on Hampden Park. The attendance of spectators was a record one in the history of football in Scotland, there being, it is considered, 18,000 present. The money drawn at the gate was over &pound;800, while &pound;120 was taken at the stands, making a total of &pound;920.<br>The weather was most unfavourable, but notwithstanding large crowds began to wend their way to Crosshill even an hour and a half before the time at which it was advertised the match would begin.<br>As has been said, a more unpropitious day, so far as weather was concerned, could not have been conceived. In the forenoon there were gusts of wind, accompanied by heavy showers of snow, which, however, were not of long duration.<br>A thin coating of snow covered the field, and, in consideration of these facts, there were misgivings as to whether the game would be played. At eleven o&#39;clock &quot;the officials&quot; paraded the field, and even went as far as playing a little game on the quiet, and decided that the ground was playable. As the day advanced the showers were heavier, and between two and three it fell in one continuous blinding shower.<br>The decision to play the match having been come to, however, the people were admitted into the field, and thronged in thousands. The time of waiting for the commencement of the game was most unpleasant, for the snow was driven along the field in violent gusts, and there was no shelter from the blast. But one topic was discussed. &quot;Will the game be a cup tie?&quot; was the question asked on all sides, and while uncertainty may have existed as to what would be the answer, everyone was agreed on the inadvisability of settling so important a match on such ground.<br>A meeting of the Association was called hurriedly in the Queen&#39;s Park pavilion, and it was decided, notwithstanding that the ground was by this time quite unplayable, that the cup tie should be played. Both teams played under protest, and it was understood that a friendly game only should be played.<br>The Volunteers were the first to appear on the field, and received a hearty cheer. They were followed immediately afterwards by the Celts, who came in for even greater cheers. Some amusement was caused by the teams engaging in snowballing each other.<br>The Celts won the toss and played with the wind at their backs. The Celts were the first to press, and got dangerously near Downie. A foul, however, was given against the Irishmen, and the pressure was relieved for a time.<br>Ultimately the Celts secured a corner, and kept crowding round their opponents&#39; charge. Another corner fell to the Celts but nothing came of it, and the Third looked like getting away when they were stopped by W Maley. Neil McCallum sent in a beauty, which Downie fisted out in time. The Celts, however, retaliated, and pressed their opponents severely. They had the hardest of hard line, for Downie, who was playing in grand form, frustrated all their efforts to score.<br>Under the circumstances the Celtic showed magnificent passing, and McCallum, who did not seem any worse of his recent indisposition, was in fine form, and elicited the heartiest cheers by his fine shooting.<br>The wind aided the Celtic immensely, but all the same the Volunteers could not get away, and the Celtic had many a try which in ordinary circumstances would have been successful. The Celtic certainly showed the better generalship, for the Third had several chances to get away, and did not avail themselves of the opportunities. Marshall had a clear field before him, but McKeown came in the way and returned the ball to midfield.<br>At length, however, Marshall did get away on the right. He was tackled, however, by the opposing back, and a foul having been given against the Celts, the Third got well down. The ball, however, was again returned by the Celts, who showed a beautiful bit of passing. Kelly sent the ball across the goal mouth, but Downie again saved immediately.<br>Just immediately afterwards the Third got clear away, and Johnston centring to Marshall, the latter player scored the first goal for the Third about 20 minutes from the start, amidst great cheering. The Volunteers again assumed the aggressive, and a good shot was sent in which Kelly had to kick out.<br>Showers of snow heavier than before now came on, and it was with the greatest difficulty that the ball could be taken along the field. The Celts returned to the attack, and had hard lines, as several times they sent in the ball, but Downie, ever on the alert, denied all the efforts of the Irishmen.<br>Fate was against the Celts, as they crowded round Downie, making a vigorous onslaught on the Third&#39;s charge. It seemed as if the ball must go through, and a regular scrimmage was formed in front of Downie, but all to no purpose. The Celts again secured a corner, but again Downie came in the way, and the Celts&#39; efforts were spoiled.<br>Aided with the wind, the Celts had undoubtedly the best of the game, but the Third were also in the humour, and defended grandly. Everybody was prepared to give a cheer, as it looked a certainty that the Celts would score, but Downie saved magnificently, and sent away shots that should have gone through.<br>Again and again the Celts tried to get on an equal footing with their opponents, and although favoured with a foul right in front of goal, they could not get the ball through. All the luck was against them, but at the same time it must be stated that the Volunteers were defending splendidly. Twice again the Celts had almost scored, but Downie came to the rescue, and despite all efforts the ball could not be got through.<br>Just about the call of half-time a foul was given against the Celts in midfield. The Third got away, but the ball was sent past on the left. The Third now pressed hard, but McKeown, certainly the best back on the field up to this stage, relieved by a strong kick.<br>Half-time was now called, the score standing - 3rd LRV, 1 goal; Celtic, 0 goals.<br>The Volunteers had now the wind in their favour, and came away with great dash at the outset. An excellent shot was sent in, but McKeown relieved in the nick of time.<br>The Celts now came away, McCallum having a grand run, when he was stopped by Rae. However, the Third returned to the attack, and sent in a fine shot, but Kelly fell on the ball, and saved what, in nine times out of ten, would have been a certain goal. After some play in midfield, the Third again pressed, and nearly scored, the ball passing by only a few feet. The Celts came away after the goal kick, and McLaren sent in a magnificent shot, but nobody came up, and the pressure was easily relieved.<br>Considering the elements the game was very fast, more so than in the first period of the game. Both sides were playing their very utmost, and it was really a difficult matter to say which had the best of it. A heavy shower of hail came on at this stage, and rendered it very difficult for the players to move the ball along the field.<br>The Volunteers had now the upper hand, and paid a visit to the Celtic goal, when a shot was sent to Kelly, who cleared his charge. The Celtic, playing in the teeth of the blinding shower of hail, gave the Third great anxiety. McLaren made a grand effort to score, getting very near to goal, but unfortunately no one was there to assist him.<br>Runs and counter runs followed, and both sides had occasionally to resort to kicking into touch to save their position. The Third again returned to attack, and crowded round the Celtic goal as if they meant to increase the score. The ball was, however, got away.<br>Groves, beginning a good run, was tackled by Thomson, and relieved of the ball. The Third looked dangerous, and should have scored, had they taken the opportunity at once. They continued to have the best of it, and Marshall in attempting to score sent the ball high over the cross-bar. Two moments later Oswald tried a good shot, which just went over the bar. A little afterwards a foul was given against the Celts 20 yards from goal, but it no good effect.<br>The Celts afterwards came away in grand form, and great efforts were put forth by McLaren, who showed the way by sending in a judicious shot, which was saved by Thomson. The ball was then sent to the right, and a splendid try was made. Everybody thought the Celts had scored, and a vigorous shout was given, but the goal kick brought people to their senses. The ball had passed the post closely.<br>It was now the Third&#39;s turn, and they pressed hard, sending in two or three shots which all but beat Kelly. Ultimately, however, he was beaten. Young Oswald scored the second goal for the volunteers. Kelly tried to catch the ball, but it slipped through, and no wonder, for it was completely covered with snow. A great cheer was given. It was now felt that it was all over with the Celts, as with the wind against them and the heavy ground the chances of scoring were remote.<br>Twenty-two minutes of the game had yet to go, but the enthusiasm was waning. The Celts, mainly through the efforts of McLaren, who was playing a brilliant game, got well down the field, but made nothing of it, as they could not get very near Downie&#39;s charge. The last fifteen minutes&#39; play was almost entirely in the hands of the Volunteers, who pressed the Celtic combination severely, taxing the energies of the whole back division, and calling into requisition the saving powers of Kelly to a very great extent. Occasionally the Celts broke away, but the ball was always brought back, and kept almost continually in the ground of the Irishmen.<br>A minute from the blowing of the whistle Hannah sent in a swift high shot, which passed between the Celtic posts in the southern corner, thus scoring the third goal for the Volunteers.<br>Immediately after the ball was kicked off from the centre of the field, the whistle was blown, and the game ended thus - 3rd LRV, 3 goals; Celtic, 0 goals.<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="1889-02-02: Celtic 0-3 Third Lanark, Scottish Cup [Void] - Pic" height="1500" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/OkslNVczaL-U_y8BMJuB4w1193329/GW980H1500" title="1889-02-02: Celtic 0-3 Third Lanark, Scottish Cup [Void] - Pic" width="980"><br><div></div><div><img alt="1889-02-02: Celtic 0-3 Third Lanark, Scottish Cup [Void] - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/4c6c0_u0oeRQNKYu_mwsvg222920" title="1889-02-02: Celtic 0-3 Third Lanark, Scottish Cup [Void] - The Celtic Wiki"></div><div></div><img align="bottom" alt="1889-02-02: Celtic 0-3 Third Lanark, Scottish Cup [Void] - The Celtic Wiki" height="1343" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/a250d6d300cacb45f88b56ebcc4fad64/GW684H1343" title="1889-02-02: Celtic 0-3 Third Lanark, Scottish Cup [Void] - The Celtic Wiki" width="684"><br></div></div>
