It would also be churlish to deny their scumbag supporters were very impressive atmosphere wise.<br><br>That&#39;s not to say we were collectively awful but just not good enough at this level, Europe&#39;s 2nd competition. Griffiths had a shocker. GMS continued his season of dross and Lustig was roasted by their winger throughout the game. On the flip side Tierney and Simunovic were good, while Allan showed some promising signs from the bench.<br><br>Sadly we conceded yet more calamitous goals. First one was a simple cross with two headers before scrambling over the line, while the second was down to our defence being woefully exposed in a 3 v 2 counter attack situation. Gordon&#39;s position was also suspect to say the least.<br><br>In terms of the midfield, while the selection didn&#39;t transpire to be as disastrous as I predicted beforehand, you could sense a complete lack of aggression and Ajax took advantage of that at times. Oh and having known Fenerbahce were winning in Norway, it was particularly pleasing to see our MOTM replaced by his fellow left back, talk about going for it...<br><br>This game also proves yet again that mentally we are so weak. It&#39;s the 7th European game in the past 2 seasons where we&#39;ve taken the lead, yet failed to win. Also our fitness was shocking and there were no signs whatsoever of the much fabled high pressing game that we were told to expect by now.<br><br>Overall it&#39;s just a relief that this utterly disastrous European campaign has been put to an end. With a game to spare, we can&#39;t even finish 3rd. Best send our reserves to Istanbul, perhaps Boerrigter will be indoctrinated by Daesh and may become a better player in the process.<br><br>On a positive note, hopefully tonight was Ronny&#39;s final ever home European game as Celtic manager <br><br>(Silent W of KDS)<br>All about goals for sure. If LG scores when one on one, then this thread changes completely and we&#39;re talking about some promise for the future. <br><br>The overall performance is not altered by individual incidents, even if the result is.<br><br>Two years ago, we played Ajax in the CL and won 2-1. However, we were lucky then as they missed a stack of good chances. And yet here, we restricted their chances and competed well in midfield, with a below strength team. Relative to that game, we were actually better, albeit against an Ajax side that is certainly weaker than then. <br><br>I had given up on Europe before this game, so I actually enjoyed it and was encouraged by the way we competed against a side that is always good in possession, and always makes you work. We didn&#39;t hoof the ball up the channels or up to a big target man (as we&#39;ve done in the past), but played a compact midfield that was better than I thought it would be. But a lot of the players lack experience at this level, and there&#39;s only one way to get it. That also means that mistakes are inevitable. <br><br>Also, with the enforced changes, there was less of the old guard on the pitch, so we got an idea of what the future holds. Despite the disappointment, I&#39;d be very surprised if Ronny was in any danger. Seems the norm to scream out for scapegoats, but it&#39;s not going to do resolve anything. We&#39;ve been needing a European style coach for some time, which comes with the inevitable changes of style but also the setbacks on the way. I don&#39;t want to abandon that just to appoint a safe, steady results-driven British style of manager. I also doubt that we could bring in a more effective European style of coach than Ronny. So, he gets my vote of confidence for next year. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Teams</font></h3><div class="home-team"> </div><h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3><div class="home-team"> </div><div class="home-team"><ul class="player-list"> <li>01 Gordon </li> <li>23 Lustig </li> <li>20 Boyata </li> <li>05 Simunovic </li> <li>63 Tierney (Izaguirre - 78&#39;

Through the course of the match the Swede was guilty of not getting close enough to his marker, getting too close and turned easily, and giving away a rash foul, all in dangerous areas. His ill-advised pass to an under-pressure McGregor led to the first goal.<br> <br> DC - Jozo Simunovic &ndash; 7<br> <br> The &pound;4.5 million signing may be a long way from living up to his price tag, but his assuredness at the centre back position will give hope to Celtic fans in the future.

At times he snuffed out Ajax attacks with the anticipation you want from a burgeoning centre back. Then he would let opponents in with a sloppy touch or pass when he was the last line of defence. By no means the worst on the night but still lacks concentration to shine at a higher level.<br> <br> DL - Kieran Tierney &ndash; 8<br> <br> Once again the left-back was Celtic&rsquo;s star performer in an otherwise dismal European night. He was strong in the tackle, stood up to the task even when isolated against the opposing wide players, and continually supported from deep. He was forced from the action with a late injury.<br> <br> MR &ndash; James Forrest &ndash; 6<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> The speedy wide-man was surprisingly quiet in the first half before growing into the contest after the break. Once again the final pass, particularly after a memorable run in which he slalomed passed three players before trying to reverse for Griffiths, was lacking when it counted. He did a solid job defensively.<br> <br> CM - Tom Rogic &ndash; 6<br> <br> Started in an unfamiliar position sitting in front of the back four with Armstrong and McGregor ahead of him, though he was given license to get forward as the half went on and started behind Griffiths after the restart. His passing was solid in the deeper role though he dropped out of the game a little when pushed further forward.<br> <br> CM &ndash; Callum McGregor &ndash; 7<br> <br> Prior to the match, the 22-year-old had started only one other match this season - against Raith Rovers in the League Cup &ndash; though he didn&rsquo;t show any signs of rust as he rose to the occasion. Netted a superb opener and was often the link between defence and attack when Celtic built their moves. Unfortunately, he&rsquo;s another who gets a mark off for one crucial mistake, when his slack touch started the move from which Ajax equalised.<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> CM &ndash; Stuart Armstrong &ndash; 5<br> <br> Often used on the wings at Celtic, Armstrong was trusted with a start in his more natural role in the centre of midfield. The ex-Dundee United man battled hard but was another who often lacked quality in the final third. He did, however, thread through a clever pass to find McGregor in space, which the youngster used to open the scoring.<br> <br> LM &ndash; Gary Mackay-Steven &ndash; 5<br> <br> The winger deserves some credit for fighting back to help break up Ajax attacks, even in the centre of the park where his side were short-handed with no natural defensive midfielder. However, on the ball he often made the wrong choice or executed a poor pass.<br> <br> FC &ndash; Leigh Griffiths &ndash; 3<br> <br> A night to forget for the Celtic striker. It wasn&rsquo;t just a case of Griffiths missing opportunities (which he did), it was that he often made the wrong choice and just looked plain greedy in the final third, going for goal at ridiculous angles rather than passing to team-mates in better positions. No doubt a deadly finisher, he does lack composure in one-on-one and close range chances, as evidenced by his miss after being played through by Allan.<br> <br> Substitutes<br> <br> CM &ndash; Charlie Mulgrew &ndash; 3<br> <br> Came on to give Celtic a proper defensive minded player in the central midfield position, he never fully got up to speed with the game and couldn&rsquo;t unleash his range of passing. Oddly walked off the field after Ajax&rsquo;s winner.<br> <br> AM &ndash; Scott Allan &ndash; 6<br> <br> The former Hibernian star&rsquo;s introduction gave the home side a real shot in the arm, with his pass through for Griffiths a real moment of excellence. However, he blotted his copybook when robbed on the edge of the Ajax penalty area before the away side broke up field to score the winner.<br> <br> DL &ndash; Emilio Izaguirre &ndash; n/a<br> <br> The left-back came on as a late like-for-like replacement for the injured Tierney.

McGregor&rsquo;s inclusion in the central midfield area of the 4-1-4-1 set-up, preferred to Scott Allan or Charlie Mulgrew, was vindicated by his part in Celtic&rsquo;s hugely promising start to the contest.<br> <br> McGregor flourished in the early days of Deila&rsquo;s tenure last season, his three goals in Champions League qualifiers during that spell even earning him a call-up to the senior Scotland squad. The 22-year-old&rsquo;s star has waned considerably since then, to the extent his only previous starting appearance for Celtic this season came in the League Cup tie against Raith Rovers.<br> <br> Ajax celebrate the equaliser 1-1 scored by Milik.

It was their speed of thought which almost caught Celtic out when Nemanja Gudelj cleverly played a free-kick short to Lasse Schone on the right of the penalty area, his effort from a tight angle clutched by Gordon.<br> <br> But the Celtic goalkeeper, who at 32 was by far the elder statesman of a Celtic side with an average age of exactly 24, was unable to prevent Ajax&rsquo;s 22nd-minute equaliser.<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> As has so often been the case for Celtic in Europe under Deila, it was a concession borne of slackness and individual error.<br> <br> Unfortunately for McGregor, his heavy touch presented Ajax with the opening which saw Schone&rsquo;s shot deflected into the path of Viktor Fischer. The Danish international&rsquo;s effort was parried by Gordon but Fischer was able to guide the loose ball into the path of Milik who hooked home a shot from close range.<br> <br> The goal sparked a period where the momentum was with the visitors. A mistake by Tom Rogic, who began the night in the holding midfield role for Celtic before being switched into a more advanced position, allowed Ajax captain Davy Klaassen to set up a chance for the lively Younes who curled a shot narrowly over.<br> <br> Kieran Tierney, delivering another enterprising display at left-back for Celtic, got the hosts back on to the front foot with a surging run to play in Leigh Griffiths on the left side of the penalty area but the striker screwed his shot wide.<br> <br> Griffiths was more isolated than usual in Celtic&rsquo;s reshaped system, the lone striker feeding on scraps such as when he latched on to a long Gordon clearance and managed to engineer a position for a shot comfortably held by Cillessen.<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Ajax dominated possession for the opening 20 minutes of the second half, albeit without causing too much concern to the Celtic defence. Deila&rsquo;s men had lost impetus and he responded with a couple of changes, Mulgrew replacing Rogic and Allan coming on for Mackay-Steven.<br> <br> It prompted the desired response as Celtic increased the urgency and tempo of their work. McGregor almost snatched his second goal of the night when his 20-yard shot was deflected on to the crossbar, then a delicious pass from Allan sent Griffiths clear on goal, only for his shot to be diverted wide by a fine save from Cillessen.<br> <br> The pressing need to find a winner, which applied to both teams, was intensified by news of Fenerbahce leading in Molde. Celtic should have gone in front when Mulgrew headed wide from close range, then Younes struck Gordon&rsquo;s left-hand post with a curling shot.<br> <br> Both teams were fully committed to attack and it was Ajax who plundered a decisive strike. Allan&rsquo;s cheap loss of possession left Celtic exposed at the back, allowing Milik to lead a counter which presented 18-year-old Cerny with the chance to plant a precise shot beyond Gordon.<br> <br> Celtic, who have now conceded 15 goals in their last seven European games, finished another miserable night with just ten men as Mulgrew limped down the tunnel.<br> <br> Referee: S Vincic (Slo)<br> <br> Attendance: 38,000<br> <br> CELTIC: Gordon, Lustig.

They likely wouldn&rsquo;t have lost the game either if they hadn&rsquo;t needed to win in the final minutes.<br> <br> Young players, particularly Kieran Tierney and Callum McGregor, stood up to the test, while Jozo Simunovic lasted 90 minutes and looked fairly solid at the middle of an improved, if still clearly lacking, Celtic defence.<br> <br> However, Ajax they were in name, but not in nature.<br> <br> The visitors were missing a number of key players themselves and have endured, until last night, a fairly dismal Europa League campaign of their own.<br> <br> It&rsquo;s a once great club that&rsquo;s been on the decline for a couple of decades now and doesn&rsquo;t look like recovering any time soon. At least not to be a proper European force once again. And yet Celtic still allowed them to take three points from a trip to Glasgow.<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> The real problem for Ronny Deila going forward is that, throughout the squad, in nearly every area, his players haven&rsquo;t looked capable. It&rsquo;s not just one problem that can be fixed in a transfer window. At least not without heavy investment or some really shroud signings.<br> <br> 2) Deila does have the ability to alter his formation and system<br> <br> Hurrah! Even if you believe that a football team should play a certain brand of football, it&rsquo;s usually not a clever idea to go professing to all and sundry that this is the only style your team is going to use. Molde probably didn&rsquo;t even need to watch DVDs of Celtic games, they just needed to read Ronny Deila&rsquo;s reaction in match reports.<br> <br> With a defence as weak as any witnessed at Celtic Park since the John Barnes era, Deila finally set up his side to sit back more and counter attack. It works well for two reasons, 1) with Leigh Griffiths and James Forrest on the pitch, along with Gary Mackay-Steven to a lesser extent, he has players who can hurt opponents running in behind, and 2) it affords the defence greater protection across the 90 minutes.<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> The second goal would likely never have come had Celtic not chased a late winner, and the first goal was a bit of a fluke. That may look like this writer is making excuses for the back four, but the ability to even make excuses for such a sorry excuse of a unit is a definite improvement.<br> <br> If Deila has learned to be more pragmatic in Europe it could become a silver lining in the otherwise all-encompassing dark cloud that&rsquo;s been this campaign - should he make it to next season.<br> <br> 3) Scott Allan should be given a run in the side<br> <br> The former Hibs man was far from perfect, but in his initial 10 minute burst after entering the field of play there was no doubting his quality and he should have swung the game in Celtic&rsquo;s favour.<br> <br> He&rsquo;ll have games where he drops out of things completely and others when he falls in love with the reserve pass for no apparent reason, but with Celtic&rsquo;s season lacking definition, at least until the League Cup semi-final, checking out the potential of some high-ceiling fringe players is exactly what Deila should be doing.<br> <br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> <br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> If he can get it right with Allan he&rsquo;ll have a top class player on his hands. The midfielder&rsquo;s vision and ability to pull off passes such as the one played through for Griffiths is something that only Stefan Johansen can match, and even then the Norwegian&rsquo;s form has been deeply disappointing this campaign.<br> <br> 4) The striker question is back<br> <br> Ever since Gary Hooper left to return down south, Celtic fans have waited and waited for the next striker who&rsquo;s going to replicate Hooper&rsquo;s heroics in Europe.<br> <br> After terrific showings at home to Malmo and Fenerbahce, it seemed certain they&rsquo;d finally found that man in Leigh Griffiths. Scotland fans also used such evidence to beat Gordon Strachan with since they felt the Celtic hit-man should be starting over Steven Fletcher for the national side.<br> <br> But there&rsquo;s a reason Strachan doesn&rsquo;t trust Griffiths with the lone striker role in the Scotland team, and it&rsquo;s been shown in the three games since the Fenerbahce draw.<br> <br> That small sample size doesn&rsquo;t definitively prove that this is the real Griffiths. He&rsquo;s improved as a player throughout his time at Celtic and could improve further to the point where he&rsquo;s definitely the man to lead the team in Europe, while simultaneously forcing Strahan to reconsider his opinion. But it does raise the question of whether Celtic should be looking at other options at striker if they want to get better in Europe.<br> <br> Speaking of whom, where is Carlton Cole?</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">BBC<br></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> By Alasdair Lamont<br> </font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">BBC Scotland at Celtic Park Celtic exited the Europa League at the group stage as Ajax grabbed a late victory on Thursday night. <br></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br> A typically energetic start to the game brought an excellent early breakthrough from Callum McGregor on three minutes. <br> <br> But Ajax drew level as carelessness led to Arkadiusz Milik converting acrobatically from close range. <br> <br> As Celtic pressed hard in the closing stages, Leigh Griffiths and Charlie Mulgrew spurned chances and Vaclav Cerny broke away to score. <br> <br> Celtic going backwards?<br> Celtic&#39;s third group defeat leaves them out of Europe and bottom of Group A with just two points. <br> <br> Manager Ronny Deila has continually spoken of encouraging signs, despite the lack of positive results in Europe. <br> <br> And although they matched the Dutch league leaders for spells on Thursday, the bare facts are that Celtic are regressing in European terms. <br> <br> In 25 European matches with Celtic, Deila has managed just eight wins, with four of those coming against part-time Icelandic sides. <br> <br> Supporters seeking solace can point to an impressive cameo from Scott Allan and another solid display by Kieran Tierney against Ajax, but the normally reliable Leigh Griffiths misfired and he was not the only under-performer. <br> <br> Callum McGregor scores for Celtic Callum McGregor opened the scoring for Celtic with just three minutes gone <br> <br> Bright start<br> Nonetheless, spurred on by a noisy support, Celtic came out of the traps sharply and gave the bulk of the crowd reason to get to their feet. <br> <br> Despite an unfamiliar midfield set-up, with just Tom Rogic acting as the pivot between defence and the attacking players, Celtic immediately looked comfortable. <br> <br> A confident flick by Stuart Armstrong found Rogic, who in turn fed Gary Mackay-Steven. He threaded a beautiful pass for McGregor, who belied his recent lack of first-team action as he strode confidently forward before curling a perfectly-placed shot beyond the diving Jasper Cillessen. <br> <br> Just as they had in previous European ties this season against Malmo, Fenerbahce and Molde, they had made the ideal start. <br> <br> Familiar failings<br> Unfortunately, another recurring theme was soon to emerge. <br> <br> Ajax served notice of their own desperation for the points as Viktor Fischer slammed the ball into the net, only for Amin Younes to be wrongly flagged offside. <br> <br> The equaliser was not delayed much longer, though, and this time a lack of match sharpness may have hampered McGregor as his heavy touch ceded possession. <br> <br> The Dutch got the break of the ball as Schone&#39;s shot was deflected into the path of Fischer, who was able to head the rebound from his own effort across goal where Milik hitch-kicked the ball into the net. <br> <br> As the game wore on, the reality of the situation seemed to spur Celtic on as they pressed for a winning goal and McGregor struck the bar while Griffiths was foiled on more than one occasion. <br> <br> And with time running out, Allan, who had made such a positive impression as a substitute, was caught in possession and the Dutch broke, culminating in a clinical finish by Cerny. <br> <br> The full-time whistle was greeted with boos as the Celtic support came to terms with an early European exit. <br> <br> Ajax retain hopes of progressing, but they need to beat group leaders Molde, who have already qualified for the last 32, and hope Celtic can beat Fenerbahce in Istanbul, though on current form that appears a forlorn hope.<br> BBC<br> Europa League: Celtic&#39;s Leigh Griffiths takes blame for exit<br> </font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">By Alasdair Lamont<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">BBC Scotland at Celtic Park Striker Leigh Griffiths took responsibility for Celtic&#39;s defeat by Ajax and failure to progress beyond the Europa League group stage. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> <br> Griffiths has been in electrifying form this season, with 18 goals, including four in European competition. <br> <br> But he missed a series of chances in the 2-1 loss in Glasgow. <br> <br> &quot;If my finishing was a lot better we&#39;d have kept our place in Europe. But we got beaten and in my opinion it&#39;s all down to me,&quot; said Griffiths. <br> <br> &quot;I can&#39;t fault the team - they were outstanding. My performance was shocking really. <br> <br> &quot;On another night, I&#39;d have scored two or three. My shooting boots weren&#39;t on the right feet tonight.&quot; <br> <br> Griffiths appeared ponderous as his familiar instinctive finishing deserted him. <br> <br> Was he growing more anxious as the chances came and went? <br> <br> &quot;Not after the first chance, but when you start missing two, three and four it starts to get to you a little bit,&quot; he admitted. <br> <br> &quot;I&#39;m one of those confidence players - if I get once chance and don&#39;t put it away, I&#39;m confident I&#39;ll put the next one away. <br> <br> Ajax players celebrate at Celtic Park Ajax remain third in Europa League Group A but can still qualify <br> <br> &quot;Obviously tonight was one of those nights I couldn&#39;t hit a barn door.&quot; <br> <br> Two second-half opportunities in particular vexed Griffiths. <br> <br> &quot;The first one, Scott Allan&#39;s played a great ball through and at first I thought I was offside, but you&#39;re always told to play to the whistle and I&#39;ve just tried to bend it round the keeper, and he&#39;s made himself big and made a good save,&quot; he recounted. <br> <br> &quot;The other one, Stuart Armstrong&#39;s played a great ball in and I was contemplating taking it first time or taking it back inside and I&#39;ve taken a bad touch and tried to take it round him.&quot; <br> <br> Griffiths has dug Celtic out of a few holes already this season and one bad evening in front of goal cannot erase those memories. <br> <br> The striker was asked whether he had felt the need to voice these same sentiments in the changing room. <br> <br> &quot;I couldn&#39;t speak,&quot; he replied. &quot;I&#39;m disappointed in myself and I feel sorry for the rest of the boys. <br> <br> &quot;Tonight&#39;s performance - apart from my shooting - you can&#39;t fault. We played a really good game and we were the better team, I thought, on the night.
