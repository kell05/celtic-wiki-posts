This timeCeltictook the Edinburgh side apart, and afterwards Tommy Burns&#39; players were convinced they now have the skills and the desire to break Rangers&#39; hold on the title.<br>Confidence is beginning to course throughCeltic. This feeling of well-being was evident in the way they walked away from Easter Road on Saturday night and it had been obvious earlier in the way they played. No-one needed to say how good they feel, but one or two did anyway.<br><br>The captain, Paul McStay, who has his testimonial match against Manchester United atCelticPark tomorrow night, agreed the team are playing as well now as at any time in recent years and added: &quot;I know we won the Scottish Cup last year, but winning the championship could be regarded as the real turning point for us.&quot;The most significant point about McStay&#39;s words was that he actually mentioned the title andCelticin the same breath, and he wasn&#39;t just mouthing words either.<br>McStay, like the rest ofCeltic&#39;splayers, have come to believe in themselves, and the title which Rangers have owned for the last seven seasons is the only prize they want.<br>It was not so very long ago whenCelticwere little threat to Rangers because of the boardroom and managerial turmoil which undermined confidence on and off the pitch, but, with finances more stable, a new ground still rising in the East End of Glasgow, and a studious manager in Burns, the future holds great promise.<br>Burns&#39; ways, which are not much removed from the traditionalCelticways, in fact, are showing through and they are also too much for most of his team&#39;s opponents.<br>Celticmove the ball with elegance and ease, and into their game has been introduced a variety of speeds. When necessary, players like McStay and John Collins slow down and seem to scan defences in front of them, working out ways of cutting through, but, when the opposition is caught on the break,Celticshuttle the ball forward at high speed.<br>Usually, several players are involved and the attacks are given an attractive fluency which tends to bemuse anyone trying to read their play. There is little doubt nowCelticare playing the most intricate and appealing football in the top division.<br>However, Rangers remain the side they will have to overcome if the title is to be shown off again atCelticPark and there is about the Ibrox side a greater resilience. They have been restrained because of injuries and suspensions yet they are still clear at the top of the premier division and, having become used to first place, they will not relinquish that position easily which suggests the second half of the season could be thrilling.<br>Celtic, too, are learning to cope with the loss of players and went to Easter Road without John Hughes and Peter Grant, but the pattern was not disrupted.<br>&quot;It is easier for players to slot into a team when that team is playing well,&quot; said McStay, who had been doubtful because of a cold. &quot;I spent Friday in bed and that was enough. I don&#39;t want to miss any games.&quot;<br>His recovery and determination to play was disappointing for Brian McLaughlin, who had been told by the manager on Friday night that he would be playing in place of the captain, but, when the players arrived on Saturday, McStay was waiting.<br>He later radiated good health and he performed with a grace and vision which no-one else could match.<br>There were enjoyable displays also from Collins, Simon Donnelly, who is relishing his role as a wide midfield player, Phil O&#39;Donnell, and Jackie McNamara. The full back scored the opening goal - his first forCeltic- in 11 minutes when he was perfectly placed to finish off a well-constructed move involving Donnelly and Pierre van Hooydonk.<br>McNamara&#39;s surged into Hibs&#39; box and, when Donnelly&#39;s chip-in arrived, he volleyed the ball into the net. It was a splendid goal which incorporated speed, touch, and awareness.<br>However, it should be said Hibs made it easier forCelticto look good when a moment of weakness reduced Alex Miller&#39;s side to 10. Only Darren Dods will know why he wrestled O&#39;Donnell to the ground in 17 minutes after Darren Jackson had tackled Andreas Thom heavily, but the outcome was costly. Dods walked and Jackson was cautioned.<br>Thom easily evaded Andy Millen on the left nine minutes later and squared the ball for O&#39;Donnell to score from close range and, even that early in the match, everyone knew it was all over.<br>Celticwent in search of more goals, but the third came 12 minutes from the end when van Hooydonk&#39;s powerful header beat Jim Leighton, who was foolish enough to get himself booked for having spoken out of turn to the referee at the end of the first half.<br>Poor defensive play allowedCelticpossession in 85 minutes and their new signing, Morten Wieghorst, played a good ball through to van Hooydonk, who then supplied Donnelly running free into Hibs&#39; box. The youngster took the fourth goal well.<br>&quot;We were beaten by a better team,&quot; said Miller, understating the obvious. &quot;However, we faced an uphill struggle when Dods&#39; inexperience left us a man short.&quot;<br>As for Burns, he said there is more to come from his players. &quot;I couldn&#39;t be happier right now, but I feel the team will get better. The players are working very hard every day and the attitude is spot on.&quot;<br>Celtichave been returning for more work in the afternoons for several weeks now and the players feel the benefit training hard in the mornings and then dealing with passing and movement in the afternoon sessions.<br>&quot;If you want to be good at anything you must work,&quot; McStay added.<br>Well said, sir.</div><div></div><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td><div class="sevPx"><br><b>The Times</b><b>December11, 1995; Monday<br>Celtic&#39;srevival upholds McStay tradition<br></b><br><b>BYLINE:</b>Kevin McCarra<br>JUST over a year ago, a group of visiting supporters to Easter Road held up cards that spelt out the words: You&#39;ll never walk alone Paul.&#39;&#39; This was an expression of solidarity with theCelticcaptain, Paul McStay, who had missed the penalty in a shoot-out three days earlier that saw Raith Rovers defeat his team to win the Coca-Cola Cup.The raising of that message was a moving, if maudlin, moment, but it did not inspire victory.Celticcould only draw withHibernian, extending a spell that would eventually bring a club record of 11 league matches without a win. On Saturday, McStay and his side returned to Easter Road and inflicted a 4-0 drubbing.<br><br>On this occasion, the travelling supporters had no need to be solicitous of McStay, but tomorrow evening he will monopolise every speck of emotion when Manchester United provide the opposition for his testimonial match. Genealogy and McStay&#39;s own inclinations have forged an extraordinary bond between man and club.Two of his great-uncles captainedCelticbefore him and one, Jimmy McStay, went on to become manager. His older brother, Willie, played in the first team with Paul and is now youth coach. Another sibling, Raymond, was also on the club&#39;s books. The testimonial, though, is a reward for what Paul has made of his inheritance.<br>McStay was eager to talk last week of the delight that he had taken in watching a stylishCelticyouth team match the night before. Supporters and employers should cherish McStay for the anachronism that he is. A move to Italy did tempt him, and he came close to joining Udinese in 1992, but, for him, football really finds its meaning only withCeltic.<br>The club has been his cause since he made his debut, at 17, in 1982. The relationship, however, has not always been cosy, and McStay has discovered the cost of loyalty. As with so many child prodigies, adulthood brought him a measure of pain.<br>CelticPark is full of spectators whose recollections of McStay stretch back to his precocious mid-teens, and some could even recall the precise spots in the Wembley nets that two of his shots struck when Scotland schoolboys beat England 5-4 in 1980. Those who have seen the whole of McStay&#39;s career, however, cannot help but attempt to take its measure. Then the cavilling starts.<br>In bad times, supporters complain of McStay&#39;s supposedly stunted development as a player, as if it were an image of the club&#39;s failure to realise its potential. The grumbling, given McStay&#39;s 72 caps and collection of medals, verges on the ludicrous, but it is true that he cannot, as an adult, be the overwhelming force he was as a youth.<br>Growing up is like that. Professional football, in particular, is an abrasive workplace. McStay is as fine a performer as unremitting dedication could make him. In addition, when he is berated for not winning matches single-handed, critics mistake the nature of his gifts.<br>McStay is a team player, expert at shielding the ball until a colleague is in place to take yet another imaginative pass. His level of performance is strongly influenced by the standard of the side. If there is no adept forward to find space, the accuracy of McStay&#39;s delivery carries less influence.<br>He is returning to his highest standards because an attractive team is once more gathering around him. Although Darren Dods, ofHibernian, was sent off on Saturday, the superiority of the visitors had already been established.<br>Celticremain four points behind Rangers, 1-0 winners over Partick Thistle, but, for McStay, the benefits of this season may include not only the proceeds tomorrow, but also the emergence of a team that is worthy of him.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div></div></div><div></div><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="1%"><div class="sevPx"><br><b>The Independent (London)</b><b>December10, 1995, Sunday<br></b><br><b>BYLINE:</b>David Dick</div><div class="sevPx"><br>THE GULF between Europe and Scotland&#39;s top sides may be wide but a similar gap is appearing at the top of the Premier Division. Third-placedHibernianconceded four goals to a Glagow side for the second time in three weeks, this timeCeltictaking advantage to extend their lead over them to 10 points.At this early stage it seems the title is a two-horse race. How realistic isCeltic&#39;schallenge to Rangers remains to be seen, but they swamped Hibs with a fluidity and movement the Edinburgh side could never hope to contain. The match was basically over at half-time. At 1-0 down Hibs were reduced to 10 men, but even before the dismissal of Darren Dodds there was little doubt which team was more likely to win.<br><br>It tookCelticonly 10 minutes to open the scoring with a goal of breathtaking movement and sublety. Jackie McNamara began the move on the half-way line and finished it when he received Simon Donnelly&#39;s chip at the edge of the box and produced a delightful lob to beat the Hibs goalkeeper Jim Leighton.Their play had Hibs constantly stertched and their dominance was too much forHibernian&#39;sDodds to take. In a tussle for the ball with Phil O&#39;Donnell he snapped, swung his forearm round the midfielder&#39;s neck and was sent off.<br>After that it was only a matter of time beforeCelticincreased their lead and it came after 26 minutes. Andreas Thom skipped past Andy Millen&#39;s lunging tackle and whipped in a cross for the onrushing O&#39;Donnell to score.<br>Hibs changed their game in the second half but that only left them exposed at the back and theCelticmidfield carved them open at will. Pierre van Hooijdonk made it three when his diving header finished off a John Collins cross. The Danish international Morten Wieghorst came off the bench for hisCelticdebut in time to see Donnelly stab in their fourth with six minutes to go.<br>By this time the Hibs stands had cleared and all that was left was the celebratingCelticfans dreaming of things, such as titles, to come.</div><div class="sevPx"><img align="bottom" alt="4-0 Hibs  Dec 95" height="913" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/G7iT8x87GvpgqLXhHBDZvw1099463/GW746H913" title="4-0 Hibs  Dec 95" width="746"></div><div class="sevPx"><img align="bottom" alt="1995-12-09.
