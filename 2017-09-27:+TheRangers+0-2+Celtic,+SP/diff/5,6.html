Truth is 2-0 in first gear Scott Brown strolled it&quot;<br>Paddy Power on Twitter: &quot;BREAKING NEWS: A Glasgow resident has been asked if he can hear the  Rangers sing. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear a f*cking thing,&rdquo; he replied. More to follow&quot;<br><br>Sevco banner &quot;3 letters emblazoned on our breast RFC&quot;. <br>Celtic banner &quot;3 letters emblazoned on your grave RIP&quot; Brilliant undercover work!<br><br>(Steviefrombelfast of KDS)<br>I thought the score would-be a bit tighter today and so was the game -  until we scored the second anyway. We were well short of our best in the  first half although we should have went in a few ahead at half time. I  thought rogic, Roberts and Sinclair were all a bit missing in the first  half. Once we moved into second gear there was only going to be one  winner. As others have said we clearly were thinking about Wednesday  night in the last 25 minutes. As regards the Huns they were  very poor -  in reality we made them look better than they were in the first half.<br><br>As  regards sky&#39;s penalty at the time I thought it was more of a dive  and  still do. What the pundits arent saying is that the fat Hun had clearly  lost the ball and went down about ten minutes later with no contact. The  ref was right on top of it and had no doubts at all that it wasn&#39;t a  penalty. that sleegit bastard lovenkrands must be smoking whatever pedro  is - two absolute loon balls. And I have to say back when others were  taking his side against Ronny i posted that commons would go and be an  absolute souptaker in the media after he left us. He will have got  himself a contract after that performance today. 						 						 						 					<br><br><br>(Caltonbhoy of KDS)<br>Dawdle - Never had to get out of 3rd gear.<br><br>Second half was a  training exercise for Wednesday - Once we were ahead we kept ourselves  in check as we and they knew they had nothing to offer.<br><br>Brown   bossed it and absolutely  ripped it out of them at the same time -  They are shiiiiit scared of him - His sheer disdain and contempt for  their fud of Manager as he let Pedro prattle on was a thing of beauty. <br><br>Brendan  gets it right again - Rogic then McGregor - Roberts then Forrest -  Griffiths then Dembele or a complete reversal of this  in other games is  exactly how to play games out - With Edouard now in situ we have some  strength in depth in the squad as far as Scottish football goes - Nobody  will live with Celtic over the course of a season domestically - CB  position is still a problem re Europe.<br><br>Thompson by his standards  did okay albeit a few Zombies should have been carded earlier and if so   at least one might have taken an early walk.<br><br>Pedro  - Words fail  me - I used to think he was working his ticket as he knows he won&#39;t  last but now I have come to the conclusion he is a  complete zoomer!!!  Fwiw my resident pet zombie clown of a neighbour has texted me that on  the one hand he thinks that was a vast improvement  from them   and on the other hand he informs me that  they have a poll running  on  Pedro going or staying and the result will be presented to the Zombies  Board - That will work!!! <br><br>Walker  - Beyond parody and an embarrassment - The things people do and say to keep a coin coming in.<br><br>Lovenkrands - A fud trying  to ensure he keeps his Zombie Under 20&#39;s coaching gig and Zombie tv number going - Feck him <br><br>Commons  - In danger of going down the same route a few others.<br><br>Zombies  are what they are an irrelevance and mid table keech at best - Pedro is  unlikely to see the season out even if Jabba keeps giving him the  soundbites to try and keep the vermin appeased for a while longer  -   Betfred Cup will keep the hordes from the door for another few weeks -  In the league before  they play us amongst others  they have to play the  Sheep twice - Perthshire Farmers twice - Diet huns away  - Hibs away  and the Family Club in the cup and league<br><br>Happy days  - Well done yet again Brendan Rodgers and well done Celtic.<br><br><br>(ronan Cfc of KDS)<br>Pena - Waster<br>Cardoso - Lightweight, can&#39;t tackle<br>Dorrans - expensive Andy Haliday. Legs gone.<br>Morelos - decent finisher, hopeless movement, diving carrot.<br>Candeias - A winger that can&#39;t run.<br>Jack - Gives them a bit of protection but is totally average<br>Alves - Done.  Boy in for him today coped better than he would have<br>Nemane - Who?<br>Dalcio - Where?<br><br>They&#39;ve  thrown everything at it in the summer and came up with worse than last  year.  eff knows what kind of garbage they&#39;ll find when they go back to  raking the bins<br><br><br>(PARODY)<br>HOW THEY RATED<br><br>By PETER LOVENKRANDS<br><br>Foderingham - How  could he save those Celtic goals, they were both offside and he was  fouled despite being the best goalie in the world. 9<br><br>Tavernier - Tav the must have, as in must have covered 100 miles with his running. Super-fit. 10<br><br>Cardoso  - Can&#39;t be blamed for nothing, great player and didn&#39;t put any of his  feet wrongly. Will learn from this and conquer the world. 9<br><br>McCrorie - Baresi and Maldini rolled into a loyal blue dervish. Didn&#39;t deserve to be on a losing side. Penalty! 10<br><br>Hodson  - Brave like a scarecrow. Pushed the Celtic players all over the pitch.  Fitness not in question and should have had 3 penalties. 10<br><br>Jack - None of the Celtic players played as well as Jacky. Man of the match performance for me. Penalty! 9<br><br>Pena - Strolled his midfield circumference of 2 feet like an expert. Rangers had as many chance as Celtic right? 10<br><br>Dorrans  - Braveheart warrior should have had a hat-trick was it not for the  fact he didn&#39;t have a shot on target. Four penalties ruled out too. 10<br><br>Candeias  - Such a great fitness performance from this energetic star. Scott  Brown take note, plastic hard man.

Picture: Mark Runnacles/Getty Images <br>Moira Gordon<br>Published: 13:54 Saturday 23 September 2017 <br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/rangers-0-2-celtic-champions-57-unbeaten-with-win-over-rivals-1-4567977<br>Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; Celtic once again underlined their Old Firm superiority as they claimed a 2-0 Ladbrokes Premiership win over Rangers at Ibrox.<br>&bull; READ MORE: Celtic fans unveil RIP banner aimed at Rangers<br>There was an angry exchange between Leigh Griffiths and his manager midway through the second half. The striker had got himself involved in some niggle with Josh Windass and Brendan Rodgers wanted him to press the reset button and focus on the game.<br>By that stage Celtic had made the breakthrough but, as they sought out a second, decisive goal, the Parkhead manager was calling for calm heads and cool hearts, something that is not easy in the heat of a Glasgow derby. It is even more difficult for a player like Griffiths, who continues to taunt and tantalise in equal measure.<br>Having initially bitten back, the Scotland international eventually raised his hands in submission. Rangers eventually did likewise.<br>Few had backed them to do any better in the fixture than they did last season. Five wins for Celtic and one draw were ample evidence of the champions&rsquo; superiority and contributed to an unbeaten domestic run that has now stretched to 57 games.<br>It had also, according to Rodgers, left a few scars. It there were old wounds, Tom Rogic sliced them open with a 50th-minute goal to silence the home crowd and leave Celtic partying. Then Griffiths got himself back in his manager&rsquo;s good books with a second to make sure of the points. As his angled drive hit the back of the net, he wheeled away, picking up a Celtic scarf to whirl over his head as he ran past the home fans where he was joined by ecstatic team-mates.<br>It was 500 days exactly since the treble winners last lost a domestic tussle and the celebration demonstrated their joy that they would not be suffering their next defeat at the hand of their city rivals.<br>Celtic had started at full pelt, swarming all over their hosts in an attempt to grab an early opener.<br>Rogic was first to strike, but his first-minute effort was tipped over the bar by Wes Foderingham. Sensing the need to get a foothold, as Patrick Roberts ran riot and Celtic threatened to camp out in the Rangers half, Ryan Jack made a robust tackle that felled the on-loan Manchester City winger and could have earned him a booking. Later in the game it probably would have been a caution but referee Craig Thomson was reticent to flash cards too early in a game that always has a combustible quality. There was little respite for Rangers in that opening period. Missing key defenders, with Bruno Alves, captain Lee Wallace and Danny Wilson all injured, the makeshift rearguard was placed under severe pressure but with an impressive display from 19-year-old Ross McCrorie, it stood firm.<br>At the other end, Rangers were shooting themselves in the foot as Alfredo Morelos was foolishly and consistently caught offside. Then, when the striker was through in the 16th minute, he was denied by Jozo Simunovic. There were appeals for a penalty but Thomson kept matters moving.<br>Roberts was dancing past players at the other end but still the end product was lacking from Celtic. Griffiths came close in the 23rd minute but, after bringing a long ball down on his chest, his strike on the turn was saved by Foderingham.<br>With things getting meatier in the midfield, Graham Dorrans took joy in turning both Scott Brown and Roberts but his 25-yard shot was wayward.<br>The in-rushing Morelos was inches from stealing a lead in the 31st minute but couldn&rsquo;t quite get to James Tavernier&rsquo;s long ball to the back post.<br>The frustration for the guests was that it took until the 50th minute for them to finally break through. It came from a scrappy corner which Rangers couldn&rsquo;t clear and it was Rogic who reacted to finally send the ball high into Foderingham&rsquo;s net.<br>But the game was far from done. A Celtic fan was huckled away after a flare was thrown on to the pitch and narrowly missed the Rangers keeper, while Morelos forced a fantastic, reaction save from Craig Gordon at point-blank range in the 55th minute. The striker then flattened him in a later challenge.<br>But the key moment came in the 65th minute when Griffiths scored the second. It offered Rangers no way back.<br><br><br><br>Rangers boss Pedro Caixinha hits out at Scott Brown for &lsquo;elbow&rsquo;<br>Celtic&#39;s Scott Brown exchanges words with Rangers manager Pedro Caixinha.

If someone does nothing, I have to defend my club, my players and the truth of the game.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the referee&rsquo;s decision. If he doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an action to get booked or sent off, it&rsquo;s his decision. I need to respect it.<br>&ldquo;If I was a player and I had to face Brown or players like him, it would be a different thing. It was a shame that I couldn&rsquo;t play because I know the mentality I have.&rdquo;<br>Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers admitted he did not see the incident but praised referee Craig Thompson for his handling of the powder-keg clash.<br>&ldquo;I thought it was a competitive game,&rdquo; said the Northern Irishman. &ldquo;It was aggressive and you want it aggressive.<br>&ldquo;But I think we need to give a mention to the referee as well because he was excellent.&rdquo;<br>&bull; READ MORE: Watch Leigh Griffiths pick his nose and wipe it on Rangers flag<br>Rodgers had every reason to be happy with his side&rsquo;s work as they marked 500 days since their last domestic defeat.<br>They were pushed all the way during the opening half but when Tom Rogic swept the visitors ahead five minutes into the second period, their victory was set.<br>Griffiths then managed to slip away from Gers&rsquo; teenage debutant Ross McCroie for the first time all afternoon to slot home the second on 66 minutes as the Hoops once again underlined their dominance over their Old Firm rivals.<br>&ldquo;I thought defensively we were outstanding in terms of our pressing and denying them the opportunity to play,&rdquo; said Rodgers.<br>&ldquo;In games here you have to defend well and have good organisation.<br>&ldquo;In the second half, our conditioning and quality of our players came through. It was a very, very good performance. There was a great atmosphere here today and our boys coped with it well.&rdquo;<br>Caixinha admitted Gers&rsquo; second-half errors and a stunning reflex save by Craig Gordon from Morelos&rsquo; point-blank range header in the moments after Rogic&rsquo;s opener cost his side.<br>&ldquo;The team who made the least mistakes won today,&rdquo; said the Portuguese coach. &ldquo;They were better than us as the game went on, definitely.<br>&ldquo;We tried to take the game in the direction we wanted. In the first half, it was a good football match.<br>&ldquo;But two moments were crucial. The first was how we lost the opening goal and the second was not equalising when Morelos had the chance.&rdquo;<br>Celtic now hold an eight-point lead over their old foes but Caixinha has thrown down the gauntlet to his men.<br>He said: &ldquo;We need to focus on the next match because now we&rsquo;re going to see what we&rsquo;re made of. Now we&rsquo;ll see if we react the way we need to or just look around and don&rsquo;t take decisions.&rdquo;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br>Second-half goals from Tom Rogic and Leigh Griffiths eased Celtic to victory over Rangers at Ibrox.<br><br>The win extended Celtic&#39;s lead in the Premiership over their Old Firm rivals to eight points and their run of unbeaten domestic games to 57.<br><br>Rangers survived an early flurry but could not prevent Rogic opening the scoring just after the break when he pounced on a loose ball to drive home.<br><br>Griffiths added the second when he converted Patrick Roberts&#39;
