Celtic were formed in 1888 by Irish Catholic immigrants to raise funds to alleviate poverty in the city&#39;s East End.         To this day, most Celtic fans come from a Catholic background, while the majority of Rangers fans are Protestants.   Controversial match<br><br>Last month an ill-tempered Scottish Cup clash between the two sides led to political intervention.<br><br>         The match saw three red cards, several touch-line and tunnel confrontations and 34 arrests inside Celtic Park and 187 outside.<br><br>         After the final whistle, Mr Lennon and Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist were involved in a confrontation.<br><br><div class="audioInStoryC">          	             </div>         Strathclyde  Police requested a Scottish government-led summit  after describing  scenes at the game, which Celtic won 1-0, as  &quot;shameful&quot;.<br>         Both clubs subsequently agreed to an action plan to tackle Old Firm-related disorder.<br><br>         The  fallout from the controversial match continued, however,  when the  Celtic manager subsequently received a ban for his actions.<br><br>         McCoist  had an initial two-match ban overturned, while two of  his players,  El-Hadji Diouf and Madjid Bougherra, were fined over their  actions  after the sendings off.<br>         This prompted highly-critical comments from Mr McBride towards the SFA.<br><br>         The advocate accused the organisation of being &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;biased&quot;.<br><br>         In response the governing body described the QC&#39;s remarks as &quot;wild&quot; and &quot;inaccurate&quot; and threatened to sue for defamation.<br><br>         The BBC understands there have since been moves by both sides to resolve the matter out of court.               	 	</div>      <div>  	 	     </div>           <div class="share-body-bottom"> 	    </div>    	     		     <div class="hyperpuff"> 	       	            		 	       	           	       	               	       	     </div> 	             	   	     </div>    	 	</div>  	 </div>       	 	           <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Rangers v Celtic: dangerous fires of hatred kindled by words spoken in haste 		 	</h3>Telegraph April 2011<br><br> If it were not for the fact that the reality so obviously exceeds the analogy,    one might observe that the story of the devices mailed to Neil Lennon, Paul    McBride and Trish Godman was an item to be handled as delicately a suspect    package. Perhaps it is still worth saying as much.</div></div>          	 	                           <div> <div>   </div> </div> <div>  <div class="blq-lang-en-GB blq-gvl-3"> <div>     <div class="blq-clearfix">  	                                  		<div class="glasgow-and-west  has-no-ticker"> 			<div> 				 			      			      				  <div class="firstPar"> As is now well known, Strathclyde Police asked for a voluntary news blackout    when reporters first contacted them to confirm that the <a class="external" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/celtic/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Celtic</a>    manager had been targeted by a mail bomber. Both this correspondent and this    newspaper were party to the agreement, on the explicit understanding that -    in a world where the merest wisp of a rumour is liable to be rendered as    absolute fact via the alchemy of blogs and Tweets - such a self-denying    ordinance might not be sustainable for long. </div><div class="secondPar">  It goes against all the instincts of a trained journalist to hold back on a    story, especially when it is news that is guaranteed to be of immense    interest far beyond the usual boundaries of a localised football rivalry,    however intense.<br><br> Speaking from the point of view of a newspaperman who has    worked for daily papers since I was in my teens, I can testify that when a    journalist breaks a big story, the mingling of satisfaction and euphoria is    much the same as the exultation a striker experiences from scoring yet    another match-winning goal. </div><div class="thirdPar">  In this instance, the police had asked for time to pursue their investigation    for two reasons - one being to reduce the chance that the would-be bomber&rsquo;s    actions could spawn imitators and the other being to maintain as calm an    atmosphere as possible until this Sunday&rsquo;s Old Firm league derby at Ibrox    could be got safely out of the way. </div><div class="fourthPar">  Sometimes when such requests are made, scepticism - that invaluable journalistic    instinct - comes to the fore. &ldquo;The cops haven&rsquo;t a clue and are    playing for time,&rdquo; is a common thought.</div><div class="fifthPar">  And there are episodes when such disbelief is entirely justified. On other    occasions - this being one, it was judged by those who were asked to hold    back on the story - there was a powerful case for a degree of restraint. In    a season which has featured six Old Firm derbies already, the accumulation    of these collisions has generated a crackling in the air.</div> 	<div class="related_links_inline"></div> 	<div class="body">  Common sense might insist that it would be in the interests of civil order -    as well as that of others who might be targeted by whoever is sending the    devices - to do nothing to prompt the thundercloud to break. However, as I    say, embargoes on such stories are always fragile and, in this case it was    surprising that silence was actually maintained until the middle of this    week. <br><br>  Now the Old Firm must engage in a contest at Ibrox on Sunday, played out    before 52,000 spectators who are fully aware that, but for the vigilance of    others, the Celtic manager has been the target of a device intended to leave    him injured, maimed or even dead. <br><br>  Between now and the game there will be pleas for the fans to exercise restraint.    Such requests might also be extended to those who have rushed to hang their    agendas on this game like so many coats on a shaky peg. <br><br>  At the time of writing, we do not know who is responsible for these packages    or where they originate. And despite the fact that the intended recipients    are linked by the fact that they are all prominently connected to Celtic in    one way or another, we cannot be sure of the motive for targeting them. <br><br>  One would assume that it is very likely to be sectarian in nature, of course,    and the product of a profoundly warped individual but, if precedent is any    guide, the chances are that he - and it is almost certain to be a male    perpetrator - is sitting alone at a kitchen table or in a garden shed,    inexpertly assembling his menacing devices. <br><br>  He might have a football allegiance or he might not. He could have nurtured    some long-standing grievance that has festered into hatred or perhaps some    recent, unfathomable event might have tipped him into a rage - what, after    all, had a class of five-year-olds at Dunblane Primary School done to Thomas    Hamilton to provoke his rampage? <br><br>  Whatever the truth, everything else is guesswork at the moment and it is    always worth repeating that inflammatory statements or assumptions can do    more damage than an explosive parcel that is intercepted before it reaches    its target. <br><br>  At any event, we have been here before and in much bloodier circumstances. On    March 19, 1988 two British Army corporals found their car marooned in the    funeral procession of an IRA volunteer. <br><br>  In one of the most bestial and harrowing incidents of the Troubles, they were    dragged from their vehicle, beaten almost senseless and then stabbed and    shot to death, a scene played out on national news bulletins with footage    from an Army helicopter. <br><br>  The next day Rangers    were due to play Celtic at Ibrox and - the fixture being played on a Sunday    with large contingents travelling from Northern Ireland to support both    sides &ndash; there were fears that very serious violence might erupt at the    game. <br><br>  I got to the stadium four hours before kick-off while bomb squad sniffer dogs    were being guided through the stands. The atmosphere, however, far from    being tense and incendiary, was notably muted. <br><br>  Celtic won 2-1 - and went on to take the title in the club&rsquo;s centenary year    - after what was, by common consent, one of the quietest Glasgow derbies in    years. <br><br>  In these past few weeks a twisted perception of the world has been visited on    three public figures in Scotland.   The most encouraging outcome on Sunday would be that - as in 1988 - a saner    reality will impose itself on 52,000 people aware that acting out a tribal    rivalry is not at all the same as pursuing it to what would be a very bitter    end.</div></div></div></div></div>  </div> </div>             	              <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>22 April 2011 Last updated at 02:16     	     Paul McBride attacks Celtic bomb &#39;terrorists and thugs&#39;                                		 		                          	                       </h3><div class="layout-block-a"><div class="blq-rst blq-clearfix blq-foot-transparent blq-foot-text-dark">The  Celtic-supporting QC targeted in a parcel bomb campaign has said those  responsible are not football fans but &quot;terrorists, thugs and cowards&quot;.<br><br>Paul McBride said a &quot;vocal minority&quot; stir up sectarian hate  in Scotland and has called for tougher jail terms for those who use the  internet to do so.<br><br>Mr McBride said he was &quot;coping perfectly well&quot; following the incident.<br><br>Parcel bombs were also sent to Celtic manager Neil Lennon and former Labour MSP Trish Godman.<br><br>On Thursday night a vigil outside Celtic Park in support of  the manager was attended by about 2,000 people, according to a statement  from the club.<br><br>A message of support on Facebook stated: &quot;Enough is enough, Neil Lennon has long been a target of sectarian bigots.<br><br>&quot;It is time for a public show of support for Neil and to send the bigots a clear message.&quot;<br><br>In a BBC interview, Mr McBride said: &quot;It looks like anyone  who&#39;s a high profile supporter of Celtic or has been vocal in their  support of the difficulties faced by Neil Lennon has become a target  these days.<br>&quot;These people out there are not football fans.

This was agreed to and at a  meeting being held at Strathclyde Police headquarters on Monday 19 April  those present agreed to hold off until Wednesday 20 April.<br> 	<br> 	It is now understood that on the same day First Minister Alex Salmond  also contacted editors to thank them for agreeing to the embargo and ask  them to either hold firm or extend it.<br> 	<br> 	A further conference call was then held by the editors at midday on  Tuesday 20 April, where it was decided that it was in the public  interest to warn Celtic fans of the potential risk they faced It was  also agreed that no prosecution was imminent and that the embargo was  likely to fall. The story was subsequently reported that evening,  quickly developing into an international story the next day.<br> 	<br> 	As to the First Minister&rsquo;s involvement, a spokesperson for the  Government, commented: &ldquo;As an indication of the seriousness with which  we view these matters, the Cabinet sub-committee met last Saturday to  ensure that the police investigation had every possible support to come  to a successful conclusion. The news media were subsequently contacted  and asked not to report the incidents at that point to avoid prejudicing  the police investigation.&rdquo;<br><br>  	Said one commentator close to the talks, &quot;It is very unusual for the  First Minister to get involved at this level, especially so because he  was requesting the media not to cover an issue. His intervention, even  in light of the seriousness of this matter raised a a few eyebrows.&quot;<br> 	<br> 	Yesterday, Shorthouse discussed the situation surrounding the voluntary media embargo and  thanked those involved for their co-operation, describing the situation  as &lsquo;unique&rsquo; and added that he appreciated that it was a difficult story  for the media to sit on. </div> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3> Neil Lennon is no quitter but this time it goes beyond him 	  </h3>             Wednesday, 20 April 2011<br>A parcel bomb was sent to Neil Lennon<br><br>       <div class="articleRelated">                      </div> <div class="articleRelated">              </div>     <div class="body">          <b>Jim Gracey on how Celtic boss will respond to latest threat now the danger    level and risk to others has risen</b><b><br><br></b>   Bombs and bullets were never far away, growing up in Lurgan in the worst of    times. How ironic they never affected the young, unknown Neil Lennon who    carried on playing football on the streets of the nationalist Taghnevan    estate while mayhem often reigned around. <br><br>  Now, at the peak of his fame and success, the terror and tribalism he thought    he&#39;d risen above and left behind have returned to haunt him. <br><br>  I&#39;ve known Neil since he was a raw, 16-year-old kid, trying to make his way as    an apprentice at a much less cash-rich and fashionable Manchester City than    they are now. <br><br>  And he has always been a fighter, overcoming adversity every step of the way    to become a top player and now manager. <br><br>  Doubts over his ability to even carve a career in professional football; a    crippling back injury that threatened to wreck his dreams, dark bouts of    depression, upheaval in his private life, and now this. <br><br>  Bullets in the post, while frightening and intimidating, pose no physical    threat. But a parcel bomb capable of causing injury? <br><br>  That&#39;s taken the vicious and insidious campaign against his person to a level    never before seen in British football. <br><br>  It has moved from downright nasty and unpleasant to sinister, the latest twist    amounting to terrorism. <br><br>  If there was ambivalance before, a tendency to regard the hounding of Lennon    as a manifestion of the prejudices of the worst types steeped in historic    Old Firm bigotry, an exercise in publicity-seeking from which no real harm    would come &mdash; and even that is to ignore the strain placed on Lennon and his    family &mdash; then it is time to think again. <br><br>  Those responsible require a response from the law in proportion to their    actions . . . they are no different to the fanatics posing a threat in the    name of a different religion. They need to be taken as seriously and similar    security resources applied to tracking them down. <br><br>  You can go to jail for as much as joking about a bomb at an airport... a real    one in the post demands likewise. <br><br>  But what of Neil Lennon? Can he handle it? How will he handle it? The Lenny I    know would never shirk from a fight or a threat to his own person. He&#39;d meet    it head-on, as fiery red-heads of his ilk tend to do, with no thought for    himself. <br><br>  But these are unseen enemies he cannot confront. <br><br>  And when the safety of family and friends is also endangered, he will consider    that a different matter entirely. <br><br>  It would go against every Neil Lennon grain to back down; to walk away from    his dream job, at the behest of shadowy cowards not fit to lace his boots    and who most certainly would not tackle him face to face. <br><br>  What Lenny will look for is not so much a guarantee of his own safety but that    those closest to him are not also at risk. <br><br>  His decisions and future as Celtic manager hinge on the answers. All those who    know and respect Lenny will vouch that he isn&#39;t the type to be cowed. <br><br>  They will hope he carries on, not least to see his managerial ambitions    fulfilled, and so that those who resort to threats and terror do not win, a    mindset of which we are all too familiar. <br><br>  It&rsquo;s a convenient attitude to accept when you are not in the firing line. When    your nearest and dearest become the collateral damage, no job is worth the    candle. <br><br>  That is what the Neil Lennon I know is now weighing up.   </div> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>Police swoop on Old Firm internet hate suspects in dawn raids </h3>Apr 24 2011 Exclusive by Lauren Crooks, Sunday Mail <br><br><br>THIS  is the moment when police seized a suspect accused of the internet hate  campaign against bomb-threat Celtic boss Neil Lennon.<br><br>Officers  swooped on the home of Stephen Birrell, 27, in a dawn raid yesterday as  they hunt the bigots posting sinister threats and abuse on message  boards.<br><br>He was led away in handcuffs from the house as officers seized his mobile phone and laptop computer.<br><br>A specialist unit - which usually targets online gang activity - carried out the raid in Dalmarnock, Glasgow.<br><br>They  also arrested David Craig, 23, at a house in Paisley as they move  against a list of 50 suspects accused of posting vile bigotry on the  web.<br><br>Unit boss Super intendent Kirk Kinnell warned: &quot;You have nowhere to hide.<br><br>&quot;At both locations we recovered mobile phones and laptops.

But, even given this context, Wednesday night&rsquo;s attack on the Celtic manager by a supporter at Tynecastle will remain a shocking and vivid reminder of what Lennon is having to deal with in Glasgow.<br><br> For those of us covering the match it was all the more startling, given that the Tynecastle pressbox is right behind the technical areas. Out of nowhere this big, lumbering bruiser came hurtling from the enclosure towards Lennon, grabbing the Celtic manager and attempting to assault him. Police, stewards and others frantically ran to intervene, while Lennon did his level best to exact his own revenge on his assailant.<br><br> It was a shocking moment, in a shocking season for Scottish football. It also only reinforced a very ugly impression that, for a number of different and dubious reasons, Lennon remains someone whom many in Scotland love to hate.<br><br> It would be wearying to go back over all the threats he has had to deal with. But the upshot of Wednesday&rsquo;s attack, on top of the bullets, parcel bombs and other packages sent his way, must surely make Lennon and Celtic think again about whether it is worth it having him in place as the club&rsquo;s manager.<br><br> For some, the sheer poison that accompanies Lennon being in the Celtic job is now getting too much. Might the club now say, enough is enough, we need to protect this guy and take him out of the firing line? Or might Lennon, even for his family&rsquo;s sake, let alone his own, conclude that it is time to demit office?<br><br> I don&rsquo;t believe Lennon, even now, will walk away from Celtic. He loves his job, and the club and its supporters adore him. And, maybe in a perverse kind of way, Lennon remains largely unfazed by what is going on around him. His focus on the Celtic job is remarkable, and he certainly doesn&rsquo;t appear to be scared. He is, however, perfectly entitled to be.<br><br> It would be a wretched commentary on Scottish football and Scotland in general were Lennon to leave Celtic because of this lunacy in our midst. If this is the point we have reached &mdash; a football manager resigning due to threats to his life &mdash; then Scottish society must have arrived at a very dark place. And this is to say nothing, were Lennon to walk away, of the unspeakable victory it would hand to those who carry out these deeds.<br><br> Some, rightly, have been citing Lennon&rsquo;s own personality amid all of this. That topic is not irrelevant, given the effect it has on those who want to use violence as their means of expression.<br><br> Lennon is no shirker. He is no shrinking violet. He stands his ground, in verbal or physical argument. He is also provocative. In recent weeks he has shown a propensity to shoot from the lip, in a way that most other managers would shy away from.<br><br> Lennon&rsquo;s comments, for instance, about other teams&rsquo; lack of effort against Rangers in the race for the title flag this weekend, have irked quite a few fans and coaches beyond the Celtic faithful.<br><br> And yet no one, surely, could cite any of this as an excuse for what has happened to Lennon.<br><br> Twenty-five years ago a young Graeme Souness became the player-manager of Rangers and in many ways was just as outspoken as Lennon. Souness revelled in mouthing off about other clubs, referees and about the SFA. Like Lennon, he had a cockiness and an arrogance about him.<br><br> But Souness never got sent parcel bombs or bullets. He never became the subject of death threats or physical assaults, such as what we witnessed at Tynecastle the other night. This has been a poison that has almost exclusively been reserved for Lennon.<br><br> Bigotry is never far from people&rsquo;s lips in this situation, but that word also has to be used carefully in the current context. Scotland is not a country riven by bigotry &mdash; we should say that emphatically. Moreover, the attack on Lennon in Edinburgh was most likely not a sectarian-fuelled attack. This will be established soon enough, but it looked more like a Heart of Midlothian fan nursing an insane and deep-seated dislike of Lennon.<br><br> But the old rule applies: what bigots we do have in Scotland are given a handy stage by the Old Firm on which to perform. Scottish football has provided an excuse and an arena for undesirables to go about their business.<br><br> And, whether it is due to religious or racial prejudice, or sheer physical malice, Neil Lennon remains the most persistent target.  <br><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Neil Lennon would be forgiven for walking away after Hearts attack4</h3><div>may 2011, The Guardian<br><br>source: http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/may/12/neil-lennon-celtic-abuse<br><br>After the Tynecastle assault just how much more can Neil Lennon take as Celtic&#39;s manager?</div><div> 	    &quot;The fact I walk out on to a football pitch seems to provoke a  lot of people.

It is too early now to say how Neil  will react.&quot;<br><br>Levels of antagonism surrounding matches between  Hearts and Celtic have increased markedly, with events at Tynecastle the  only indicator needed that such sentiment has gone too far.<br><br>&quot;There  was a funny atmosphere, a bit of hostility,&quot; acknowledged the Hearts  manager, Jim Jefferies, of the Tynecastle scene even before Lennon was  targeted in such a high-profile manner.<br><br>Hearts had nothing to play  for in the Scottish Premier League game &ndash; third place for them had been  secured 24 hours before Celtic&#39;s visit &ndash; and as the visitors cantered  towards victory there seemed to be little to rile someone sitting in the  stands.<br><br>Yet the visit of Celtic for some reason brings out the  worst elements of the Edinburgh club&#39;s support, with Lennon a focal  point for their animosity. In his playing days, Lennon was vociferously  taunted by Hearts fans &ndash; as, equally, have several Rangers players been  down the years &ndash; with one punter landing on top of a dug-out in an  attempt to &quot;get to&quot; the then-Celtic captain.<br><br>Tynecastle has never been a tranquil place, but Hearts have been shamed by last night&#39;s trouble.<br><br>Lennon  has a straightforward theory about why he is subject to loathing at  every apparent turn. That is, he is a high-profile Roman Catholic in  Scotland; sufficient motivation for abuse to rain down on him at  football grounds across the country.<br><br>The simplicity of that  argument renders it useful but others have received no such attention.  Lennon, moreover, was not singled out in such a consistent way during a  generally successful time as a Celtic player. Despite being assaulted in  a Glasgow street in 2008, the irony is that Lennon spoke of missing the  city when he briefly departed, for spells at Nottingham Forest and  Wycombe Wanderers.<br><br>Lennon&#39;s touchline manner often does not lend  itself to peace and tranquillity but no reasonable person can argue that  what the Celtic manager has had to deal with this season has not gone  beyond reasonable grounds.<br><br>From bullets in the post to viable  explosive devices, Lennon has had to encounter more security episodes  than anybody ever involved in the Scottish game. Earlier this week, it  was revealed that seven arrests had been made outside Celtic&#39;s training  centre after a gun alert.<br><br>The common denominator in such matters  is Lennon. Football matters routinely dictate whether a manager remains  in post into a new campaign; at Celtic, there is a wider and more  dangerous issue at stake. Someone, somewhere, has got to draw a line in  the sand.     </div><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>     Why is this man so hated?  </h3>By Roddy Forsyth, Irish Indie<br><br>Friday May 13 2011<br><br>What is it about Neil Lennon that incites people to acts that effectively amount to terrorism? <br><br>Even in casual conversation, one hears extraordinarily polarised opinions about him, like this, yesterday, from one of Lennon&#39;s Northern Irish compatriots: &quot;Sure, he&#39;s a cheeky b*****d -- the kind of kid you&#39;d slap in the playground.&quot;<br><br>Lennon, though, is not the target of metaphorical smacks, but of real and vicious assaults in the street, packets of live bullets (another bullet arrived at Celtic Park yesterday, addressed to the manager) and, most recently, a nail bomb, which would have found its way to him via the mail had it not been for the vigilance of others along its route.<br><br>And let us not forget the death threats expressed through graffiti at his family home, anonymous telephone calls and truly disgusting website images. Now we have come to the stage where any fan of an opposing club, at any ground at any time, has to be considered a potential assailant.<br><br>That&#39;s the way the American <a class="external" href="http://searchtopics.independent.ie/topic/Secret_Service" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Secret Service</a> operates around the US president and it is astounding to think that it is what will have to happen with Lennon if the unfathomable rage against him continues unabated. Too far-fetched? <br><br>Well, Hearts -- or whoever was in charge of security at Tynecastle -- must have thought so, otherwise there would have been some semblance of a protective cordon around the Celtic manager.<br><br>Meanwhile, it was put to me on breakfast radio yesterday morning that &quot;many people would say he (Lennon) brings it on himself?&quot; I don&#39;t doubt for a moment that many people do, partly because the Celtic manager has engaged in some very public confrontations this season.<br><br>One has only to think back to Tynecastle in November, when Celtic lost 2-0 and Lennon treated the fourth official and the referee to a barrage of abuse so vitriolic that he was not only sent to the stand but charged with excessive misconduct. <br><br>Then there was the angry square-up to <a class="external" href="http://searchtopics.independent.ie/topic/Ally_McCoist" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ally McCoist</a> in full view of the TV cameras at the end of the Scottish Cup replay with Rangers at Parkhead on March 2, for which Lennon subsequently apologised, saying that he had fallen below the standards expected of a Celtic manager.<br><br><br>Revealed<br><br>And, days after it was revealed that an explosive package had been intercepted en route to him, and 1,000 extra police deployed on the streets of <a class="external" href="http://searchtopics.independent.ie/topic/Glasgow" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Glasgow</a>, he could not resist cupping his ears in a sarcastic gesture of defiance of the Rangers fans who were vociferously taunting him at full-time. <br><br>Taken together, there is the basis of an indictment against him for incendiary behaviour -- and not necessarily of the heedless sort.<br><br><br>After all, it was Lennon himself who said -- echoed in comments by his assistant Johan Mjallby -- that he &quot;knew what he was doing&quot; at times when others concluded that he had let temper get the better of reason. <br><br>Furthermore, Lennon made it clear when he took over from <a class="external" href="http://searchtopics.independent.ie/topic/Tony_Mowbray" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Tony Mowbray</a> that he thought his predecessor had been far too docile in his pitchside manner.<br><br>So, if there is a calculating element to some of his antics, the Parkhead manager has to accept that there will be consequences, including condemnation. <br><br>As one former Celtic manager remarked recently: &quot;He still has to understand that everything he does is scrutinised and can and will be used against him.&quot;<br><br>Yet, at what point does Lennon&#39;s behaviour diverge from the common run of competitive frustration or even the familiar combative and manipulative actions of managers at the very pinnacle of the game -- think of Jose Mourinho and Alex Ferguson? Frankly, it doesn&#39;t.<br><br>Were Lennon in charge at, say, <a class="external" href="http://searchtopics.independent.ie/topic/Crewe_Alexandra" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Crewe Alexandra</a> or Leicester City, two of the clubs for whom he played before he made the fateful decision to follow Martin O&#39;Neill to Celtic, there would likely be a certain critique of his style -- it might even be thought of as admirably committed, if sometimes a tad excessive -- but nothing like the cyclone of antagonism it generates when witnessed in Scotland.<br><br>Lennon recently ventured the opinion that the relentless torrent of opprobrium directed his way was purely and simply because he is an Irish Catholic in charge of Celtic. <br><br>The contrast that immediately sprang to mind was with O&#39;Neill, whose credentials were identical but who was on the receiving end of nothing more harmful in his private life than the occasional barbed comment from Rangers fans.<br><br><br>Yet the two men are perceived in fundamentally varying ways: O&#39;Neill the technically fluent midfielder in <a class="external" href="http://searchtopics.independent.ie/topic/Brian_Clough" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Brian Clough</a>&#39;s elegant Nottingham Forest side; Lennon the gladiatorial, sometimes snarling ball-winner for O&#39;Neill at Celtic.<br><br><br>There is a more fundamental difference -- almost primordial -- between the pair. O&#39;Neill is urbane, ironic and subtle. Lennon is vividly expressive and rough hewn.<br><br><br>In fact, Lennon&#39;s face bears a startling resemblance to that of Vincent Van Gogh in the artist&#39;s late self-portraits. It is a visual paradox that Lennon should bear such a likeness to the son of a Dutch Protestant pastor that they could easily pass as brothers.<br><br>Yet he hasn&#39;t actually won anything yet. What in God&#39;s name can we expect if he manages to establish Celtic as the dominant force in Scottish football?<br><br>We cannot retreat from the possibility that the ambition that animates Lennon most could unleash a reaction too dangerous for him and his family to contemplate. <br><br>What manager could take that risk?

The time  has come for Little Bill to answer for his brutal reign of terror. He  crumbles. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deserve this&hellip; I was building a house.&rdquo;<br> Rangers aren&rsquo;t quite building a house. They are trying to sell one.  The &lsquo;imminent&rsquo; takeover featuring Craig Whyte (a proposed takeover that  provides more questions than answers to Rangers&rsquo; woes) has been dragging  on for some weeks now. The gorilla in the room, as Chairman Alistair  Johnston put it, revolves around the HMRC case and who gets lumbered  with the potential liability of anything between &pound;15M and &pound;90M over the  dangerous practice of using Employee Benefit Trust (EBT) payments,  according to the varying speculated figures.<br> Yet, it seems that Rangers have more gorillas in their midst. On  Thursday it emerged that UEFA intend to lay additional charges of  sectarian songs and chants at the club, this time in their home game  against PSV Eindhoven. The club were already preparing their defence  against allegations of sectarian chanting in the away leg. The term &lsquo;allegations&rsquo; is used loosely in this sense, because the  club and their supporters&rsquo; representatives have already admitted that  sectarian chanting occurred at these fixtures. So, while you have on one  hand an acceptance of guilt, Chief Executive Martin Bain continues to  use the phrase &lsquo;alleged sectarian chanting&rsquo;.<br> He has once again, assumed Rangers&rsquo; seemingly default position as being one of outrage. There is a campaign against Rangers. Someone has &lsquo;grassed&rsquo; on us? We demand to know who it was. Other clubs do it too. If such a mentality was applied to everyday life, we might as well open the jails and let everyone walk free.<br> Considering it&rsquo;s an accusation the fans have levelled at their city  rivals for years, it&rsquo;s ironic how quickly Rangers have taken to the role  of persecuted victim. Many aspects of life at Ibrox at present may have  unfavourable implications, but the club has been excused sanction for  their fans behaviour for so long that, when they are faced with the  reality of repercussions for persistent misdemeanours, they throw their  hands up in horror. Why? Why us? Why now?<br> In his statement, Bain has admitted the problem exists. He says that  &ldquo;We have never said that sectarian singing is not a problem&rdquo;. He  further states, &ldquo;We could not have done more to eradicate sectarian  behaviour.&rdquo;<br> Could they have done more? Manager Walter Smith&rsquo;s statement last week  asking for fans to stop singing sectarian songs seemed to fudge the  issue. He thought that &lsquo;in a modern era it is maybe unacceptable&rdquo; for  the fans to sing sectarian songs, which he seemed to intimate were part  of a &lsquo;great tradition&rsquo;. The urgency to stop referred to the possibility  that Rangers could &lsquo;suffer drastic consequences&rsquo; and that they should  &lsquo;take into account the problems the club have&rsquo; and stop singing them.<br> Is that unequivocal? Certainly, Martin Bain was more forthright. He  said that the club&rsquo;s position on sectarian singing &lsquo;had been made time  and time again. We condemn it.&rsquo;<br> At last, a straightforward condemnation. But why did they only make  such a statement after UEFA were again involved? Did no one hear the  singing at the recent League Cup final from the alleged small minority?  Alleged is used here because, to this ear, it sounded like the vast  majority of Rangers&rsquo; support was up to its knees in Fenian blood at  several points in the game, while a host of other ditties, mentioning  chapels, rosary beads, and the Pope also got an airing.<br> The philosophical question asks, if a tree falls in the woods and no  one is around, does it make a noise? Similarly, if 20,000 Rangers fans  sing sectarian songs when there are no UEFA delegates at the game, do  they expect no one to hear it? Certainly the Justice Minister Kenny  MacAskill didn&rsquo;t seem to hear it or, if he did, he didn&rsquo;t seem to mind.  But just because MacAskill provided a glowing reference, it shouldn&rsquo;t  have stopped Rangers from taking a stand on their own initiative. It  might have counted for something, in their efforts to tackle the  problem.<br> The club &lsquo;has tried everything in its power to eradicate sectarianism&rsquo;.<br> Is that the case? To those viewing Rangers from afar, it seems the  club operates on a nod and a wink with its supporters. It is small  wonder, therefore, that some of them fail to understand why they are now  admonished for behaviour that they have always indulged in (indeed,  some of which has been enjoyed by boardroom members). And in the  corridors of independent arbitrary power, the same nod and a wink  enabled Rangers to operate without sanction, with the SFA unable and/or  unwilling to put a halt to it. Indeed SFA chief Stewart Regan&rsquo;s  statement last night spoke of &lsquo;dismay&rsquo; and how the &lsquo;fans had let the  club down on the night&rsquo;. UEFA opened a door for Regan to demand Rangers  fans cease polluting domestic football grounds with their bile, yet he  failed to walk through it.<br> The SFA chief is relatively new to Scotland, but he can&rsquo;t be unaware  of what is sung at every game Rangers play in or, indeed, the background  to the case. Rangers were just like any other Scottish football club  until they embarked on a policy of religious discrimination that lasted  for eight full decades, until Maurice Johnston signed for them in 1989.  Since then, they have been like any other equal opportunities employer.  They sign and employ people regardless of their race, religion or  colour. It had been hoped that after Johnston signed, there would be a  dilution of the bigotry from the stands. The fans were later to see an  Italian Catholic club captain and a Catholic manager of the club. For  some of the fans who burned their season tickets when Johnston signed,  these two acts must have been the culmination of all their fears when  the club allowed a Catholic &lsquo;in the door&rsquo; on that infamous day.<br> Football, however, is a business and any business must know its  market, so Rangers still had to appeal to their large, core support.  Over these last 22 years, since Johnston signed, the club have sold  &lsquo;sash&rsquo; jerseys, orange away tops, removed eggs Benedict from their menus  after the current Pope&rsquo;s succession, sold dinner menus priced at  &pound;16.90, and allegedly had a sash design cut into the Ibrox turf by  grounds staff. Some of these could easily be dismissed as a bit of a  laugh amongst like-minded people, but another way of seeing it would be  that this type of &lsquo;banter&rsquo; is simply the thin end of the wedge.<br> The thick end sees the attraction of extremist supporters who have  verbally and physically assaulted Celtic manager Neil Lennon &ndash; a  Catholic from Northern Ireland &ndash; leaving him unconscious in the street,  and he and his family under the type of 24-hour protection normally  reserved for a Cabinet minister. In case anyone is under the illusion it  is a response to Lennon&rsquo;s perceived personality, two Northern Irish  Catholics playing for Celtic also received death threats in the form of  bullets through the post, two quieter footballers it would be hard to  imagine in Scotland. On top of all that, Lennon has also had bomb  threats intercepted and his family has had to be moved to a safe house.  None of this has met with a comment or condemnation from Rangers, the  only club who stand to gain from these heinous crimes from the more  extreme of their supporters, which at the very least are a heavy  distraction to Lennon and Celtic.<br> If they did indeed have any dignity, they might wish to follow the  lead of former Celtic chairman Bob Kelly, who had stated that Celtic  would withdraw from the Scottish Cup rather than profit from the actions  of fans who had thrown bottles on to the pitch in an unsuccessful bid  to get a game abandoned and replayed. This might lead to a swift  resolution to what has been the most dreadful stain on Scottish football  because, if these threats drive out any of the Celtic staff targeted,  will it be Scottish Catholics playing for Celtic who are targeted next  or, for that matter, anyone else who they take a dislike to?<br> For Rangers to eradicate sectarian singing and, more ominously, the  type of fan who has involved himself in the persistent attacks on  Lennon, they should release a statement saying that, while they had  those sectarian policies in the past, not only do they no longer abide  by them (as seen by their existing equal opportunities employment  policy) but they recognise that those discriminatory policies were  abhorrent and they wish to apologise as a club to the section of the  community who were slighted by them.<br> The police service, the ambulance service, the fire service, and the  NHS have all admitted to institutional bias and have apologised for it.  Rangers, as the self-proclaimed &lsquo;second most important institution in  Scotland&rsquo; should follow suit. They may well lose many of their core  support, but they might finally come out the other side as a club with a  broader appeal than that which they have already. They certainly have  nothing, in the long term, to lose.<br> Until Rangers themselves extinguish the smouldering embers of  sectarianism at their club, there is always the danger that the flames  will once again erupt and the house that they have built will be damaged  beyond repair. 									</div> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>     Two men guilty of &#39;bomb plot&#39; against Celtic boss Neil Lennon<br>BBC<br>The pair were found to have plotted to assault the manager and other high-profile supporters of the club.<br><br>30 March 2012 15:20 GMT<br><br> Comment (1)<br><br>Two men have been convicted of plotting to send fake nail bombs to Celtic manager Neil Lennon and other prominent supporters of the club.<br><br>Trevor Muirhead, 44, and Neil McKenzie, 42, were found guilty of conspiracy to asault after they constructed packages marked for Lennon, the late QC Paul McBride and ex-MSP Trish Godman.<br><br>McKenzie was also found guilty of dispatching an item to Lennon at Celtic Park with the intention of inducing him to believe it would &quot;explode or ignite&quot;.

This was not about football - it was an act of violence against Scottish society as a whole, and impacted across the UK.&quot;<br><br>Detective Chief Superintendent John Cuddihy said Strathclyde Police was &quot;satisfied&quot; with the verdict and called the pair&#39;s actions &quot;cowardly&quot;<br><br>He said: &quot;Muirhead and McKenzie have been found guilty of the most cowardly and reckless of crimes.<br><br>&quot;They had no thought for the very many people in the postal service and administrative offices who may have been injured or maimed by handling these packages.<br><br>&quot;Muirhead and McKenzie&#39;s deplorable actions were motivated by hatred and today&#39;s prosecution sends out a strong message that this has no place in a modern Scottish society. Their actions certainly have nothing to do with football and everything to do with mindless hate.&quot;<br><br>The case against McKenzie and Muirhead centred on five suspicious packages, two of them addressed to Lennon, which were discovered in spring 2011.<br><br>Police initially said the pieces of mail had been designed to kill or maim their intended targets, which also included the republican organisation Cairde Na hEireann.<br><br>But in reality Muirhead and McKenzie had constructed devices that could not explode, with the latter getting &quot;bomb making&quot; tips from 80s US television show The A-Team.<br><br>Gaffes<br><br>The duo committed a string of gaffes that lead to their conviction.

On one charge of sending a first hoax device to Lennon the jury returned a verdict of &quot;not proven&quot; in the case of Muirhead.<br><br>The judge said both men had been &quot;convicted of unusual but serious offences&quot;. He said sentencing would be deferred until 27 April for social inquiry reports.<br><br>Members of the men&#39;s families were in tears as the jury came back into court to deliver their verdict after deliberating for two and a half hours. One woman shouted as Muirhead was led down to the holding cells: &quot;Keep your head up. You will walk out of here. You will.&quot; He nodded and raised his hand at the public seats.<br><br>There were angry scenes outside the court as other family members shouted abuse at camera crews and photographers before being pushed away by police.<br><br>The five-week trial heard that both men were committed supporters of Glasgow&#39;s Rangers FC, Celtic&#39;s traditionally Protestant arch rival, while Muirhead was an active supporter and admirer of Protestant loyalist organisations, including the Ulster Volunteer Force terrorist group.<br><br>The men were arrested in May 2011 following a major anti-terrorist investigation involving the security services and undercover surveillance teams launched after potentially explosive devices were sent to Lennon, McBride and Godman in March.<br><br>The police also believe the pair were planning further attacks: they found further similar materials after dawn raids on both men&#39;s houses.<br><br>In the closing stages of the trial, the prosecution was ordered to drop charges of plotting to murder the victims after the judge, Lord Turnbull, ruled there was insufficient evidence. The pair instead faced reduced charges of plotting to assault their targets, and a second charge of making Lennon believe the first hoax device they sent was capable of exploding and injuring him.<br><br>Strathclyde police were originally told by forensics experts that the devices were very dangerous as they contained a volatile homemade explosive called TATP (tri-acetone tri-peroxide) or organic peroxide, often associated with al-Qaida attacks.<br><br>When the plot was revealed last April, police commanders warned that they were &quot;viable devices&quot; and &quot;very definitely capable of causing real harm&quot;.<br><br>But the jury learned that more detailed forensic checks found that none of the devices were viable. Their electronic devices, such as cheap digital watches and wires, were not capable of acting as detonators. The first parcel sent to McBride was an inert hoax device, using putty and 248 nails.<br><br>Prosecution witnesses told the high court, however, that the presence of TATP and organic peroxide in three of the devices sent to Lennon, Godman &ndash; who had just retired as an MSP after serving as deputy presiding officer of the Scottish parliament &ndash; and the republican group Cairde na h&Eacute;ireann still meant they were potentially dangerous.<br><br>The TATP and organic peroxide was theoretically capable of exploding with a battery charge or shock.<br><br>The incendiary device sent to McBride, an outspoken lawyer who was Lennon and Celtic&#39;s QC who died suddenly midway through the trial while abroad, included a small container of petrol and was packed with nails.<br><br>Tim Niven-Smith, for the prosecution, told the jury that both Muirhead and McKenzie believed their devices were bombs and were capable of causing injuries.<br><br>The jury saw CCTV images of McKenzie buying plastic travel bottles, padded envelopes and a watch from a local discount shop, and then nails from a nearby B&amp;Q on 14 April, the day before the package for McBride was found in a postbox.<br><br>A bug in McKenzie&#39;s car later recorded the men discussing how one had taught &quot;thingwy [sic] how to make a bomb&quot;, and talking of placing one outside a police station and &quot;letting the ****** off&quot;. Muirhead sent McKenzie a text message which read &quot;Sorry m8 our package was in Pennyburn last night waiting on navy bomb disposbal [sic].&quot;<br><br>Muirhead&#39;s son Gordon, who lived near a postbox used to post the McBride device, said both his father and McKenzie had warned him not to turn left, in the direction of the postbox, the night it was sent. McKenzie had also told Gordon Muirhead: &quot;If you hear a bang in the night don&#39;t open the curtains&quot;.<br><br>In a police interview, Muirhead admitted watching the first device to Lennon being posted in March 2011, and to obtaining the peroxide hair dye for the devices, but wholly blamed McKenzie. He claimed McKenzie had &quot;pure hatred&quot; for Lennon and Celtic, and that he was terrified of his friend.<br><br>In his police interviews, McKenzie admitted to building the devices. He told police &quot;OK, then aye, I&#39;m involved.&quot; He claimed the first was intended just to be a hoax, but said the latter devices were intended to &quot;scare&quot; their recipients. He had seen on the internet that using peroxide would make them &quot;flash&quot;.<br><br>The first of the devices was sent to Lennon on 3 March, the day after the Celtic manager had a violent touchline confrontation with the then Rangers assistant coach Ally McCoist following an ill-tempered cup match at Celtic Park which saw three players sent off and 34 fans arrested on the stands.<br><br>The discovery of the first hoax device was originally kept secret by Strathclyde police. As more devices emerged, they asked for a media blackout to avoid jeopardising their undercover operation.<br><br>Lennon, a hate figure for Rangers fans and Ulster loyalists, had previously received bullets in the post and death threats.<br><br>Over the next six weeks four potentially dangerous devices were sent, including a second addressed to Lennon, using the peroxide-based explosive TATP. Bomb disposal squads were called out to deal with the devices at sorting offices and police stations in Ayrshire, Glasgow and Belfast, where the device addressed to Cairde na h&Eacute;ireann had been sent to a postal returns depot after it could not be delivered.<br><br>Both men had denied the charges. The police were unable to find any forensic evidence directly tying either man to the devices, relying heavily on witness testimony, the CCTV evidence and bugging.<br><br>Their defence lawyers insisted they had only sent out hoax devices intended to scare and frighten their targets, and knew they were unable to explode.<br><br>Donald Findlay QC, for McKenzie, said it might have been a &quot;sick joke&quot;, but that was all it was. &quot;They were sending a message to scare, cause alarm, cause panic or inconvenience. That is all that it was. It was not a conspiracy to cause severe injury.&quot;<br><br>Gordon Jackson QC, for Muirhead, said: &quot;No matter how horrid, nasty, even evil to do it, it&#39;s absolutely not the crime that is alleged.&quot;  <br><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <h3>The actual envelope addressed to Lennon</h3><img align="bottom" alt="Controversies (2011) - Pic" height="372" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/UY1KBxqKuOw-vT78-ESWNQ100508/GW459H372" title="Controversies (2011) - Pic" width="459"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Controversies (2011) - Pic" height="360" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/PoYKGf_8fcfIJ8AelJYG6Q107623/GW468H360" title="Controversies (2011) - Pic" width="468"><br><br><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>     Neil Lennon &lsquo;bomb&rsquo; plot trial: Pair handed five-year jail sentences</h3>The Scotsman<br><br>Published on Saturday 28 April 2012 03:29<br><br>THE actions of two men who sent parcel bombs to Celtic manager Neil Lennon and others connected to the football club were described as &ldquo;incomprehensible&rdquo; as they were jailed for five years each.<br><br>&bull; Pair targeted Neil Lennon, former MSP Trish Godman and the late QC Paul McBride<br><br>&bull; Previous charge of conspiring to murder their targets was thrown out<br><br>&bull; McKenzie to serve concurrent 18-month term for hoax bomb<br><br>Trevor Muirhead, 44, and Neil McKenzie, 42, were jailed for conspiring to assault Lennon, former MSP Trish Godman and the late QC Paul McBride, as well as people at the republican organisation Cairde Na hEireann, by sending devices they believed were capable of exploding and causing severe injury.<br><br>McKenzie, from Saltcoats, Ayrshire, was also sentenced to 18 months for a separate charge of posting a hoax bomb to Lennon at Celtic Park to make him believe it was likely to explode. That will run concurrently with his five-year sentence. Muirhead, from Kilwinning, Ayrshire, was cleared of the charge by a not-proven verdict.<br><br>Both men were originally accused of a more serious charge of conspiring to murder their targets but it was thrown out a day before the trial concluded due to insufficient evidence.<br><br>At the High Court in Glasgow yesterday, judge Lord Turnbull said he could not &ldquo;fathom&rdquo; what was in their minds when they decided to send the packages.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;It is incomprehensible that two such family men, in their 40s, would engage in such reckless and serious criminal conduct.<br><br>&ldquo;Even the sending of a package as a bomb hoax would always be a serious offence and would be bound to result in a custodial sentence &ndash; that is because of the widespread disruption and anxiety caused by such conduct.&rdquo; The judge said it was &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; he was not dealing with what would be considered &ldquo;acts of terrorism&rdquo;.<br><br>A-Team &lsquo;taught&rsquo; McKenzie how to make hoax bomb<br><br>The jury heard that McKenzie told police he learned how to make a hoax bomb after seeing the 1980s TV show, the A-Team.<br><br>Giving evidence at the trial, Lennon said he was left &ldquo;very disturbed&rdquo; after finding out he had been targeted. He said he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t believe the lengths some people will go to&rdquo;.<br><br>The plot centred on four suspicious packages, all of them non-viable, discovered last spring.<br><br>A device sent to Lennon at Celtic&rsquo;s training ground in Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, was intercepted at a sorting office in Kirkintilloch on 26 March last year when a postman saw a nail protruding from it. It tested positive for peroxide, which can be used to make explosives.<br><br>Two days later, a package delivered to Ms Godman&rsquo;s constituency office in Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, caused the evacuation of the building. Liquid inside a plastic bottle within tested positive for a small amount of the primary explosive triacetone triperoxide.<br><br>Also on 28 March, a postman tried to deliver a package to Cairde Na hEireann in Glasgow&rsquo;s Gallowgate. After two failed attempts, it was sent to the Royal Mail&rsquo;s national returns centre in Belfast, where it was found to contain potentially explosive peroxide.<br><br>No risk of injury from packages<br><br>The final package, found on 15 April in a postbox on Montgomerie Terrace, Kilwinning, was addressed to Mr McBride. The lawyer, who died before he was due to give evidence at the trial, was known to have represented Lennon and Celtic.<br><br>Lord Turnbull said yesterday: &ldquo;There was quite simply no relevant sense that it could be said that any explosive material was present. There was also no form of detonator or method of causing ignition.<br><br>&ldquo;There was no risk of injury to anyone beyond the risk of some accidental contact with nails present in the various packages &ndash; and these aspects are taken into account in deciding the appropriate sentence.&rdquo;  <br><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <br><br></div>
