I present to you the 2008-2009 Kerrydale Street Player of the Year with a look back at each player during Strachan&#39;s reign and his last season in charge.<br><br>First the players that failed to even get a vote this year.......<br><br><a href="/page/McGowan%2C+Paul" target="_self">McGowan</a>, <a href="/page/McCourt%2C+Patrick" target="_self">McCourt</a>, <a href="/page/Killen%2C+Chris" target="_self">Killen</a>, <a href="/page/Hutchinson%2C+Ben" target="_self">Hutchison</a>, <a href="/page/Flood%2C+Willo" target="_self">Flood</a>, <a href="/page/Donati%2C+Massimo" target="_self">Donati</a>, <a href="/page/Conroy%2C+Ryan" target="_self">Conroy</a>, <a href="/page/Caddis%2C+Paul" target="_self">Caddis</a> and <a href="/page/Brown%2C+Mark" target="_self">Brown (Mark)</a>.  <br><br>Twenty players in total received votes.<br><br>Signed in January 2006 from Dundee Utd for 500,000 <a href="/page/Wilson%2C+Mark" target="_self">Mark Wilson</a> props the votes up with a whopping one.<br><br>Following close behind with two points is our Japanese prodigy <a href="/page/Mizuno%2C+Koki" target="_self">Koki Mizono</a> who made his impact in the first team with a man of the match award against Falkirk.<br><br>Another youngster getting votes is the Irishman <a href="/page/Sheridan%2C+Cillian" target="_self">Cillian Sheridan</a> who joined the club in the summer of 2006, he had a good run in the team this year and finished with nine votes.<br><br>It was a disappointing season for the big Dutchman with the big name <a href="/page/Vennegoor+of+Hesselink%2C+Jan" target="_self">Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink</a> finishing with only six goals and showing a general sense of carthorseness. One of Strachan&#39;s biggest signings he arrived from PSV for 3.4 million and started his Celtic career very brightly before fading away with last years poor season. His twenty seven votes reflects his performance last year.<br><br><a href="/page/Robson%2C+Barry" target="_self">Barry Robson</a> arrived in the winter transfer window in January 2008 and played a huge part in the Bhoys retaining the title with some sterling performances in the run in. His impact was lessened last season with a combination of injuries and selection slowing him down, he squeezes in ahead of big Jan with twenty nine votes.<br><br>It was rumoured from the week he left for Aston Villa that <a href="/page/Maloney%2C+Shaun" target="_self">Shaun Maloney</a> would return to Celtic and he finally did last summer. He showed flashes of the form that earned him player of the year plaudits in 2006 but injuries lead to a loss of form and limited first team appearances. In a sign of how low he was rated with thirty seven points, look who is next......<br><br>Much maligned and filling the legendary left back spot at Celtic <a href="/page/Naylor%2C+Lee" target="_self">Lee Naylor</a> seemed to play there last season for the sole reason there was no one else. He arrived from Wolves for 600,000 in the summer of 2006 and briefly showed he might be the answer at left back but his deficiencies soon became apparent. His presence merited forty points from the KDS voting public.<br><br>Its a huge jump in votes to the next in line who at times filled in for Naylor at left back and also at center half when required. When he has been promoted to the first team <a href="/page/O%27Dea%2C+Darren" target="_self">Darren O&#39;Dea</a> has never put a foot wrong but has never been deemed worthy of a regular spot. His highlight header in the CIS Cup Final brought us the seasons only silverware and more than one hundred more votes than Naylor with one hundred and forty five.<br><br>The Celtic captain narrowly misses out on the top ten. One of the players that really owes his place in the team to Gordon Strachan, who threw big Mick into the action after his terrible start, <a href="/page/McManus%2C+Stephen" target="_self">McManus</a> never looked back eventually taking the captaincy from Neil Lennon. As last season went on Mick&#39;s injuries took their toll, he played through them for months but no doubt they contributed to his two hundred and nine votes and twelfth place.<br><br>Just missing out on the top ten is a man Strachan brought to the club at the end of the 2007 winter transfer window. Some love him, some hate him, almost all hated him before he joined! In the previous season it was <a href="/page/Hartley%2C+Paul" target="_self">Paul Hartley</a> and Barry Robson that drove Celtic forward to a title but he never reached those heights last season. His two hundred and forty three votes are some way off making the top ten.<br><br>And so to the top ten where all but one of the players were signed by Strachan.<br><br><img align="left" alt="10th Glenn Loovens" height="240" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Z-5rT03auXKwdOeXEi1T4g13595/GW320H240" title="10th Glenn Loovens" width="320">One of our major signings last year, everyone was wondering why on earth the big Dutchman <a href="/page/Loovens%2C+Glenn" target="_self">Loovens</a> was brought to Celtic Park when he barely got off the bench for months. Once he got his chance in the team however he put in some very solid performances as the season went on. His four hundred and sixteen points came solely from the last few months of the season. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="9th Georgios Samaras" height="240" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/WnaxGs71v6QxFisFfDqSHA17837/GW320H240" title="9th Georgios Samaras" width="320">Only two points ahead on four hundred and eighteen is someone who has the opposite story to his season. Our other big summer signing <a href="/page/Samaras%2C+Georgios" target="_self">Samaras</a> started the season high on confidence and seemed able to demolish teams single handedly as any doubts over his signing were erased. An injury however slowed him down and led to a dramatic drop in confidence and goals as the season went on.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="8th Marc Crosas" height="319" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/U42nPOeMUsNw9jm-BivPPw16096/GW283H319" title="8th Marc Crosas" width="283">In eighth place with more than double his closest competitor <a href="/page/Crosas%2C+Marc" target="_self">Marc Crosas</a> put in some performances that proved he deserved to be in the heart of our midfield but bizarre selections led to him being dropped at several points in the season. Maybe it was a cunning ploy by us to ensure Barcelona did not want to buy him back or just one of Strachan&#39;s many tactical choices but I am sure he would have more than nine hundred and seventy eight votes if he was selected more often.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="7th Artur Boruc" height="191" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/BiiagIhQ51HEZjEN_vGFKw12521/GW286H191" title="7th Artur Boruc" width="286">In seventh and cracking the thousand barrier with one thousand and seventy eight points is Strachan&#39;s best signing. Arriving from Legia Warsaw in July 2005 the holy goalie&#39;s first goal was to displace David Marshall, once he accomplished that he has cemented his place in our history as one of the best keepers we have ever had. It could even be said some of <a href="/page/Boruc%2C+Artur" target="_self">Boruc</a>&#39;s performances in the early years helped Strachan to the success he had. It had been a long time and for some Celtic fans a first to have a team with a dependable star between the posts and at times rumblings of one of the best in the world. Last season was not Artur&#39;s strongest with some high profile blunders but the majority of the Celtic support are behind him. The fact the huns detest him can never hinder his popularity either.....<br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="6th Aiden McGeady" height="319" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/q2NgHvl_eWZKnG_g3lm10A12960/GW209H319" title="6th Aiden McGeady" width="209">Last years player of the year narrowly misses out on the top five. The only player in the top ten not signed by Gordon Strachan our most precocious home grown talent in recent memory did not have his best season but still showed moments of skill most can only dream of. It can be argued that <a href="/page/McGeady%2C+Aiden" target="_self">McGeady</a> benefited from Strachan&#39;s guidance during his time at the club although with Strachan&#39;s standing at an all time low with the Celtic support many will say he curtailed Aiden&#39;s natural talents. Time and our new manager will tell, as well as the all important KDS vote next year when we hope to see him higher than sixth and with more points than sixteen hundred and forty four.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="5th Shunsuke Nakamura" height="316" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/G3ORzr0c_8J09sJRuEDJ3g46883/GW247H316" title="5th Shunsuke Nakamura" width="247">In judging Strachan&#39;s signings its a two horse race between Boruc and the first player in the top five <a href="/page/Nakamura%2C+Shunsuke" target="_self">Nakamura</a> with seventeen hundred and seventy four votes.. Boruc may have been more consistent but Naka delivered moments in his time at Celtic Park that will live in the memories for many a year. The Man U free kick, all the goals against Kille and that goal against the huns. For me I loved Nakas time in Paradise but always thought what if he had been allowed to play centrally and let loose a little. We will never know. His last season with us was inconsistent, great games followed by invisible ones and perhaps the time was right to move on.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="th Scott McDonald" height="216" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Hb5CEffYx6pQWqlrZXLYvA16365/GW288H216" title="th Scott McDonald" width="288">A 700,000 move from Motherwell in the summer of 2007 had much gnashing of teeth and wailing on KDS regarding <a href="/page/McDonald%2C+Scott" target="_self">Scott McDonald</a> but he has proved his place in the side. Last season would have been tough for any forward with our team creating few chances in many games and playing restrictive football that would have made Walter proud. The wee Aussie kept plugging away though and at times seemed to be one of the few showing any passion on the field. His highlight goals on the big stage against Man U and Rangers showed he loves the big games but it does not get any bigger than finishing with one thousand nine hundred and eighteen votes in the KDS POTY. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>And so to the top three. At the beginning of the year few if any would have listed two of these players but they are there on merit having a fine season.<br><br><img align="left" alt="3rd - Andreas Hinkel" height="327" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Chwz9sNpwUVPTsjmt-cxJA45674/GW275H327" title="3rd - Andreas Hinkel" width="275">In 3rd we have <a href="/page/Hinkel%2C+Andreas" target="_self">Andreas Hinkel</a> who joined us from Seville for 1.9m in the January transfer window in 2008. He built upon his first six months at the club with a very solid second season. He is not the flashiest player on our team but what he does at right back he does very well. With a new manager in place it will be interesting to see in a few years time how highly regarded Hinkel will be in terms of the players Strachan signed. His third place on two thousand and eighty four points was some way behind the second place however.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Not many would have had Caldwell down as our second best player of the year at the start of the season. Who would have imagined him ahead of previous players of the year like McGeady and Nakamura or over heroes like Boruc. Yet KDS has spoken and here the heid is. It was not only in the SPL that Gary performed, he shone on the big stage as well, a place where his errors and weaknesses have been exposed in the past. Our KDS European Player of the Year was none other than Gary. Some may say that award gave him the confidence to put in the showings he did in the latter part of the season where he was consistently leading the team on the pitch and in the KDS voting. Another who owes a lot to Strachan he was under fire before he even arrived with few thinking he had what was required to be at Celtic let alone have calls for him to be captain as happened last year. His two thousand four hundred and ninety eight votes show a player that has developed at Celtic and will no doubt be remembered as one of Strachan&#39;s success stories.<br><img align="bottom" alt="2nd Place" height="256" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/1ZSW6OasQXpBR4u2ThD-Lg12396/GW200H256" title="2nd Place" width="200"><img align="bottom" alt="Gary Caldwell" height="155" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/jTu3mrmrxVw_ltJgg8UyXg10918/GW258H155" title="Gary Caldwell" width="258"><br><br><br><br><img align="left" alt="1st place Scott Brown" height="159" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/dDSvmre71XCZuMSn2q-Frw11078/GW253H159" title="1st place Scott Brown" width="253">And so to our clear and deserved winner. Scott Brown arrived at Celtic Park at the start of the 2007-2008 season amid much fanfare with Celtic moving to sign him ahead of Tottenham, Everton and some part time club from the other side of Glasgow. His first season however was listed as disappointing by most. A combination of personal problems, the move to a larger club and a change in playing system led to a season where flashes of his Hibs&#39; form and his potential would be offset by games in which he struggled and ran the line with the referee. Last season however was a different story with Scott reigning in his temper and finding a consistency that was lacking a year earlier. At times during the season it seemed Scott alone was driving the team forward. Despite being Strachan&#39;s biggest money signing it seemed he was shackled by the system in place at Celtic Park and was thriving in spite of it. A polar opposite to other players mentioned earlier who owe their rise in stature to Strachan, Scott Brown dragged up his level of performance and standing with the Celtic support despite his manager&#39;s refusal to change his tactics to suit his players. On top of the consistency we craved from Scott he added goals and a maturity to his game that looked like they would never come a year earlier. Many will say his level dipped towards the end of the season but in fairness the whole teams level of play dipped at the end leading to unspeakable events that we wont discuss here. There is no doubt however that over the season Scott Brown, with two thousand seven hundred and thirty one points, is the fitting winner of the 2008-2009 season Kerrydale Street Player of the Year. Well done Scott!<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Scott Brown KDS Player of the Year 2008/09" height="300" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/QTZrr0X4Z9fffeLQFM7pFg26282/GW300H300" title="Scott Brown KDS Player of the Year 2008/09" width="300"><img align="bottom" alt="Scott Brown" height="256" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/dsXY7tR9Ql35IWlCx9YlLA17382/GW319H256" title="Scott Brown" width="319"></div></td><td width="14"><br></td><td width="260"><div class="WPC-edit-area"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%"><font size="2"><br><a href="/page/KDS+Player+Of+The+Year" target="_self">MOTM Homepage</a><br><br><a href="/page/The+Rules" target="_self">Rules</a><br><br><a href="/page/KDS+POTY+Hall+of+Fame" target="_self">Hall of Fame</a><br><br><a href="/page/Latest+KDS+MOTM+Winner" target="_self">Latest MOTM Winner</a><br><br><a href="/page/KDS+Player+of+the+Year+2008%2F09" target="_self">Player of the Year</a><br><br>Seasons<br><a href="/page/Season+2006%2F07" target="_self">2006/07</a> - <a href="/page/Season+2007%2F08" target="_self">2007/08</a> - <a href="/page/Season+2008%2F09" target="_self">2008/09</a> - <a href="/page/Season+2009%2F10" target="_self">2009/10</a><br><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%"><div align="center">POTY Countdown</div><br><div align="center"><embed flashvars="transition=PixelDissolve&site=http://www.kerrydalestreet.com&imageServer=http://image.wikifoundry.com&albumId=124763" height="236" src="http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/kds/widget/unknown/78d1fd7229eda1fa65c0eb0ae02c0655e8e44029" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="236" wmode="transparent"></embed></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>
