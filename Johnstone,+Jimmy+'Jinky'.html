To fully understand why `<i>The Wee Man</i>` was given this  tremendous accolade we have to go back to his beginning.   <br><br>Jimmy  Johnstone had been kicking a ball for as long as he could remember, from a very  early age he spent hours upon hours playing in streets and public parks,  sometimes alone, sometimes with large groups of other youngsters and  occasionally with his older brother Pat `Blondie` Johnstone. Pat was a  fine player himself and Celtic were rumoured to be watching him closely,  unfortunately Pat was injured playing for his local boys guild team and  the resultant cartilage problem effectively ended his career. Years  later Jimmy would say that he can remember the disappointment on his  father&#39;s face (Matt Johnstone) when Pat suffered this injury and maybe,  subconsciously, this drove Jimmy Johnstone on.<br><br>Jimmy Johnstone was first discovered  at the ripe old age of 8 years old by a teacher, John Crines. Crines  eventually persuaded the shy Jimmy Johnstone to join the school team St Columba.  With Jimmy Johnstone in the team St Columba&#39;s became almost unstoppable and won  every competition they entered. Upon moving to high school, St John&#39;s,  Jimmy Johnstone also helped their school team to previously unseen heights.<br><br>During  a St John&#39;s trip to Manchester to play in a tournament Jimmy Johnstone was made  aware of his first footballing hero, Sir Stanley Matthews. Jimmy Johnstone was  mesmerised by Matthews&#39; ability with a ball and upon returning home  quickly obtained a copy of his autobiography. Jimmy Johnstone would spend hours  copying the techniques Mathews had used in his early years to perfect  his ball skills. Basically this involved laying out dozens of milk  bottles and dribbling the ball round them over and over again.<br><br>It  helped because during the next St John&#39;s trip to Manchester, he was  spotted by a Manchester United scout by the name of Wishbone.  Fortunately for Celtic fate decreed and the chaplain of St John&#39;s, a  Frank Cairney, who was a keen Celtic supporter, threw United off the  track by informing them that Jimmy Johnstone was keen to join Celtic. Cairney  immediately contacted a Celtic scout he knew, John Higgins, of United&#39;s  interest and Jimmy Johnstone was invited to train with Celtic two nights a week.<br><br>Jimmy  Johnstone trained with Celtic twice a week for a year and on the 7th October 1961  he made his debut for the reserves against St Johnstone in a 4-2 win.  Jimmy scored one and made the other three. Watching the game was then  Celtic manager Jimmy McGrory who signed Jimmy Johnstone that very night.  Incidentally Tommy Gemmell also signed that night, a player he was to be  intrinsically linked with through the rest of his life, famously  on-field and mischievously off-field.<br><br>As was customary in those  days Jimmy Johnstone was farmed out to a junior club, Blantyre Celtic. This was  supposed to be for a year but such was his ability he was chosen to play  for Junior Scotland against Junior Northern Ireland. <br><br>Fate would  decree that legendary Celtic scout Jimmy Gribben was watching the game  and Jimmy Gribben immediately suggested to Jimmy McGrory that Jimmy Johnstone be recalled to  Celtic.<br><br>Jimmy Johnstone would have to wait two years for his first team  debut though, that came at Rugby Park Kilmarnock. Celtic lost 6-0 that  day and there are few Celtic fans who could have contemplated the  impression Jimmy Johnstone would make on their lives in the next 12 years. Jimmy  had to wait another month before his next game, away to Hearts in a 4-3  defeat although this brought the first of Jimmy Johnstone`s 130 Celtic goals.<br><br>He  retained his place for the next game, the Scottish Cup final against  Rangers, which ended in a 1-1 draw with Jimmy Johnstone earning rave reviews in  the press for his display. He was inexplicably dropped for the replay  which Celtic lost 3-0 and this brought out anger and frustration within  the ranks of the Celtic support at a fractious time in Celtic&#39;s history.  Although Jimmy McGrory was manager it was no secret that chairman  Robert Kelly picked the team and his selections were often eccentric to  say the least. Jimmy Johnstone was actually contemplating jacking it all in at  this point. Things were though to change miraculously.<br><br><h3>  The arrival of Stein and the Glory Years<img align="right" alt="Jimmy Johnstone Pics - Kerrydale Street" height="316" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/K80DrKRxeDcGAG6fBJahXQ78772/GW379H316" title="Jimmy Johnstone Pics - Kerrydale Street" width="379"></h3>Jimmy Johnstone`s  Celtic career would be very much stop start for a further two years,  until Jock Stein arrived and transformed the club and Jimmy Johnstone along with  it. Under Stein, Celtic became one of the most respected teams in Europe,  integral to this success was Jimmy Johnstone himself. Although it has  to be said that he was out of favour when Jock Stein arrived, so much so that  he was not named in the 1965 Scottish Cup Final victory at Hampden  which launched the beginning of the successful Stein era.   <br><br>By  the 1965/66 season Jimmy Johnstone was now an essential part of the Celtic team.  In October 1965 he won his first winners medal when Celtic beat Rangers  2-1 at Hampden in the League Cup Final. Jimmy Johnstone tormented the Rangers  defence and gained Celtic a penalty for the second goal when Rangers&#39;  defender Davie Provan brought him down. Sadly, after the game there was a  pitch invasion from the Rangers&#39; end of the ground during Celtic&#39;s lap  of honour and a few of the Celtic side had to fight their way from the  field.<br><br>Celtic won their first title for 12 years in May 1966 at  Fir Park by beating Motherwell 1-0 and Jimmy Johnstone had played a huge part in  the success of that season. The only tarnish in the season, was that a  controversial disallowed goal at Anfield against Liverpool prevented  Celtic from reaching the final of the European Cup Winners Cup.<br><br>By  1967 Jimmy Johnstone was one of the most recognisable players in European  football with his small frame, bright red hair and jinking, dribbling,  playing style. This was still an era when every team played with  orthodox wingers and Jimmy Johnstone was rated at as one of the best. He was  comfortable going past a defender on the outside and could also be  devastating cutting inside and contributing with many goals.<br><br>On  the way to the 1967 European Cup Final, Jimmy had turned in several great  performances, particularly in Nantes where the French had appreciated  his talents and christened him the &#39;<i>Flying Flea</i>&#39; in the French  press. In the semi against Dukla Prague he had scored the vital first  goal and had kept the Czech defenders on edge for the entire match.<br><br>On  6 May 1967 Jimmy Johnstone gave one of his greatest performances in a Celtic  jersey at Ibrox. He scored twice in a 2-2 match, a result which gave Celtic  their second successive league title. On a mudbath of a pitch in pouring  rain he ran at the Rangers defence and unleashed a glorious,  unstoppable shot into the top corner of the goal, and this with his  weaker left foot.<br><br>In the gloroius final in the European Cup in Lisbon, his dribbling technique destroyed the  defensive set up of Inter Milan. Tarcisso Burgnich, Jimmy Johnstone&#39;s man marker,  was led a dance for the entire match. Jimmy Johnstone was essential to Celtic&#39;s  victory and was given a roving commission by Stein in the final in  another play to confuse the Inter defenders. The entire continent  witnessed that night in Lisbon what a great player the wee man had  become.<br><br>Shortly after Lisbon Celtic were invited to play Real  Madrid in the great Alfredo Di Stefano&#39;s testimonial game. Celtic had a  lot to lose and as new European Champions they were putting their  reputation on the line. Jimmy rose to the occasion and gave (arguably)  his greatest ever performance for Celtic. He tormented the Spaniards to  the point that the Real fans began to chant &#39;ole&#39; each time the wee man  beat another defender. Celtic won 1-0 and were now Europe&#39;s greatest  side without any doubt. Upon the final whistle Jimmy Johnstone picked the ball up  and held it aloft with one hand. The stadium rose as one to acclaim the  performance of the `<i>wee man</i>` that night. It is often claimed by Jimmy Johnstone`s  team mates that Real Madrid tried to sign Jimmy Johnstone after that performance  although nothing was admitted officially by Real Madrid or Celtic.<br><br>In  1967, he was named third in the European footballer of the year award, a  notable achievement, behind Florian Albert and Bobby Charlton, however  it was felt that Jimmy Johnstone should have earned greater recognition given his  achievements that season.<br><br>In the late 1960&#39;s Jimmy Johnstone&#39;s game matured  and he became a more complete player. The Celtic right hand side trio  of Jim Craig, Bobby Murdoch and Jimmy was the envy of Europe and when  Jimmy Johnstone was on form it seemed Celtic were unstoppable. In December 1968 he  gave another unforgettable display when Celtic beat Dundee United 7-2  at Parkhead. Contemporaries and fans from that era still talk of that  performance to this day.<br><br>In 1969 Celtic beat Hibs 6-2 in the  League Cup Final and Jimmy Johnstone was again to the fore in another great Celtic  performance. Weeks later they beat Rangers 4-0 in the 1969 Scottish Cup  Final although Jimmy Johnstone was suspended for this one and one wonders at the  scoreline had the wee man played that day. Perhaps Rangers were let off  lightly.<br><br>Many Celtic fans feel the display he gave in the 5-1  victory over Red Star Belgrade at Parkhead in the European Cup was his  best ever. At half time Stein had cajoled him by saying he would not  have to travel to the return leg if Celtic gained a substantial lead  (Jimmy Johnstone had a phobia about flying!). In the second half Celtic smashed in  four goals all scored or created by Jimmy Johnstone. Despite pleas from all  around him he didn&#39;t travel to Yugoslavia for the return much to the  disappointment of the Red Star officials.<br><br><h3>  1970&#39;s<font size="2"><br></font><font size="2"><img align="right" alt="Jimmy Johnstone 1973" height="430" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Nqp1J4W7sh7eH3SzRF8gkg141256/GW226H430" title="Jimmy Johnstone 1973" width="226"></font></h3>By  1970 Celtic fans could boast that their man was the greatest player in  Britain, eclipsing even the likes of Best, Charlton, Bremner and Ball.  He proved it in the 1970 European Cup Semi final when he tore the much  vaunted Leeds United defence apart over two legs. He was on song at  Hampden in the second leg and tormented the great Leeds &amp; English  World Cup defenders, Charlton, Hunter and Cooper. This earned Celtic a  place in the 1970 European Cup Final but they went down 2-1 to Feyenoord  of Rotterdam. The Dutch side had a tight reign on Jimmy Johnstone that night and  he could not make an impression which was a terrible disappointment to  everyone at Celtic.   <br><br>At this time Rothmans selected a British  best eleven side from a panel of experts and Jimmy Johnstone was chosen in 1970,  1971 and 1972 which was a considerable achievement and showed that his  talents were fully appreciated south of the border.<br><br>Jimmy Johnstone was  always the man for the big occasion and could be relied upon in the heat  of Celtic v Rangers games. For a small man he became famous for his  headed goals against Rangers. Twice at Ibrox he score the winning goal  from headers. In 1971 with seconds remaining he out-jumped the Rangers  defence to loop in a header for a 3-2 win. In 1973 he stooped to head a  cross from Davie Hay past the lumbering figure of Peter McCloy. Jimmy  Johnstone often kept his best performances for Rangers games despite the heavy  tackling and physical punishment often meted out to him.<br><br>The 1971  Scottish Cup Final replay is remembered as the &#39;Jimmy Johnstone final&#39;.  Stein gave him another roving role, and with his close control and  ability to beat a man he was instrumental in Celtic&#39;s 2-1 victory in a  game where the scoreline did not remotely represent Celtic&#39;s  superiority. One year later, in the 1972 Scottish Cup Final. he was on  song yet again when Celtic beat Hibs by a record 6-1 scoreline. At this  time when Jimmy Johnstone was on form the feeling was he was unstoppable. However  he could not breach the Inter Milan defence in the 1972 European Cup  semi final and Celtic lost on penalties.<br><br>There was the occasional  disappointment and he was carried off injured in the 1971 League Cup  Final against Partick Thistle early in the match after a bad tackle by  future Celtic team mate Ronnie Glavin. Celtic went down 4-1 and it is  thought had Jimmy Johnstone remained fit on the field then it may have been a  different result.<br><br>As the 1970&#39;s wore on Jimmy Johnstone was still a regular  in Stein&#39;s team but could be left out on occasions mostly through ill  discipline. He roared back to form in the spring of 1973 when Celtic and  Rangers were tied in a race for the league. Celtic triumphed on 28  April after a 3-0 win at Easter Road and the wee man was in great form  that day. He had calmed the team from the start by keeping possession  and creating space for other players around him helping to make it 8  League title in a row.<br><br>He was often a victim of brutality from  defenders, none more so than against the &#39;animals&#39; of Atletico Madrid in  the 1974 European Cup semi final at Parkhead. Vicious tackles rained  down on him that night and he was pictured next day covered in cuts and  bruises all inflicted by the Spanish team&#39;s defenders. Celtic received  no protection from UEFA&#39;s officials after three Atletico players had  been ordered off and despite receiving death threats Jimmy played in  Madrid as Celtic went down 2-0, bravely given the circumstances. They  were deprived of a crack at the mighty Bayern Munich and the likes of  Jimmy, Kenny Dalglish and Dixie Deans would have loved to pit their wits  against the great Franz Beckenbauer.<br><br>His last great Celtic  performance came in 1974 when Celtic beat Hibs 6-3 in the League Cup  Final. He scored the opening goal and created several others as Dixie  Deans helped himself to a another Hampden hat trick against Hibs.  Celtic&#39;s 10 in a row bid floundered at Ibrox in January 1975 on a day  when Jimmy Johnstone was named as sub, leading to rumours that he had enjoyed the  excesses of the new year and had been punished by being dropped. Had he  played the outcome could have been different.<br><br><h3>His final days at Celtic</h3>Jimmy Johnstone`s  Celtic career was over on 10th June 1975. The end was difficult. Rather  than an amicable denouement for Jinky, Jock was at the end of his  tether and things had come to a head. The chairman Desmond White told  the shattered player he was being given a free transfer. Years later  Jimmy Johnstone admitted it was like being handed down a death sentence, and he  left in tears &amp; tatters from that meeting. He bled Green &amp; White  but now it was all over. Jock Stein was exhausted and there was little  more he could do.   <br><br>He was devastated.<br><br>Jock Stein and  Jimmy Johnstone had a relationship that could only be described as  Father and Son, despite admittedly being terrified of Jock Stein, Jimmy Johnstone took  liberties with the big man that others dared not to. Perhaps most famous  of all was the time Jimmy Johnstone was substituted in a league game in October  1968 against Dundee Utd at Celtic Park. Jimmy Johnstone was replaced by George  Connelly and upon leaving the field Jimmy threw his shirt at Stein in  disgust. It hit the big man in the face and Jimmy Johnstone had to escape up the  tunnel with Stein in hot pursuit of him. Despite that, Stein loved him  dearly despite any of his faults and Jock&#39;s motivation of Jimmy Johnstone drove him  to a higher level than he could ever dream of.<br><br><h3>Jinky &amp; the Celtic support</h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="500"><tbody><tr><td class="                                                                                                                                                              WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%">&quot;It was his capacity to express effervescent, outrageous almost surreal   mischief through his play - and to make all of his darting runs and   surges of convoluted trickery a deadly weapon for his team - that   rendered him unforgettable. That and the ability not only to thrill but,   with his antics on the field, to evoke smiles and sometimes laughter.&quot;<br><b>Esteemed journalist Hugh McIlvaney on Jimmy Johnstone</b></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><img align="right" alt="Johnstone, Jimmy - Pic" height="246" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/GEICsDdDmIVqthG5RZNOGg703008/GW346H246" title="Johnstone, Jimmy - Pic" width="346"></h3>Jimmy  Johnstone was given a joint testimonial with Bobby Lennox when Celtic beat  Manchester United 4-0 in May 1976. At the end of the game the wee man  went on a final solo lap of honour in front 48,000 adoring fans. He  stopped at the Jungle and threw his boots into the crowd which was a  perfectly fitting act as the fans in the Jungle had often witnessed his  greatest performances on the wing. It was an emotional night and Jimmy Johnstone was in tears and was joined by many Celtic fans who recalled his  brilliance in a Celtic jersey. This was his last game for Celtic.<br><br>Many  Celtic players have enjoyed a wonderful rapport with the fans but it&#39;s  doubtful if there was any player more revered by the Celtic supporters  than Jinky. Even after he finished playing his popularity with the  supporters never waned and the feeling was reciprocated as he was always  to be seen around Celtic Park on match days. <br><br>There are numerous  further stories that can be told about Wee Jinky. Great film actor  Robert Duvall (famous for &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo; movies) got to know Jinky  after working on a film in Glasgow and ranked Jinky as the greatest  character he had ever met and he&rsquo;d met so many. It was quite an  accolade. Through Jinky&#39;s life, drink, women, laughter and pubbing were  behind most of the mischief, and alongside close friend Tommy Gemmell  they pushed things to the limit. He also loved to regale the public  also, and had a smashing singing voice, even recorded a song titled  &ldquo;Passing Time&rdquo; on the &ldquo;B-side&rdquo; to a club single. <br><br>One of the more  infamous incidents was whilst on duty for the national side. After a  late night&rsquo;s drinking after training, a few of the boys were walking  along the beach and saw a boat. They put Jinky into the boat and it set  off. However there were no oars! The boys hurriedly got in another boat  to get him but the boat had a leak in it! Jinky was lost and they had to  get the guards out to get him. As this was before a big game v England  the players were pilloried. However, we still won with a great  performance by Jinky who after the match cheekily stuck two fingers up  to the press gallery. A wee scamp!<br><br>Jinky was a lovable rogue and  could exasperate even the most patient of men, but Jock was like a  father and mentored and managed Jinky to the best of his ability. When  you have a talent like Jinky on your hands, you can hardly turn them  away, and Jock knew that better than any. Every manager has a great  talent who doesn&#39;t follow the norm. Willie Maley had Tommy McInally,  Jimmy McGrory had Charlie Tully, Jock had Jinky, O&rsquo;Neill had Hartson and  Strachan had Boruc. You always have a special case. <br><br><h3>  </h3><h3>  </h3><h3>Scotland</h3><h3>  <font size="2"><img align="right" alt="Jimmy Johnstone Scotland 1971" height="357" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/NbXTtK4nggGq_E-w6tHa3A59429/GW296H357" title="Jimmy Johnstone Scotland 1971" width="296"></font></h3>Jimmy  Johnstone had a mixed bag of memories at international level. In 1966 he had  scored twice against England in a 4-3 defeat and despite playing well he  was often inexplicably left out through the years. He amassed a paltry  23 caps through his career for Scotland.<br><br>Esteemed journalist Hugh McIlvanney put it as one of those mysteries best filed away but that would be shirking the truth.<br><br>He  used to receive terrible verbal abuse from the Rangers end at Hampden  on many occasions as the patrons in that era preferred the talents of  Henderson. Jimmy Johnstone always believed his greatest Scotland display was at  Pittodrie when he ripped the Belgium defence to shreds and had the  Aberdonian crowd in raptures that night in a 1-0 win.<br><br>In  fairness, he was up against stiff competition for the number 7  jersey  from the likes of Willie Henderson, Charlie Cooke, Willie Morgan,   Peter Lorimer and Jimmy Smith but it is felt that he should still have  gained  more caps. He was the best of the lot.<br><br>Pathetically, in  1974 having destroyed the England defence at Hampden as Scotland won  2-0, he earned a place in the 22 man squad for the 1974 World Cup but  then he was not chosen to play in any of Scotland&#39;s three matches.<br><br>He  was so down-heartened with his treatment by the management and the  Scotland support that actually he was said to have asked to be  left out of matches. It&#39;s a sad indictment on the Scottish football  support that they could have treated such a talent in the manner they  did.<br><br><h3>  </h3>  <h3>  Post-Celtic</h3>  <h3>  <img align="right" alt="Jinky" height="451" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/wiki/Jinky/image/1APf7+UUXXzGgstuC1hgbSQ==116597/GW300H451" title="Jinky" width="300"></h3>  <div align="center">  </div>After leaving Celtic in <a href="/page/1975" target="_self">1975</a>,  Jimmy Johnstone had spells with San Jose Earthquakes, Sheffield United,  Dundee, Shelbourne and Elgin City but his first love was Celtic and he  maintained close relations with the club for the rest of his life.   <br><br>Jimmy Johnstone would admit that during his spell with the above clubs his heart still lay with Celtic. <br><br>There  are still a few interesting stories to be told though including one  game for the San Jose earthquakes against New York Cosmos. Lining up for  New York was none other than Pele who reportedly ran the length of the  field to shake hands with Jimmy Johnstone and give him a pat on the  back. This delighted Jimmy and he turned in his best show for the  Earthquakes.<br><br>Jimmy Johnstone also hooked up with his Lisbon Lion team-mate  Tommy Gemmell when Jimmy Johnstone signed for Dundee. Gemmell was manager at the  time and saw Jimmy Johnstone as the perfect spur to take Dundee up a few notches.  It also allowed the two loveable rogues to reunite again for everyone&#39;s  entertainment &amp; frustration.<br><br>Unfortunately for all concerned  Jimmy Johnstone still pined for Celtic and was not a success at Dundee. Although  he did briefly play in the same team as a young Gordon Strachan, which  the young man said humorously many years later that he was still  recovering from after going out drinking with him. Strachan also said  that even though he was a Hibbee through and through, that Jinky was his  hero and as a kid who he wanted to be!<br><br>Jimmy Johnstone played his last  ever game on the 18th August 1979 for Elgin City against Deveronvale  before a crowd of 545. Jimmy Johnstone was released shortly afterwards.<br><br>Jimmy  Johnstone did return to Celtic for a 2 year spell in the mid 80`s coaching the  under 16`s and under 18`s and assisting reserve team manager Bobby  Lennox.<br><br>This unfortunately coincided with a troublesome time in Jimmy Johnstone`s life with alcohol problems being chief amongst them.<br><br>Drink  drove him to the bottom and his family sadly took the brunt of his  despair. Friend Willie Haughey helped him and turned his life around  after Jinky arrived at his office to try to sell to him his medals for  some drink. Thankfully, Jinky reformed and began getting fit again. We  can respect him for that and he became a perfect father. <br><br>Sunday  September 8th 2002 was the day Jimmy Johnstone was voted into the  greatest ever Celtic team and voted as the greatest ever Celtic player. A few  weeks later Jimmy was voted into the SFA hall of fame.<br><br>He  accepted both these awards with remarkable humility given he was  battling Motor Neurone disease at the time. In the case of Celtic`s  greatest ever player he admitted to being surprised Henrik Larsson  hadn`t won it.<br><br><h3>  Motor Neurone Disease and his passing away</h3>Jimmy Johnstone  was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease in 2002. <br><br>Despite a brave  battle against the disease, Jimmy Johnstone died on 13th March 2006. <br><br>Many  tributes were left at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a>  by fans and thousands witnessed the funeral cort&egrave;ge passing through the  streets of the east end of Glasgow. Jimmy Johnstone&#39;s Funeral was held on St.  Patrick&#39;s Day 17th March 2006 at St John The Baptist in his home village  of Uddingston and Jimmy Johnstone was laid to rest at Bothwell Park Cemetery.   <br><br>The League Cup final played on Sunday 19th March 2006 between Celtic and  Dunfermline became known as the `Jimmy Johnstone final`. Cetic won 3-0  and all wore the number 7 on their shorts.<br><br>In December 2009 a  statue of Jimmy Johnstone was unveiled outside the main entrance to Celtic Park.  On March 5th 2011, a Statue of Jock Stein was also unveiled outside  Celtic Park only a very short distance from Jimmy Johnstone`s. Many  supporters feel it appropriate that our greatest ever manager will now  watch over our greatest ever player at the gates of Paradise for all  eternity.<br><br>A fund bearing Jinky&#39;s name continues to raise money for research into the disease.

nickname as in &quot;Ten Thirty&quot; rhyming slang for Bertie.<br><br></div></div>
