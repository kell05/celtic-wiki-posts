However, the SPL and the SFA had also acquiesced to the request for this kick-off time, despite warnings from Strathclyde police, given the fat sum of money that SKY put into the Scottish game for the rights to televise selected games. SKY had spent the previous two weeks hyping the game in advertisements, placing undue emphasis on the tribal aspect, the needle and the fact that the game would be a championship make or break game in a local derby in an atmosphere where bigotry and sectarianism was and might be rife. They clearly if not expecting trouble, thought that it might occur and were rubbing their hands at the potential match audience figures and sales revenue. It is therefore quite staggering to see the degree of hauteur shown by Davie Provan and Jim White in their analysis during and after the game. <br><br>Given all this it was to a degree unsurprising that events unfolded as they did.<br><br>Below are some of the views, the events and the articles that were expressed in the period after the game.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>    Action will follow night of shame;Minister wants answers</h3><font size="1">The Herald 04/05/1999<br>Iain Wilson and Lynne Robertson</font><br><br> THE appalling scale of violence surrounding the Old Firm game emerged last night amid Government warnings that Scottish football cannot afford a repeat of such horrors when Rangers and Celtic meet again on May 29. <br>Around 360 incidents were logged before, during, and after the match - including a midnight attack on the home of referee Hugh Dallas, who was also injured by a thrown coin during the game. His home in Carfin, near Motherwell, is now being watched by police. <br><br>Even before kick-off, a mounted policeman was dragged from his horse and a traffic officer was dislodged from his motor cycle. <br>Both escaped serious injury, but other officers were also hurt in a catalogue of violence that included stabbings and assaults stretching from Glasgow to Ayr. <br><br>More than 300 fans clashed in Duke Street, where mounted police and officers with riot shields were caught in a crossfire of bricks and bottles as they charged to drive a wedge between battling fans. Strathclyde Police continue to play down the incidents, but Home Affairs Minister Henry McLeish disclosed: &quot;I know police were relieved that no-one was murdered, although there was a serious knife incident.&quot; <br><br>There were 68 arrests near the ground and 45 in the city centre. No-one has been arrested for the serious stabbing in Shettleston Road. <br>The Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football Association have announced a &#39;&#39;full and thorough&quot; joint inquiry. Scottish Sports Minister Sam Galbraith said: &quot;I expect a rapid response.&quot; <br>It is made all the more pressing because the Old Firm meets again in 25 days in the Scottish Cup Final at Hampden Park. <br>Mr Dallas, whose three sendings off added to the powderkeg atmosphere, will again take control: SFA spokesman Andy Mitchell said that decision was not a matter for discussion. <br><br>The inquiry will examine the conduct of players during and after the match as well as stewarding and security arrangements. <br>There has been widespread condemnation of the mayhem, which included pitch invasions; a steward hit on the head; and Rangers players being pelted with missiles on leaving the pitch after &quot;a huddle&quot; imitating Celtic players&#39; pre-match preparations. <br><br>Duke Street was sealed as supporters attacked each other close to a pub occupied by celebrating Rangers fans. <br>Women and children were among innocents trapped on the battlefield, where faces as well as cars were smashed. <br>The inquiry is expected to review Sunday night kick-offs, which allows for hours of heavy drinking which can fuel violence. Police confirmed many of the 113 arrests were drink related. <br><br>Rangers vice-chairman Donald Findlay QC, joined those - including the Roman Catholic Church - demanding a rethink on 6.05pm starts. <br>Another issue will be policing. More officers than normal were on duty given that Rangers could, and did, seal the league championship at Celtic&#39;s ground for the first time. <br>But Mr McLeish confirmed 15 minutes passed before more police were deployed from other parts of the city to throw a cordon around the pitch. <br>Even then, four supporters invaded the park. They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life. In addition, Mr Dallas required four stitches to a head wound. <br><br>Four hours after the game, windows were broken at Mr Dallas&#39; home. Clearly upset by the anguish caused to his family, he described the lone assailant as a lunatic, but added it had not put him off refereeing: &quot;It has just made me all the stronger.&quot; <br><br>Mr McLeish said it was a &quot;bad, bad night for Scottish football and Scotland.&quot; <br>He welcomed Celtic&#39;s life bans as a clear message and of the arrests said: &quot;We need a tough line for the simple reason that, over the last few decades, Scotland has now claimed to have an enviable reputation for order at football grounds.&quot; <br>That regard was now under pressure, but he remained confident the cup final can be a showcase. <br>He called for calm reflection over the disgraceful events, blamed on a mindless few - a view shared by Celtic chief executive Allan MacDonald, and Rangers&#39; vice-chairman Donald Findlay, QC. <br>Mr Findlay condemned the violence and said that there were lessons to be learned. <br>He emphasised that the good name of Celtic fans should not be tarnished by the actions of the few, but added: &quot;No violence in any context is acceptable. As an individual and as a club, we condemn all violence.&quot; <br><br>Rangers would sit with Celtic, the police, and football authorities to discuss the situation calmly. He promised: &quot;Anything that needs to be done will be done.&quot; <br>However, he said that removing some of the unacceptable things in football would take time. Mr Findlay claimed abandoning the game would have been an &quot;an over reaction,&quot; and stopped short of criticising the jubilant Rangers team over their &quot;huddle&quot;. <br>He said: &quot;It would be wrong for everybody to start criticising an individual player for how he behaved and how he reacted. The Rangers players went to the Rangers support at the end of the game. I think it would be a tragedy in our game if we can&#39;t do that.&quot; <br><br>Celtic spokesman Peter McLean said incidents were subject of closed circuit TV scrutiny. The club &quot;very much regrets&quot; what took place. <br>Chief Superintendent Richard Gray, Match Commander for the Cup final, said stringent security precautions will be in place. An SFA spokesman said: &quot;It is a showpiece event and every effort will be made to ensure it stays that way.&quot;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>The Apologies</h3><font size="2">Issued by the Celtic on behalf of the players on 5/5/99</font><br><br><blockquote><u><i><b>Stephane Mahe:</b></i></u> <br>    &quot;I have met with Allan MacDonald, Celtic&#39;s Chief Executive, and he has made it clear in the strongest terms that the Club will not accept anything other than the highest standards of behaviour from its players. &quot;<br><br>I have been heavily fined and seriously censured by the club, which I fully accept and respect. &quot;<br><br>&quot;I would like to make a full apology to the Celtic supporters, my fellow players, the Celtic management, the match officials and the general public for my behaviour, which I fully acknowledge was unacceptable.
