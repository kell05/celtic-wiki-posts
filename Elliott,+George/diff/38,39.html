In an official statement, the Middlesbrough Chief Constable says that  	  shortly after 10 o&#39;clcok on Tuesday night George Elliott, the well known  	  footballer, telephoned to the police station. A friend, he said, had  	  noticed what he thought were rags on the side of the car he had just  	  placed in his garage near Lothian Road, Middlesbrough, but closer  	  examination had revealed the body of a child wedged in the back part of  	  the car. Police officials proceeding to the garage found the boy face  	  downwards, head towards the back of the car, the left foot between the  	  chassis and silencer on the offside. The body was badly mutilated. They  	  got in touch with the Stockton police, who reported that the boy was known  	  to be missing, and they had followed a trail of blood for some distance.  	  The accident appearaed to have occurred in Parliament Street, Stockton.  	  The inquest will be opened today.&quot; - Aberdeen Press and  	  Journal, Thursday, 20 August 1925.<br><br>&quot;The members of the  	  jury, before the start of the proceedings, motored over the route taken by  	  the car on the night of the tragedy. They then inspected the car in the  	  yard, adjoining the court. George Washington Elliott, the driver of the  	  car, was present, and was represented by Mr. C.B. Fenwick, of Newcastle.  	  The evidence of the father of the boy was taken when the inquest was  	  opened a week ago, when he said that people in the street had told him  	  that the driver switched off the lights and drove on after the accident.  	  James Crow, a bright-looking boy of 11, said that he and the boy  	  Serrecchia with another boy went into Parliament Street at about 9.20 p.m.  	  Serrecchia stayed on one side of the road and witness and the other boy  	  crossed over. Serrecchia then shouted across, &quot;No shegs - I&#39;ve found a  	  tanner.&quot; Witness ran back and Serrecchia showed him some silver in his  	  hand. Serrecchia started to walk across the road to the other boy, and  	  witness followed a few yards behind. A motor horn was sounded and witness  	  saw a motor-car coming from the direction of Thornaby. It was then five  	  yards away. Witness stepped back quickly, but the car knocked down  	  Serrecchia, the middle of the radiator striking him. He fell on to his  	  back and the car went over him. The car passed on and I bent down to see  	  where he was&quot; said Crowe, &quot;but all I could see were sparks. The front axle  	  missed him. He was then lying with his head in the direction the car was  	  going. He seemed to be turned right over and the back axle caught him,  	  dragging him along with his head downwards.&quot; Witness said that he shouted,  	  &quot;Stop! there is a boy under the car. The car was then five yards away and  	  he whistled through his fingers. At the request of the Coroner, the boy  	  gave a similar whistle, and a shrill laugh which, he said, was similar to  	  the one he made at the time of the accident. Continuing, Crowe said that  	  the occupants of the car were near enough to hear his whistle. They took  	  no notice, however, the car swerving to the right hand side of the road.  	  The car, which was then on its proper side, was going at a medium speed  	  when the accident occurred, but he thought it went faster after he  	  whistled. He added: &quot;The car had no lights on when I first saw it, but  	  when it passed me I saw the back light go on. I looked for the number  	  plate and could not see it. Just before reaching the corner of Bowesfield  	  Lane I saw the rear light go on.&quot; Serrecchia was being dragged along the  	  ground all the way. Cross-examined by Mr. Fenwick, witness said it was  	  dark at the time. He was quite sure there were no sidelights on the car  	  when it came along. Serrecchia and he were not larking in the roadway.  	  Clifford Preston (15), who was with Serrecchia and the previous witness,  	  gave his version of the affair. As Crowe and Serrecchia were crossing the  	  road to rejoin witness after the finding of the sixpence, he said, the car  	  swerved to the right. There were no lights on the car and he did not hear  	  any horn sounded. Serrecchia stopped and turned round and was facing the  	  car when it struck him. Witness noticed the rear light of the car after it  	  had knocked down the boy, but he could not say what happened to it  	  afterwards. The car was going at what he described as &#39;a good pace.&quot; He  	  was only able to see the boy under the car for a short distance, owing to  	  the darkness. In reply to Mr. Fenwick, witness admitted that the boy was  	  walking quickly across the road and had seen a car stop and then dodge in  	  front of it. A Juryman: Was there any struggle for possession of the  	  sixpence? Witness: No. John Thomas York, of Thornaby, said that he was  	  attracted by the shout. &quot;Oh! Tony&#39;s under the car.&quot; He had not previously  	  noticed the car. Witness could not say how many people were in it. He  	  jumped into the roadway and shouted. &quot;For Heaven&#39;s sake, stop! There is a  	  child under the car.&quot; The car was then nearly up to him and he ran after  	  it still shouting and waving his arms. &quot;Two men&quot; declared the witness &quot;who  	  were at the back of the car, raised themselves and turned their heads,  	  laughed and sat down. I don&#39;t know whether they saw me, but I thought I  	  had attracted their attention. I then shouted &#39;Stop&#39; and the car was then  	  about ten yards off.&quot; He heard no horn sounded and did not see any lights  	  on the rear, but could not swear as to whether there were any or not. &quot;I  	  followed the trail of blood,&quot; continued the witness &quot;going up Parliament  	  Street, Edward Street, Park Road, Yarm Road to Hartburn Bridge, the trail  	  ceased. The distance is about two miles.&quot; [piece now missing,  	  indecipherable] Dr. J.E.M. Pedlow, the acting police surgeon, said  	  that he was called to the garage by Elliott, and there found Inspector  	  Heald. The body was lying under the car. The head of the body was at the  	  rear of the car and feet towards the front. The body was almost naked, and  	  there were just remains of a cotton shirt and jersey wrapped round the  	  head. Elliott was present and was greatly perturbed. He said he knew  	  nothing until he got back to his garage, where a friend had drawn his  	  attention to the body. Elliott talked quite capably and intelligently, and  	  asked them to examine the car. He was sober. Witness made a post-mortem  	  examination. The injuries were consistent with the body having been caught  	  by the left foot and dragged face downwards along the road. In reply to  	  the foreman of the jury, witness said that Elliott did not smell of drink.  	  The speed of the car was estimated by Harold Wright, of Stockton-on-Tees,  	  to be ten miles an hour as it went along Parliament Street. He heard the  	  horn sounded twice. The car&#39;s lamps were alight.&quot; <br>- The  	  Yorkshire Evening Post, Thursday, 27 August 1925.<br><br>&quot;There  	  was a development to-day in connection with the Stockton motor-car  	  tragedy, the inquest proceedings of which concluded late last night, when  	  George Washington Elliott, of 53, Lothian-road, Middlesbrough, was  	  arrested this morning on a charge of manslaughter. It was intimated to  	  Elliott at the close of the inquest on Giovanni Serracchia, whose  	  mutilated body was found underneath his car, that the Stockton police had  	  a warrant for his arrest. As the result of an arrangement with  	  Superintendent T. Hammond, of the Stockton Division of the Durham County  	  Constabulary, Elliott presented himself at the Stockton police station  	  this morning, where he was arrested and charged. His answer to the charge  	  was one of &#39;Not guilty,&#39; and he was brought before a special sitting of  	  the Stockton magistrates, and evidence of his arrest was given. Mr. T.  	  Jackson, instructed by the police, appeared for the prosecution, and the  	  accused was represented by Mr. Robson, of Messrs. Punch and Robson,  	  solicitors, Middlesbrough. Mr. Jackson suggested that substantial bail  	  should be offered and mentioned that they would be satisfied with one  	  surety of &pound;500 and the accused in &pound;500. It was pointed out by  	  Mr Robson that the facts of the case had been investigated elsewhere, and  	  his client had a complete answer to the charge. He was not likely to run  	  away, and was only to anxious to meet the charge. He felt that the  	  requirements of the case would be met by his client&#39;s and another surety  	  of &pound;250. Bail was finally allowed on accused&#39;s surety of &pound;500  	  and another surety of &pound;500. The latter was forthcoming from Mr. J.  	  Wesley Brown, of Middlesbrough, and the case was adjourned to Thornaby,  	  10th September.&quot; - The Yorkshire Post, Monday, 31 August  	  1925.<br>&quot;The magisterial inquiry into the charge of  	  manslaughter against George Washington Elliott was resumed at  	  Stockton-on-Tees on Monday afternoon. For Elliott, Mr. C.B. Fenwick  	  cross-examined Superintendent Hammond (of Stockton) as to a broken  	  headlamp and an indentation and scratches which the witness found on  	  examining Elliott&#39;s car that day after the fatality. Witness would not  	  admit that the broken lamp was of old standing, though he admitted an  	  indentation on the rim of the lamp was.&quot; - The Echo, Monday,  	  14 September 1925.<br><br>&quot;George Washington Elliott, cargo  	  superintendent, was at Durham Assizes to-day acquitted of the charge of  	  manslaughter arising out of the death of a Stockton boy. Mr. Waugh,  	  defending, contended there was no evidence to go to the jury of such gross  	  carelessness and negligence as would justify a verdict of manslaughter.  	  Evidence pointed to the conclusion that the car did not knock the boy  	  down, but that he slipped down and thus got under the car. Mr. Justice  	  Fraser said the case must go on. Among witnesses for the defence were  	  three men riding in Elliott&#39;s car. All categorically denied that they knew  	  that anybody was knocked down by the car, that they heard any shouting, or  	  that anything of any kind took place which indicated that the boy had been  	  knocked down or was being dragged underneath. Elliott said he had not the  	  slightest knowledge that anything wrong had happened until the car was  	  garaged.&quot; - Northern Daily Mail, Friday, 13 November 1925.<br> 	  <br>&quot;George Washington Elliott was a passenger in a motor-car  	  with which a motor-combination collided on Friday night, with fatal  	  results to George Adamson, aged 19, who was in the sidecar. Mr Elliott,  	  accompanied by his wife, was a passenger in the car, which was driven by  	  W. Kenyon, of Middlesbrough. The motor-combination apparently hit the rear  	  of the car, and William Charles Pipe, a butcher, the driver of the former,  	  and Adamson were hurled on to the footpath. The car stopped, and Adamson  	  was conveyed to North Ormesby Hospital, where he died.&quot; -  	  The Courier and Advertiser, Monday, 21 June 1926.<br><br>&quot;The  	  inquest was concluded at Middlesbrough this afternoon on Thos. Adamson  	  (19), of Wicklow Street, Middlesbrough, who was killed in a motor accident  	  near Marton Bungalow. He was a passenger in a motor-cycle combination,  	  driven by Chas. Pipe, butcher, which crashed into the rear of a motor-car  	  owned by George Elliott. The evidence showed that the combination was one  	  which had been offered for purchase to Pipe, who was testing it at the  	  time of the accident. It was stated that the marks showed that the motor  	  cycle had travelled 74 yards after the impact. One witness said he saw  	  Adamson thrown into the air, and that he dropped back on to the side car.  	  Pipe said that he followed the motor-car for some distance, and gradually  	  overtook it. Deciding to pass it, he drew out to the right. At the same  	  time the motor-car also turned to the right and forced him further out.  	  When he got round the car he saw a cyclist approaching about six yards  	  away. He jammed on his brakes, and in trying to get to the rear of the  	  motor-car again, the side-car struck the motor-car. A verdict of  	  &#39;accidental death&#39; was returned, the jury being unanimously of the opinion  	  that Pipe had committed an error of judgement.&quot; - Northern  	  Daily Mail, Tuesday, 29 June 1926.<br><br>&quot;George Washington  	  Elliott (38), cargo superintendent, of 53 Lothian-road, Middlesbrough, was  	  charged at Middlesbrough on Monday with being drunk in charge of a motor  	  car. Mr. A. Lauriston asked for an adjournment, as he had only been  	  instructed for the defence that morning. The police offered no objection,  	  and Elliott was remanded on bail.&quot; - The Daily Mail, Tuesday,  	  7 September 1926.<br><br>&quot;George Washington Elliott was fined &pound;25  	  and had his license suspended for twelve months, at Middlesbrough, on  	  Wednesday, for being drunk in charge of a motor car. Mr Henry Riches, the  	  Chief Constable, said that on Saturday last a police constable saw  	  defendant leave an hotel and stagger across the road to his motor-car.  	  Along with three other persons, Elliott entered the vehicle, took hold of  	  the driving wheel. and endeavoured to start the engine. The constable, an  	  inspector, and a sergeant went to the car and attempted to persuade  	  Elliott, who was drunk, to leave the vehicle. He refused to get out, and  	  declared he was going to drive the car home. He was then forcibly removed  	  and taken to the police station. Mr Reuben Cohen, who defended, admitted  	  that Elliott was drunk, but called witnesses to prove that he had no  	  intention of driving the car, and that if he had had those who were with  	  him would not have allowed him to do so. The Stipendiary, in passing  	  sentence, said the fact that Elliott&#39;s friends might not have allowed him  	  to drive had saved him from prison. He was undoubtedly drunk in charge of  	  the car.&quot; - The Daily Mail, Thursday, 9 September 1926.</font></div>
