However, he has been very supportive of Stan so he is at the game on merit. He was comically booed by some sections of the support (unnecessary) but no problems.<br>  </li><li>  Martin O&rsquo;Neill and Kenny Dalglish took charge of the teams at the legends&rsquo; match to celebrate the career of Stiliyan Petrov.   </li><li>  An emotional afternoon at Paradise. Applause in the 19th minute of the match for Stiliyan.   </li><li>  The funds raised helped others across the country facing a similar diagnosis to Stiliyan. In addition, Celtic Charity made a donation to Glasgow NE Foodbank, which will open in September in response to growing levels of food poverty impacting men, women and children across the North and East of the city.<br>  </li><li>  Teenage girls and funny mummys jump to come to the game due to attendance on field of a teen idol from &#39;One Direction&#39; (a popular contemporary beat combo). They then sent death threats via twitter to one player on the field for a tackle made on him. Ridiculous! He puked up straight after when he went onto the sidelines.   </li><li>  Among the other celebrities were John Bishop, who spurned his chance of glory when his penalty was saved by Rab Douglas, while Nicky Byrne, the former Westlife singer, netted a late goal for the Siliyan XI. And actor Warren Brown also got on the scoresheet, scoring for the Hoops in the game. Fellow actors, Stevie Graham and Martin Compston also turned out for the Hoops, while Glasvegas frontman James Allan looked impressive for Stiliyan&rsquo;s XI.   </li><li>  Celtic fan Ricky Burns from Coatbridge retained his world title boxing belt after a draw in title match the night before.</li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Review<img align="right" alt="2013-09-08: Celtic XI 3-5 Stiliyan XI, Friendly - Pic" height="392" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/ZkgkbV4javIZ6f9RP6eDLw74615/GW472H392" title="2013-09-08: Celtic XI 3-5 Stiliyan XI, Friendly - Pic" width="472"></h3><b>Stan Petrov</b>: &quot;Today u showed the world how special u r. Thx for standing by me when I had the hardest time of my life.&quot;  <br><b>Bernie Slaven</b> &rlm;:&quot;Celtic fans confirm what I&#39;ve always known. They are the Greatest Good luck to Stan and the 60,000 sell out crowd for today&#39;s charity game.&quot;<br><b>Kenny Daglish</b>: &quot;What a fantastic privilege to be part of a truly emotive day at Celtic Park today. Unbelievable support from the fans for a very brave man.&quot;<br><br>(CelticElvis of KDS forum)<br>Just got back from Glasgow and had to, like many that were there, come on here to say what an incredible day it was. I&#39;ve always been proud to be a Celtic man, always have something Celtic on wherever I go, but it is on occasions like this that you really understand what it is to be part of such a special club. I&#39;ve just turned fifty and I had two of my daughters with me and like many have said, seeing Stan&#39;s kids run onto the field to him, brings home the really important things in life. My kids have rarely seen me in tears and they found it strange to see all the grown men around them in a similar state but they too were carried along with the emotion of it all. Some of the lads on here were talking about the booing but it genuinely was all a bit of fun. I had new glasses with me today and had trouble making out quite a few of the players on the field but there was no mistaking Henrick, he still has the movement as well as the mind of a great footballer. Lubo also performed well I thought and the sight of BoBo diving into a few tackles had me flinching way up in the back of the stand. I spent the match taking the mick out of my youngest daughter, Louie is her favorite but I can confirm that see did not tweet any death threats. She was hoping that the 1D guy would do better than the other boyband participant from Westlife but all he managed to do was throw up. At the end of the day it was all about recognizing the bravery and courage of a Celtic Hero and by God did we do it the Celtic way. Most of us have lost loved ones to that terrible disease and it was great to see a courageous man give it the two fingers, plus with the funds raised many more kids will be able run to their parents arms like we saw today. Finally just saw a clip on the news showing Stiliyan salute the fans and a brief image of an emotional NL as well, fabulous scenes and hopefully somebody on here may be able to post a few videos or images from the day. One last comment, I thought Jackie McNamara was great today I&#39;d re sign him as cover for Izzy!<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><b>CELTIC XI</b> <b>Squad</b><br>Tom Boyd<br>Momo Sylla<br>Tosh McKinlay<br>Jackie McNamara<br>Joos Valgaeren<br>Bobo Balde<br>Henrik Larsson<br>Morten Wieghorst<br>Chris Sutton<br>Pierre Van Hooijdonk<br>Jorge Cadete<br>Tommy Johnson<br>Brian McClair<br>Bobby Petta<br>Martin Compston<br>Didier Agathe<br>Neil Lennon<br>Rab Douglas<br>Stevie Graham<br>Warren Brown<br>Lubo Moravcik<br>Johan Mjallby<br>Louis Tomlinson<br><br><b>STILIYAN XI Squad</b><br>Brad Friedel<br>Radostin Kishishev<br>Freddie Bouma<br>Marian Hristov<br>Richard Dunne<br>Chris Kamara<br>Nicky Byrne<br>Robert Pires<br>Dimitar Berbatov<br>Jamie Redknapp<br>Gabriel Agbonlahor<br>Hristo Yovov<br>Paul Lambert<br>Patrik Berger<br>Roy Keane<br>Martin Petrov<br>Gareth Barry<br>Stiliyan Petrov<br>John Bishop<br>Habib Beye<br>Carlos Cuellar<br>John Terry<br>Shay Given <br><br><b>Referee</b>: <br><b>Attendance</b>: 60,000<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  Match Report (see end of page below)   </li><li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://www.spreaker.com/user/homebhoys/paradise_report_46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Audio Report: Paradise Report</a><br></li></ul>  <h3>  Pictures </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a href="/page/2013-09-08%3A+Celtic+XI+3-5+Stiliyan+XI%2C+Friendly+-+Pictures" target="_self">Match Pictures </a></li></ul>  <h3>  Forum</h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/forum/15914" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match </a>  </li><li>  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8799001/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Petrov Thread</a><br></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles</h3><h3>Charity the winner as Paradise pays tribute to Stiliyan  </h3><br>By: Mark Henderson on 08 Sep, 2013 16:14<br><br>Siliyan Petrov #19 Legends Charity Match<br>Celtic Park, Glasgow<br>Sunday, September 8, 2013<br><br>CELTIC XI&hellip;3<br>Larsson 10 pen. Van Hooijdonk 73 Brown 81<br><br>STILIYAN XI&hellip;5<br>Berbatov 1, 39, 58 M. Petrov 16, Byrne 89<br><br>YET again, Celtic supporters have proved they are special. On a Sunday afternoon in September, a remarkable sell-out crowd of 60,000 gathered in Paradise for a charity match and to salute Stiliyan Petrov.<br><br>It is hard to imagine any other football club holding such an extraordinary event, but Celtic fans are proud of their club&acute;s charitable foundations and they never forget their heroes, particularly in times of need.<br><br>From the first moment Stan was diagnosed with leukaemia in March 2012, they rallied behind the brave Bulgarian, whose courage and positivity in his fight with such life-threatening illness has simply been inspirational.<br><br>Now, thankfully, in remission, this was the Celtic fans&acute; opportunity to pay tribute to a wonderful footballer and a wonderful person. And that they did.<br><br>Players from both sides &ndash; a Celtic XI and Stiliyan XI &ndash; received a rapturous reception as they entered the pitch but the loudest cheer was reserved for Stiliyan who was accompanied by his children, Stiliyan Jnr and Kristiyan.<br><br>As the Bulgarian took the acclaim of the crowd, they burst into a stirring rendition of You&acute;ll Never Walk Alone. It was a poignant and uplifting start to a memorable occasion in Paradise.<br><br>In the 19th minute, the referee allowed a pause in proceedings as supporters rose again en mass to applaud the former Hoops midfielder and chant his name.<br><br>And once the 30-minute mark was reached it was time to raise the roof again as he exited to the bench to be replaced by English internationalist Gareth Barry.<br><br>With five minutes left on the clock, Stan re-entered the fray, this time wearing the Hoops. And at full-time he addressed the Celtic Park faithful to sound his appreciation.<br><br>&quot;First, thank you very much, all the support and everything you have done for me throughout my career,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Today you showed the world how special this place is. You made it special for me, my family and these players and thank you for standing by me.&quot;<br><br>The main beneficiaries of the event were Stan&acute;s charity foundation and the Trussell Trust, who run Foodbanks across the country. A number of other good causes will also be assisted through the work of Celtic Charity.<br><br>Amid the show of support for Stan, there was also an entertaining game of football on show for the capacity crowd to enjoy as a number of the Bulgarian&acute;s former team-mates, high-profile players and celebrities gave up their own time to take part in the contest.<br><br>Martin O&acute;Neill and Kenny Dalglish returned to the dugouts for the Celtic XI and Stiliyan XI, respectively, while the likes of Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton, Lubo Moravcik, Neil Lennon, Paul Lambert and Johan Mjallby strutted their stuff in Celtic Park once again.<br><br>Helped by a hat-trick from English Premier League star, Dimitar Berbatov, it finished 5-3 to the Stiliyan XI.

Not everyone got the memo, however, with Bobo Balde careering into the sort of wholehearted challenges that were the trademark of his Celtic career. One early rattle into the back of Robert Pires left the Frenchman checking both legs were still intact, while another challenge on Dimitar Berbatov drew a trademark scowl from the Fulham man.<br><br>Not even the surprise admission that he has been a bhoy since he was a boy prevented John Terry from getting booed throughout the game, presumably to the relief of Carlos Cuellar who, despite being a former Rangers player, seemed to avoid the catcalls. Terry almost scored the goal of the game, striking the base of the post with a shot from his own half.<br><br>The volume of booing was nothing compared to the ear-splitting shrieks that welcomed One Direction&#39;s Louis Tomlinson on to the pitch as a first-half substitute, the pop singer arriving just in time to prevent an army of prepubescent and teenage girls storming the dug-out to ask why manager Martin O&#39;Neill had not put on their favourite yet. Tomlinson did not stay on for long, however, and Gabriel Agbonlahor may find a fatwa declared on him this morning for the bone-crunching tackle that brought a premature end to little Louis&#39; afternoon, the singer pausing only long enough to be sick at the side of the pitch before hobbling up the tunnel.<br><br>Here was further proof that nostalgia never gets old. The returning heroes in the Celtic XI m anaged by O&#39;Neill were all welcomed warmly back into the fold, none more so than Henrik Larsson, whose movement and touch might have alerted a few SPFL Premiership teams still looking for a striker. The Swede saw a lob just miss the target, scored a penalty, then had a second &#39;goal&#39; ruled out early in the second half. The Petrov XI had the distinct advantage that many of their squad are still actively playing or not long retired.<br><br>Berbatov simply oozed class, scoring within 40 seconds, adding a second before the half was out, then completing a hat-trick in the second half. Against ageing and tiring Celtic legs, it almost seemed a bit cruel. Throw in Terry, Gareth Barry, Agbonlahor, Cuellar, and Martin Petrov, who also scored, and it was very much a case of men against much older men.<br><br>The old men, though, did all right. Rab Douglas saved comedian John Bishop&#39;s penalty, and Pierre van Hooijdonk and Warren Brown made it 4-3, before singer Nicky Byrne concluded the scoring at 5-3 with a low shot past Douglas.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>One Direction&#39;s Louis Tomlinson to get Gabriel Agbonlahor apology<br>BBC<br>9 September 2013 Last updated at 10:16 <br><br>Aston Villa striker Gabriel Agbonlahor is to apologise for the tackle on Louis Tomlinson that left the One Direction singer sick on the touchline.<br><br>The pair were playing in a charity match at Celtic Park organised by former footballer Stiliyan Petrov.<br><br>&quot;It was one of those things,&quot; said Agbonlahor. &quot;I&#39;ll apologise to Louis when we meet up.<br><br>&quot;I know he enjoyed playing in the game and it&#39;s fantastic that he took time out to be here.&quot;<br>Louis Tomlinson struggles on the sidelines at Celtic Park<br><br>Tomlinson was left struggling on the sidelines at Celtic Park following the tackle<br><br>Agbonlahor, who was a team-mate of Petrov&#39;s at Aston Villa, received abuse from One Direction fans on Twitter after the game for the tackle.<br><br>Tomlinson this season signed for his local club Doncaster Rovers on a non-contract basis to play reserve games after impressing in another charity match.<br><br>Boy band One Direction last year became the first British group to debut on top of the Billboard 200 list when their Up All Night album sold more than 175,000 copies during the first week of release in the United States.<br><br>They have recently been promoting their own movie and fragrance, with their third album due out in late November, but the singer&#39;s football injury should not affect tour plans as their next concert is not scheduled until May 2014, in Dublin.<br><br>Tomlinson&#39;s participation, along with Westlife singer Nicky Byrne and other celebrities, helped boost the attendance to a capacity 60,000 in Glasgow for a game organised to raise money for the Stiliyan Petrov Cancer Foundation, set up by the former Bulgaria international who retired in May having been diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012.<br><br>But the 21-year-old&#39;s appearance, with the number 1D on the back of his shirt, ended prematurely when he was left hobbling from a tackle and was sick on the sidelines as he was substituted.<br><br>Martin O&#39;Neill, the former Aston Villa and Celtic manager who was his boss for the day, said: &quot;Agbonlahor smashed into him and he picked himself up and then was ill in the dressing-room area, but he&#39;s not too bad now I think.<br><br>&quot;He had to rush off, but I think he&#39;s fine.<br><br>&quot;He doesn&#39;t know where he is, but he&#39;s fine.

Both sides included a number of Stan&acute;s former team-mates at Celtic and Aston Villa, high-profile footballers and celebrities. All were keen to take part.<br><br>Stiliyan&acute;s charity foundation, the Trussell Trust, who run Foodbanks across the country, and several other good causes through Celtic Charity will benefit from the occasion.<br><br>It was a memorable day for the former Celtic and Aston Villa favourite and Martin O&acute;Neill felt he was thoroughly deserving of such a touching tribute.<br><br>&quot;Stiliyan asked me a number of weeks ago that he was helping to organise a game here at Celtic,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought it was a fantastic idea and I am just astonished at the reception. I really shouldn&rsquo;t be, but it was absolutely fantastic, and he deserved it.<br><br>&quot;When I came here first of all, Stiliyan had been here about a year. He was excellent for me. After a while, I took him down to Aston Villa and even though he had a magnificent debut against West Ham, he had a difficult time there for a while.<br><br>&quot;It looked as though it might not work out but he fought through it as he has done his career and came out the other side and he&acute;s revered down at Villa as well now.<br><br>&quot;I can&acute;t really speak much more about him other than I have enormous respect for him. His generosity in every aspect of life is phenomenal &ndash; it really is. The players at Villa had great time for him as well.&quot;<br><br>The former Celtic and Aston Villa boss, like the entire football world, was stunned on first hearing of Stiliyan&acute;s diagnosis with leuakemia. And he was full of admiration by the bravery he showed as he fought the illness.<br><br>&quot;I had seen Stiliyan a number of times and he wasn&acute;t in great shape,&quot; said the Irishman. &quot;He was fighting strongly and, of course, I knew the professor he was working with him at the time. I knew he was in very good hands and had to battle through it.<br><br>&quot;First of all, you are not expecting someone as fit as he was, in a sport he was involved in, to be struck down in the manner in which he was. It came rather suddenly.<br><br>&quot;One day it looked as though he was feeling tired and the next day he was feeling tired and the next day he was being diagnosed with cancer. It&acute;s tough to take that in and then going through the treatments.<br><br>&quot;No doubt, there was many a moment when he was very badly down. But he came through it. He has a great family behind him and the medical staff were terrific as well.<br><br>&quot;He&acute;s had lots of support and I think that was very important to him. He said that himself and here today, it just manifested itself. It was phenomenal.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>King Kenny: A fitting tribute to Stan<br><br>By: Mark Henderson on 08 Sep, 2013 17:44<br><br>KENNY Dalglish believes the incredible show of support that Stiliyan Petrov received in Paradise today was a fitting tribute to a courageous and inspirational person.<br><br>A sell-out crowd in Celtic Park turned up to pay tribute to the brave Bulgarian following his recent fight with leukaemia in a friendly between a Celtic XI and a Stiliyan XI, who were managed by King Kenny.<br><br>In front of a carnival atmosphere, charity was the main winner as a number of good causes benefited including Stan&acute;s own charity foundation and the Trussell Trust.<br><br>Many other good causes will also be assisted through the work of Celtic FC Foundation &ndash; the club&acute;s charity.<br><br>And speaking after the match, the Celtic legend said: &quot;Stiliyan served here for seven years and they appreciated everything he did for them, as they do for everyone who comes along and try their best for the football club.
