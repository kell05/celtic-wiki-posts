So he could not have expected the then  Leicester manager&#39;s further explanation of why he was such a fan.<br><br>To  paraphrase, it went along the lines of &#39;You can&#39;t sing, you can&#39;t  really dance - but you&#39;ve made something out of what little talent  you&#39;ve got, becoming the most successful of all the fellas in Take That,  brilliant&#39;.<br><br>Apart from reinforcing his status as the natural  successor to Brian Clough, at least verbally, that little interlude  revealed something about the affable Irishman&#39;s idiosyncratic approach  to football management.<br><br>Put simply, he makes players - and teams -  better than they have any right to be. This pupil of Clough did it at  Wycombe, achieved even greater success  at Leicester - and has now begun  to spin gold from straw at Celtic, a club mired in perpetual crisis  until his arrival this summer.  The weekend&#39;s 6-2 trouncing of Rangers, a  result which sent shock waves through all of Britain and sent the  defeated side scurrying into the transfer market, was the most  compelling evidence yet that O&#39;Neill&#39;s methods can work in even the most  demanding environment.<br><br>To gain an insight into exactly how  O&#39;Neill gets his mojo working, you need only know a little about recent  events in the dressing room at Parkhead. Arguably the most important  speech he has ever delivered came there three weeks ago, when he  gathered the entire first-team squad for a meeting which would change  the mindset of a group left demoralised and demotivated by the John  Barnes experiment.<br><br>&#39;Gentlemen,&#39; declared O&#39;Neill, &#39;I will always  be 100 per cent honest with you and the Press. But in the coming weeks  you will hear me tell a lie. When asked by the media if we can win the  League, I will say no, that we are too young and still developing as  team and manager. &#39;Disregard it. We will win the League. Some of you  believe it already and all of you will believe it shortly.&#39;<br><br>Perhaps  not quite up there with Henry V at Agincourt - but powerful stuff all  the same. It was also exactly what the team needed after two years of  division and disorganisation under, first Dr Jo Venglos, and then  Barnes, as Rangers consolidated domestically and progressed in Europe  with Dick Advocaat at the helm.<br><br>More mind games were to come on  the eve of O&#39;Neill&#39;s first Old Firm game, when he called the squad  together, looked every player in the eye individually and delivered  concise instructions about tactics, then asked the group if they were  going to win. Only when a resounding cry of &#39;yes&#39; had died away did the  manager reveal that, had any player hesitated or uttered a treasonous  &#39;maybe&#39;, they would have been dropped on the spot.<br><br>In the tunnel  before the game, O&#39;Neill had injected so much enthusiasm into his  players that they were screaming as they waited for the Sky director to  let them take the field. Their opponents did not know how to respond  and, after Celtic&rsquo;s win, one of the Rangers players privately confessed:  &#39;Standing in the tunnel, seeing and hearing the Celtic players so fired  up, we knew we would lose.&#39;<br><br>But O&#39;Neill is more than just a  cheerleader, a Mr Motivator who restricts himself to praise and pumping  up players. A mere 45 minutes into his first game in charge of Celtci,  his charges 2-1 down to European giants Bray Wanderers, he walked into  the dressing room, took off his glasses - a sure sign of an explosion to  come, as the Leicester boys will testify - and let fly.<br><br>Celtic  and Scotland star Paul Lambert, a European Cupwinner with Borussia  Dortmund, admitted: &#39;That&#39;s when we knew that this guy had it, that he  was for real.&#39;<br><br>After the Bray game, O&#39;Neill displayed his  ruthless streak by singling out Brazilian defender Rafael to tell him:  &#39;We are the same, you and me.&#39; The smile on the South American&#39;s face  disappeared when the manager, in front of the team, added: &#39;I&#39;m 48 and I  can do everything you can do.&#39;<br>Rafael has not enjoyed much playing time since.<br><br>Neither  has Eyal Berkovic, the cornerstone of Barnes&#39; recruitment plan but long  suspected as a disruptive element in the squad, played a significant  part as O&#39;Neill put spirit ahead of even the most outrageous talent.<br><br>He  took a major chance by spending &pound;6million on Chris Sutton, just as he  had gambled on Stan Collymore at Leicester and, long before him, the  likes of Steve Guppy. Sutton has responded with five goals in four  games, pushing him to the fringes of the England squad.<br><br>O&#39;Neill  loves a lost cause, a player no-one else rates, and it is remarkable to  note that Celtic winger Bobby Petta - not exactly a star at Ipswich and a  total flop in Glasgow last year - is now the subject of encouraging  noises from Holland boss Louis van Gaal.<br><br>As far as we can tell,  O&#39;Neill is not indulging in black magic, or even applying some  complicated psychological theory to group dynamics. Something of his  style has been taken from Clough, who used to regularly pillory O&#39;Neill  for lack of ability by way of motivation, while the rest seems like  fairly basic man-management.<br><br>The fact that most of his Leicester  players could have predicted virtually everything he has done in his  first days at Celtic also indicates that he is just sticking to a simple  plan.<br><br>So maybe his secret lies in personality, hardly a problem  area for this part-time BBC talking head. Whatever the miracle quality  is, O&#39;Neill has it - and every club in the country wants it.<br>His  remarkable record at Leicester had already assured O&#39;Neill a place at  the top of the candidates&#39; list virtually every time a major Premiership  club was seeking a new manager.<br><br>In the two years before finally  making the rather bemusing leap north to Celtic, he knocked back Leeds,  Everton and an emotionally tempting offer to return to Nottingham  Forest, where he had enjoyed so much playing success under Clough.<br><br>So  you can guarantee that, within hours of the next high-profile  departure, O&#39;Neill&#39;s phone will be ringing, though most chairmen are  smart enough to realise that he is able to pick and choose his next job.<br><br>He  could opt for Leeds at the second opportunity, should David O&#39;Leary  leave for greener pastures in London, or he might even appeal to Arsenal  if Monsieur Wenger heads east. And surely the Manchester United board  must, with Sir Alex&#39;s retirement looming, look favourably on the record  of a man who can balance a budget and engender a fighting team spirit.<br><br>In fact, probably the only job he is not in the running for is chairman of Robbie Williams&#39; fan club.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class="diffAdd">Republic of Ireland manager Martin O&#39;Neill makes players feel like a million dollars... you would run through a brick wall for him</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span></h3><br><a class="external" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4967548/Martin-O-Neill-makes-players-feel-like-million-dollars.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0563c1" face="Calibri" size="3"><span class="diffAdd">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4967548/Martin-O-Neill-makes-players-feel-like-million-dollars.html</span></font></a><br><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> History has proved you should never write off a team managed by Martin O&#39;Neill</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Ireland reached the 2018 World Cup play-offs thanks to an away win over Wales</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> O&#39;Neill was the master of the dressing room as Celtic enjoyed major success</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> By Chris Sutton for the Daily Mail </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Published: 22:31, 10 October 2017</span></font><font color="#000000" size="3"><span class="diffAdd"> </span></font><font color="#000000" size="3"><span class="diffAdd">| Updated: 22:49, 10 October 2017</span></font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> You can never write off a Martin O&rsquo;Neill side. He always backs his teams to the hilt, and as a result his players run through brick walls for him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I first met Martin at a hotel in Beaconsfield to discuss a move from Chelsea to Celtic in the summer of 2000. I had endured a difficult year in London, scoring just once in the Premier League all season, but straight away Martin told me that did not bother him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He said that he had followed my career, knew my form would return and that if I worked hard for him, he would back me. It is such belief in his players which inspires them to give that little bit extra to the cause.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> When I played for him, Martin was not someone I felt you could get close to. He was difficult to read and you never knew what he was thinking, but when he gave you praise, it made you feel a million dollars.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Martin was the master of the dressing room. He never lost an argument and while he ruled with a strong hand, he was always fair. Henrik Larsson would often bail us out but Martin would not be afraid to rip into him if he felt things were not going right. Equally, he knew when to put an arm around someone who needed a confidence boost.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Where Martin has the X-factor is in his ability to galvanise and lift a group of players. He&rsquo;s done it pretty much everywhere he has managed.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He took over a Celtic side who had finished 21 points behind Rangers. In his first Old Firm derby, we thumped Rangers 6-2. In next to no time he transformed us into a dominant force domestically while on the European stage we were going toe-to-toe with the likes of Juventus, Liverpool and Barcelona.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Now, with the Republic of Ireland, he has got a group of players from middling Premier League and Championship clubs well and truly punching above their weight.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> This is one of the weakest Ireland teams I can remember and yet Martin has taken them to the brink of qualification for the World Cup.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Wales may have been without Gareth Bale on Monday night but what about the players Martin was missing? Without Jon Walters and Shane Long, Ireland had to rely on 34-year-old Nottingham Forest striker Daryl Murphy to lead their line. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> In Cardiff, Ireland were extremely well organised, dogged and hard to beat. Martin has had to put up with a lot of stick about how Ireland do not play attractive football but he does not listen to all the outside noise. He does what is necessary to get results.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Martin surrounds himself with people he can trust implicitly. At Celtic, Steve Walford was the coach and John Robertson was his sounding board.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I can imagine plenty of managers would not want Roy Keane in their backroom team given how outspoken he can be but Martin is not worried about reputation. He simply wants the best people around him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> People have unfairly criticised Martin for not &lsquo;coaching&rsquo; his teams.
