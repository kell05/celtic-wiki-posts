Strictly it should be only about matches between the champions of the respective top leagues, but it makes for easy &#39;sensational&#39; journalism to slap the label to any fixtures possible. The death of the old annual Scotland v England Rous Cup match means the club matches have a greater significance to some for testing our steel in these games. </div><br>However, rivalry is part of life and sporting challenges are a way to celebrate our differences, and matches between Scottish sides v English sides has been an intriguing neighbourhood battle. With the disparity of resources in recent years, David v Goliath might be a more appropriate tag. <br><br>In Scottish football the most celebrated &#39;<i>Battle of Britain</i>&#39; was the 1970 semi finals between ourselves and Leeds Utd in the European Cup. Leeds were marked as favourites for the match but things didn&#39;t go to plan for them as Celtic out fought and out played them in both legs to record a famous set of victories, which are as celebrated today as ever before. It was a real kick in the crotch for the English media, where one said beforehand he wouldn&#39;t want to be in Glasgow after our defeat to come. <br><br>There have been various other great matches &amp; tournaments involving Celtic and English sides which some may not be as celebrated and need mentioned. <br><br>One of the earliest challenges was the match between Celtic (League &amp; Cup winners) &amp; Burnley (FA Cup winners) in May 1914 for the Budapest Cup, the match being played in Hungary. As the UK was seen as the top of the sport, the battle between the respective Scottish and English sides was seen as a major championship. First match was drawn but Celtic triumphed in the replay back in Burnley (5 months later!) and received a commemorative vase for the victory in 1988 (the original trophy was raffled off to raise funds for the Red Cross at the beginning of the First World War, although other stories say it was lost).<br><br>One supposed &#39;friendly&#39; from 1912 even brought out on the pitch one of the finest retorts from a Celtic player during a match: <br><blockquote><i>The  game [Celtic 1-1 Barnsley 3 Sep 1912] was anything but &#39;friendly&#39; with  Barnsley from Yorkshire were  (where they still boast about breeding  them tough with chips on both  shoulders) attacking Celtic rather than  tackling them in the relentless  rain. McMenemy, who normally never said  a great deal on the field or  afterwards complained to Utley about the  constant fouling. Utley said:  &quot;In English football, this team of yours  wouldn&#39;t last a month&quot;,  McMenemy replied by saying &quot;In Scottish  football, yours wouldn&#39;t last a  match&quot;.  </i><br></blockquote><br>As for other tournaments, the Exhibition Cup (1938) and Coronation Cup (1953) were specially staged as unofficial British championships as much as anything else, and Celtic gallantly triumphed in both. The Coronation Cup gave the club a fillip after many years in the doldrums. It&#39;s an irony, that it was Celtic that were crowned British champions of these tournaments, as the culture and supporters have been anything but sympathisers for the now defunct empire or royalty. It was a nice shot at the British jingoists with these victories.<br><br>Celtic winning the Dubai Cup v Liverpool in 1989 was a good moment but seeing as the rest of the season was so poor in 1988-89, (as against the sublime 1987-88 centenary season) the game has been much forgotten. In truth this match isn&#39;t deemed as having been as competitively fought as should have been by some, so it isn&#39;t as well regarded as could be. The Dubai Cup and the like have always been derided by some but it had its charms. Celtic being the last winners, as it was disbanded straight after <span class="diffRemove">our</span><span class="diffAdd">the</span> <span class="diffAdd">club&#39;s </span>win, still hold the <span class="diffRemove">cup!</span><span class="diffAdd">cup.</span> <br><br>Various other encounters have been marked incorrectly as Battle of Britain games. When Celtic faced Blackburn Rovers in the UEFA Cup in 2002-03, we might have been champions but Blackburn certainly weren&#39;t (far from it). It was a corny way for journos to hype the matches, but as Scottish sides (inc Celtic) had slipped so far behind in European tournaments this was thought by many (even in the Celtic support) as a major set of matches. The latter games v Liverpool in the same cup run were far more of a challenge, but again not really <span class="diffRemove">&#39;Battle</span><span class="diffAdd">&#39;</span><i><span class="diffAdd">Battle</span><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Italic"> of </span><span class="diffRemove">Britain&#39;.</span><span class="diffAdd">Britain</span></i><span class="diffAdd">&#39;.</span> <br><br>The Anglo-Scottish Dryborough Cup in the 1970s which saw uninterested Scottish clubs &amp; second rate English clubs compete in a KO tournament was better known for its trouble making potential off the pitch by various supporters and was never taken seriously at all as a competition (on-field at least). Very short-lived and most were to be thankful for that.<br><br>I
