His appearances at Aston Villa were limited due to injuries, so coming to Celtic he was to start with a clean sheet. <br><br>Having played already under Martin O&#39;Neil, MoN knew what he was to get from him but many of us didn&#39;t. A robust midfield player, he combined both fine play and aggression very well, and fast became a firm favourite amongst the fans. John Robertson, Celtic assistant coach, likened Thompson&#39;s passing to David Beckham&#39;s and described his left foot as &#39;the wand&#39;.   <br><br>A stalwart in the golden era under Martin O&#39;Neil, he more than played his part in guiding the club back to respectability, scoring 51 goals in his appearances for the club, and playing a strong role in Celtic&#39;s campaign in the UEFA Cup 2003. <br><br>It wasn&#39;t just the number of goals and games, it was also the quality. He twice scored the winner twice against Rangers, one of which is an oft replayed long shot screamer v the Huns. A hunskelper supreme, he scored seven goals against them, something that is often overlooked as all concentrate of for example Sutton or Larsson. <br><br>A physical player, he had the ability to put in needed tackles when required and helped to shore up the team on the pitch on many occasions. Some though whined that he was too one-footed, but what a foot that was!<br><br>Famously, he was known to have a running feud with arch-hun Fernando Ricksen (who was a very unfriendly neighbour where he lived), but Thompson more than got the upper hand against him in the games, including the famous &quot;knock-knock&quot; episode&quot; (see below).<br><br>Thommo&#39;s greatest moments were in Europe. Firstly, a misleading free-kick against Liverpool away (Road to Seville, UEFA Cup 2003), saw Thommo kick a strong low shot that bulletted beneath the jumping Liverpool defence into the back of the net. Up to that point, there were worries if we&#39;d make it through unscathed in the match. A fabulous strike. It wasn&#39;t just that strike, Celtic had beaten a top English club and it was a real knock to the critics of the Scottish league and beyond. <br><br>Must add that he was a major part of the team in the Road to Seville (UEFA Cup final 2003), and like many others in the team, he played out of his skin in a number of games.<br><br>However, his greatest moment was against Barcelona in the UEFA Cup run in 2004, scoring the winner in the home game which set Celtic up well for the return leg in the Nou Camp, where the first team fought out a no score draw to take the club through to the the next round, overcoming one of the top in-form sides in Europe at that time. Not his greatest personal goal for style but his goal was instrumental to the victory against Barcelona, and showed how fundamentally important he was to the team during Martin O&#39;Neil&#39;s reign, many of the players being overshadowed by the awe all felt for Sutton &amp; Larrson. The victory was the highpoint of Martin O&#39;Neil&#39;s reign at Celtic, and Thommo was centre stage.<br><br>As a reward and measure of his ability, Thompson earned an appearance for England under then manager Sven Goran Eriksson which made him the first Celtic player to be capped by England whilst playing for Celtic at the time (Chris Sutton never played for England whilst playing for Celtic). Sadly he didn&#39;t earn more caps as he deserved.<br><br>He scored the winning goal in the Scottish Cup final of 2005 to win Martin O&#39;Neill his last trophy with Celtic, and a good send-off it was too. It was apt that one of his first captures would be the one to seal the goodbye for O&#39;Neill, and Thommo more than befitted the role.<br><br>As happens, he ended up being at Celtic for a season or so too long and was never really in the first side (or squad even), and there were too many on the terracing bemoaning his lack of pace and subtlety on the pitch when he was there, making him an easy target. He was sent off in his last &quot;Celtic v Rangers&quot; match for a silly two footed lunge which sealed his exit from the first team. He admitted that whilst on the bench he ended up not even watching all through the matches (just wasn&#39;t him). He was transferred to Leeds in Jan 2007 where he had fitted in well and made himself popular.<br><br><h3>Post-playing</h3>He announced his retirement from playing football on 28th May 2008 (<a class="external" href="http://www.4thegame.com/club/leeds-united-fc/news/218906/thompson_calls_it_a_day.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>) ending his time with Leeds. He then moved on as a Youth Coach at Newcastle Utd Academy.<br><br>In June 2010 he was appointed as a a first team coach at Celtic under newly appointed manager Neil Lennon. They were both member of the team that played together in the UEFA Cup Final in 2003.<br><br>Tough seasons together, but they sealed the league title as a coaching team in season 2011/12 which was well deserved and made Thommo an even greater hero amongst the fans.<br><br>However, to the surprise of all in the Celtic support he was dismissed from his role on 3 June 2012 (not too amicable a split to be honest), not long after the end of season. He&#39;d not had an easy time of late, with a drink-driving charge and family issues making front page news but that&#39;s not for this site (the tabloids can have that stuff). <br><br>We wish him the best.<br>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTopWPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  The Knock-Knock story</h3>One &quot;*.gif&quot; that had done the rounds is of Alan Thompson going past a Rangers player and doing a &quot;knock-knock&quot; remark (as if chapping a door)! The story behind this is that the player in question was the the unpopular Fernando Ricksen (a complete headcase in his time as a player) who was Alan Thompson&#39;s next door neighbour, and apparently Ricksen was said not to be a great neighbour. <br><br>What occurred was that Ricksen decided one late night to chap on Thompson&#39;s door and wake him and his family up, and then proceeded to shout through his letter box! Charming.   <br><br><div>Anyhow, the mock remarks by Thompson on top of our victories against Rangers and his team i&#39;m sure made our victory for Thompson all the sweeter, and sourer for Ricksen. Ricksen was really a pantomime villain for many in the Celtic support. </div><div></div><br><div>Sadly in later years, Ricksen developed Motor Neuron disease, a terrible physically debilitating condition. The hatchet had been buried long back between the two, and there was support from across all of Glasgow wishing Ricksen all the strength in the world. Sadly passed away prematurely in 2019.</div><div><b>  </b></div><b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows

I know we&#39;ve noticed his his goals for Leeds - one on his debut, as well as a booking. How appropriate! I won&#39;t mince words. I loved the guy. He was a hothead with shaky discipline, but what a big match player he was! Although there&#39;s plenty of massive goals to choose from, my abiding memory of Alan Thompson will be a spectacularly violent clothesline tackle against Porto in the Seville final. <br><br>I wonder if anyone else remembers it? It happened during extra time, after Bobo&#39;s red and Derlei&#39;s go-ahead goal. The Porto players were falling over and writhing everywhere, Mourinho was bitching like a 13 year-old girl, and then Thommo went into a &quot;challenge&quot; on the touchline. He absolutely flattened somebody, might have been Capucho, and I recall roaring hoarsely at the incident. It seemed to capture and express all the frustration I was feeling.<br><br>That&#39;s what I loved about Thommo. So often his attitude on the pitch mirrored mine as a fan. The intensity that sometimes morphed into barely-suppressed rage. On several occasions that rage spilled over with negative consequence, most notably August 2005 at Ibrox. That was the beginning of Thommo&#39;s long goodbye. It&#39;s all over now, finally, but he&#39;s a player I&#39;ll never forget.<br><br>Godspeed Alan Thompson, you were a great Celt in your time. </div>  <div class="postcolor">  (1 Feb 2007)</div>  <div class="postcolor">    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Articles</h3><div class="LeadPara"><div class="Title"><h3>Thompson returns to Celtic as coach</h3></div> <div class="Provided"> <div>18 June 2010</div>Provided by: The Daily Telegraph</div><br>ALAN THOMPSON was heartbroken when Celtic manager Gordon  Strachan ended his six-year Parkhead career in 2006, although he admits that the  manner of his departure, rather than the timing, was what hurt the most.</div> <div class="LeadPara"><br>He was transferred to Leeds after scoring 51 goals in 227  appearances for the Hoops, becoming the first - and, thus far, only -Celtic  player to be capped by England while playing for the club.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Thompson, 36, left boyhood heroes Newcastle, where he had  been working with the reserves, to join Neil Lennon&#39;s revolution and, after  being officially unveiled as Celtic&#39;s new first-team coach yesterday, he spoke  of his disappointment at leaving four seasons ago.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;I left on a sour note,&quot; he said. &quot;I just walked out of a  side door one day without really saying goodbye to anyone.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;There were stories at the time about me being injured but  I wasn&#39;t. Gordon didn&#39;t want to use me in the preseason games and he knew how  unhappy I was so he gave me the opportunity to go home.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;It was a shock, though, flying back from Boston on my own  and knowing that was me done. It was the right time to go, although I wouldn&#39;t  have chosen those circumstances. Shaun Maloney and Aiden McGeady were coming  through and they had more in their lockers than I had by then.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;Gordon was sending me on for the last 5-10 minutes of our  pre-season matches but I&#39;m not going to slag him because he treated me like a  man. Not many managers would say: &#39;You know where we stand and I know how you&#39;re  feeling so go home if you want.&#39; &quot;It was the loneliest journey of my life and I  shed tears. Fortunately, the stewardesses made me feel better.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Thompson revealed that he and Lennon had arranged to work  as part of the same management team while they were still stoking the engine  room of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s side.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;We did our B licence together up here and we always had an  agreement that we&#39;d do this,&quot; he said. &quot;Neil knew that he wanted to be a manager  and it was my ambition to come back here - I just didn&#39;t think it would happen  this quickly.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;It was a wrench leaving Newcastle but I&#39;ve every  confidence that Neil will be a big, big success and part of the attraction is  helping the club come out of Rangers&#39; shadow again. Neil spoke to me when he  became caretaker last season but he realised that I couldn&#39;t leave St James&#39;  Park for just nine games.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&quot;I was in Dubai on holiday last week when he called to say  that he&#39;d got the manager&#39;s job and asked me to come up: it was an offer I  couldn&#39;t refuse.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>With Johan Mjallby waiting to be confirmed as Lennon&#39;s No2  and former Leicester City midfielder Garry Parker joining the backroom staff,  O&#39;Neill&#39;s influence will loom large.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>Celtic failed to even reach a cup final for the first time  since 1997 and surrendered the title to Rangers again. Thompson, recalling that  Dick Advocaat&#39;s team had won the title 18 points clear of Celtic before  O&#39;Neill&#39;s arrival a decade ago, stressed the need for big-game hunters at  Parkhead.</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>With nine goals to his credit (and three red cards),  Thompson knows the intensity of Old Firm rivalry. &quot;It&#39;s as much about mentality  as it is about skill,&quot; he said. &quot;Neil and I used to get abuse at Ibrox but we  both thrived on it. Next season the four games against Rangers will vital to the  outcome of the championship and we need strong players. It would be great to  have Sol Campbell around.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas"><br>&copy; 2010 Telegraph Group Limited, London</div> <div class="TailParas">The Daily Telegraph  <div class="postcolor">    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><img align="bottom" alt="Thompson, Alan - Pic" height="724" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/FFM5WVyNPmCozHslM6BQzQ238897/GW976H724" title="Thompson, Alan - Pic" width="976"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Thompson, Alan - Pic" height="380" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/w5ppRZQtMg9XiTMiyzjvRw107114/GW509H380" title="Thompson, Alan - Pic" width="509"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Thompson, Alan - Pic" height="530" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/tKiXiwBCcfIRlnlpnWnoEQ127328/GW382H530" title="Thompson, Alan - Pic" width="382"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Thompson, Alan - Pic" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/fr3DgyeMXMdUQSK6MdLH4w187338" title="Thompson, Alan - Pic"><br></div></div>

			<div style="margin-top:10px;">Alan was an honest hard working old fashioned footballer. He didn&#39;t have the style or hero worship of the likes of henrik but, when it mattered, he delivered. 
<br>Remember his wonder freekick against the gers August 04!!! 
<br>He never seemed to be a fans favourite, but even when the support was on his back due to his having an off day he didn&#39;t crumble under the abuse, he stood up and fought back. E.g. he was struggling against falkirk, suffered abuse and replied with 2 late goals to win the game for Celtic. He was a high earner who had to be removed from the wage bill. I wish him all the best, and thanks for 6 years of hard work.
<br>Cheers Alan</div>
