Maley knew different and the persuasive  official eventually convinced Quinn to come to Parkhead by ensuring him  he could travel each day from Croy on the train.<br><br>Quinn eventually signed provisional forms with Celtic on New Year&#39;s Eve 1900 and became a full time player 13 days later.<br><br>Maley&#39;s  persuasive efforts were to be greatly rewarded time and time again over  the next 15 years as Quinn became the most feared forward in the  Scottish game. His impact on the Bhoys was immediate - scoring on his  debut at St Mirren as Celtic ran out 4-3 winners in a league clash on  January 19th 1901.<br><br>Originally starting out as left-winger the  strong running player was converted into a centre-forward and it was in  this position the Mighty Quinn truly excelled. Uncompromisingly tough  and with the strength of a buffalo Quinn was an explosive talent with  both pace and a ferocious shot.<br><br>But even as a winger he knew his  way to goal. In his first Scottish Cup final (1901) he may have ended up  on the losing side but not before stealing the show with a wonder goal  which saw his pace and strength beat six Hearts player before scoring. <br><br>As  a centre-forward Quinn was a peerless power with no apparent weakness  to his game. Brave, quick, great aerial prowess, excellent awareness,  nimble feet and with a power-packed precision shot. <br><br>His  unrivalled ability as a centre-forward was perfectly illustrated in the  Scottish Cup final of 1904 when he bagged a hat-trick at Hampden as  Celtic came from 2-0 down to defeat Rangers 3-2. <br><br>The fearsome  firepower of this humble man from Croy was the foundation on which a  glorious era in Celtic&#39;s history was built. With the magnificent and  rampaging Quinn terrorising opponents Celtic were to win six League  championships in succession as well as adding four Scottish Cups to  their haul of silverware. The player was also capped 11 times for  Scotland.<br><br>Knee trouble eventually brought an end to this most  memorable of careers but not before this former collier boy made an  eternal impression on football history and in the hearts of all Celtic  fans for generations to come. Even as he headed to his playing retirement, he couldn&#39;t help but score. In his single league match in the title winning season of 1913-14 he scored a double over Morton in the league, and in his final season in 1914-15, he scored four goals in six league games as Celtic retained the league title.<br><br>Jimmy Quinn played 331 league &amp; Scottish Cup games for  Celtic and scored 216 goals in these games. His family connections continued with the  club, with his grandson (also n&eacute; <a href="/page/Quinn%2C+Jimmy+%281963-74%29" target="_self">Jimmy Quinn</a>)  playing for the club, however <span class="diffRemove">he</span><span class="diffAdd">this grandson</span> could not match his grandfather, and  played a relatively small number of games and never cemented a long-term  place in the first team.<br><br><span class="diffRemove">He</span><span class="diffAdd">Jimmy</span> <span class="diffAdd">Quinn </span>passed away in 1945, and Willie Maley penned a fitting valedictory on the Celtic legend: <br><blockquote>&quot;<i>He was the keystone in the greatest team Celtic ever had.</i>&quot;<br></blockquote><br>The Mighty Quinn is a Celtic icon who will never be forgotten, his incredible record will see to that.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Quotes</h3>&quot;He was the keystone in the greatest team the Celts ever had.&quot;

 Joe Hendry had just fouled Jimmy McMenemy, Quinn came charging across  towards him and slipped on the wet turf knocking Hendry to the ground  and landing accidentally on his face. Quinn was sent off and suspended  for 2 months.   <br><br>The Celtic fans thought this was a deliberate  ploy by the authorities to prevent Celtic becoming the first club to win  the Scottish league and cup in the same season. A supporters campaign  was started to compensate Quinn for his loss of earnings. A grand total  of &pound;277 was raised as money poured in from across Scotland, Ireland and  the USA. Concerts were held and Jimmy was presented along with the money  a gold watch and earrings for his wife Annie.<br><br>After Quinns suspension Celtic went on to win the double for the first time in Scottish football.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Another championship nailbiter thanks to mighty Quinn - </h3>Football   <br><br>Times, The (London, England)<br>May 19, 2005<br>Author: Alex Murphy<br><br>At  the end of the 1904-05 season, the Old Firm finished level on 41 points  each and, according to league rules, the teams had to play off for the  title. In hindsight, that seems a trifle harsh on Rangers, who had  scored 15 goals more than Celtic in the 26-match campaign and conceded  three fewer, but, nevertheless, they faced a title decider at Hampden  Park on May 6, 1905.<br><br>A crowd of over 30,000 saw Celtic win 2-1,  and it was a victory that swung the balance of power in Glasgow. Before  that winner-takes-all shoot-out, Rangers had won four of the previous  six championships but Celtic&#39;s triumph set up a run of six titles in a  row.<br><br>Although the Celtic goals that beat Rangers came from Jimmy  McMenemy, the inside right, and Davie Hamilton, the outside left, the  season really belonged to Jimmy Quinn, the centre forward, whose goals  kept Celtic in the hunt when Rangers appeared to be marching away with  the title. The campaign was a triumph for one of the most idiosyncratic  characters ever to wear the green and white hoops.<br><br>Away from the  park, Quinn was crippled by shyness and consumed by self-doubt. As a  promising youngster he had come to the notice of Willie Maley, the  Celtic manager, who made up his mind to sign the boy. But Quinn assured  Maley he was not good enough for the big league and he wanted to stay  with his pals in junior football.<br><br>Maley begged him to join  Celtic, and in the end he got his man with methods only just the right  side of chicanery. The move did not quell Quinn&#39;s diffidence his  nickname in the Celtic dressing-room was &quot;Jamie the Silent&quot;.<br><br>On  the field, though, Quinn became a warrior in the Celtic cause, willing  to fight his corner with the roughest defenders, and he would hobble  home after matches, his legs grotesquely swollen with cuts and  contusions.<br><br>All season long, Quinn maintained a running battle  with referees and markers, but his never-say-die attitude lay at the  heart of his team&#39;s success. In the Scottish Cup semi-final against  Rangers at Celtic Park he was sent-off for fighting. The decision  sparked a riot that brought the game to an early conclusion, and Celtic  were obliged to forfeit the game.<br><br>The incident stirred up so much  ill-feeling that a neutral English referee -Mr Kirkham from Preston  -was drafted in for the title play-off. The Scottish Football League  felt it would be impossible to find any referee in Scotland not infected  by the ill-will that ran between the two clubs.<br><br>Yet, for all his  problems with officialdom, the mighty Quinn managed to score 19 goals  in the 21 games for which he was not suspended. The tally included  hat-tricks against Port Glasgow Athletic and Motherwell, and a priceless  double in the penultimate game of the season, when Celtic beat Rangers  4-1 at Ibrox to drag themselves back into the championship reckoning.<br><br>Quinn&#39;s  battered limbs finally failed him in 1915, when he retired with his  place in the Celtic pantheon assured. He died in 1945, and Maley penned a  fitting valedictory: &quot;He was the keystone in the greatest team Celtic  ever had.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Star , Issue 8514, 5 January 1906, <br></h3><br><img align="bottom" alt="Quinn, Jimmy (1900-15) - The Celtic Wiki" height="893" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/77qu3N9nbRuTVG8jYOaXDQ52374/GW447H893" title="Quinn, Jimmy (1900-15) - The Celtic Wiki" width="447"><br><br>  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>JIMMY QUINN</h3><br>By David Potter (from KeepTheFaith website)<br><br>It  is now just over 100 years since Jimmy Quinn burst on to the Scottish  scene in a big way. This was the Scottish Cup Final of 1904. Imagine the  scene. 65,000 crowd (huge for 1904) and a new stadium hosting its first  big game. Hampden had been opened the previous Hallowe&#39;en, but had  still not yet convinced everyone that it was fit enough to host the  Scotland v England game in April 1904. Celtic Park still got the nod.<br><br>But  when Celtic and Rangers found themselves in the Scottish Cup Final of  April 16 th 1904 , clearly neither Ibrox nor Parkhead could be used.  Hampden it had to be.<br><br>Hampden and Quinn therefore emerged together, for Quinn scored a hat-trick to win the Scottish Cup.<br><br>Maley  had often wondered if he had made a mistake with Big Jimmy. He  certainly had the build; he came of a good, respectable Catholic family,  but seemed (curious for a man of that bulk) to lack confidence in  himself, preferring for example his home town of Croy to the thriving  metropolis of Glasgow . Maley had played him on the left wing, inside  left, occasionally in the centre, but without any great and sustained  success.<br><br>But centre forward it had to be, for Alec Bennett was  unsettled at Parkhead and Alec had been playing in the centre. Alec was a  Rangers supporter and was not happy to play against them in the 1904  Cup Final. So Quinn it had to be. His goals that day at Hampden were  magnificent, all scored through his sheer power to run at and apparently  through defenders. A hero was born.<br><br>From now on Quinn and Celtic  took off. The League Championship was won in the next six years, and  Quinn&#39;s apparent diffidence disappeared overnight. The Scottish Cup was  won in 1907, 1908, 1911 and 1912. Yet, although he scored 216 goals,  Quinn was more than merely a goal-scorer. He was a centre forward in the  old style in that he could forage for the ball, lead the line,  distribute to his wingers and frequently turn up on the wing himself to  rampage down either flank.<br><br>Nor did he disdain the rough stuff, a  very prevalent feature of Edwardian football. Twice he was ordered off  against Rangers, both times for retaliation when severely provoked, but  this merely made him all the more of a folk hero as concerts were held  by his devoted fans to compensate Jimmy for loss of earnings. On the  second occasion, after being dismissed on New Year&#39;s Day 1907, he came  back in March to play against Rangers and earned the plaudits of  everyone by simply walking away when kicked in the stomach by a Rangers  player.<br><br>Jimmy Quinn played 11 times for Scotland, his most famous  game being the 1910 International against England when he and Jimmy  McMenemy scored the goals that won the day for Scotland in front of a  six figure crowd.<br><br>After 1910, injuries began to catch up with  Quinn, and by the outbreak of World War One, his career had more or less  finished. Yet even when not playing for the team, he turned up and  helped the trainer to &ldquo;carry the hamper&rdquo; off the train at away games,  sometimes smoking a clay pipe and looking &ldquo;just like an ordinary man&rdquo;.<br><br>Indeed he returned to ordinary life in the pits of  <br></div>
