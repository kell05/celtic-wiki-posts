Danny McGrain, who had been covering at left back to accommodate Alan Sneddon, moved to his natural right back position and Sneddon moved to Hibs. The balance of McGrain and Mark Reid at full back was better and served Celtic well.<br><br>An assured and steady defender Mark Reid established himself as the regular left-back under McNeill and by <a href="/page/1982" target="_self">1982</a> had even become the club&rsquo;s first choice penalty taker. Reid was a dependable and consistent player who if unspectacular still had his fair share of admirers for his professionalism and reliability. The only aspect of Mark Reid&#39;s game that was lacking was a turn of pace.<br><br>However when <a href="/page/Hay%2C+David" target="_self">Davie Hay</a> replaced Billy McNeill as Celtic boss in the summer of <a href="/page/1983" target="_self">1983</a>, Mark Reid found himself no longer an automatic choice for the left-back berth and even when playing well he would find himself regularly consigned to the bench. Brian Whittaker arrived from Partick Thistle in August and Mark Reid, Whittaker and Graeme Sinclair fought it out for the left back role.<br><br>In March 1984, Mark Reid showed commendable coolness in scoring two important penalties. In the second leg of the League Cup semi final at Parkhead against a strong Aberdeen side, he fired home the winning goal from the spot after a considerable delay, to take Celtic to the final. A fortnight later against Rangers in the final at Hampden, Celtic were 2-1 down in injury time when they were awarded a penalty for a foul on Murdo MacLeod. Mark Reid stepped forward again to coolly score although Celts would ultimately lose 3-2 in extra time.<br><br>In April <a href="/page/1985" target="_self">1985</a> Charlton made a bid to take the player to London and Mark Reid, not satisfied with being in and out of the team, decided to make the move in search of regular first team football for a fee of &pound;50,000. By the time he had left for England, Reid had made 177 appearances for Celtic and netted 12 goals. He was still young, only 23 and maybe could have held on at Celtic, however as he was to later comment:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;Obviously I have regrets. I would rather have still been there and been able to play an important part but I think I realised that it was time to move on and complete another chapter&quot;.<br></i></blockquote><br>He had achieved a lot at Celtic, and a long career, winning three league titles in a very competitive time in Scottish football with both Aberdeen &amp; Dundee Utd going through a golden era both domestically &amp; in Europe.<br><br>He had a long career with Charlton, making around 200 appearances before moving over to St Mirren where he wrapped up his career in 1993 after various injuries curtailed his form.<br><br>Mark Reid subsequently carved out a career as a Driving Instructor when he retired from football.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none  WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career </h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br>(subs)<br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1977-85</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  120 (4)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  17</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  21 (2)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  12 (1)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  170 (7)</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  5</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  6</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  12</td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <div align="center">  ( ) = Substitute Appearance</div>  <h3 align="left">  </h3>  <h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><div><b>Scottish League</b></div><div><ul><li><font color="#333333"><a href="/page/1979" target="_self"><font size="2">1978-79</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1981" target="_self"><font size="2">1980-81</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1982" target="_self"><font size="2">1981-82</font></a></font></li></ul></div><div><b>Scottish Cup</b></div><div><ul><li><font size="2"> <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1984-85" target="_self">1985</a></font></li></ul></div><div><b>Scottish League Cup</b></div><div><ul><li><font size="2"> <a href="/page/1983" target="_self">1982-83</a></font></li></ul></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3><h3>  </h3>  <ul>  <li>  <font color="#333333"><a href="/page/Reid%2C+Mark+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></font></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>Where are they now?

For it was then that he made nearly 200  appearances for the club, winning several trophies including two league  championships in an exciting and talented Hoops side.<br><br>However,  with his first-team chances becoming more limited, the full-back elected  to leave and join Charlton Athletic. As someone who had spent his  entire career in Paradise, emerging from the club&rsquo;s youth set-up, this  was a difficult decision but one which he would ultimately reap the  rewards from.<br><br>Reid helped the London side reach the old First  Division and he got the opportunity to face some of the top teams and  players in England of that era, staying there for six years before  returning to Scotland in 1991.<br><br>After an injury-plagued two  seasons with St Mirren, he decided to call time on his playing days and  he has since carved out a successful career as a driving instructor,  something he thoroughly enjoys.<br><br><i>You were  one of several talented youngsters in the club&rsquo;s youth system who broke  into to the top-team. Was it an exciting time to be a young player at  Celtic? </i><br>I came up with a trial with Celtic Boys&rsquo; Club  Under-14s and at that point Charlie Nicholas was there and then at U16  Danny Crainie and Willie McStay came so there was quite a few of us that  got pushed through to the reserves after that.<br><br><i>Did  it make it easier when you went into the first-team, having so many of  your team-mates from the youth team and reserves there already?</i><br>That  was a big plus. Charlie had been first to get into the team. Everybody  else was just hoping they would get a break. Obviously the breaks come  when you least expect them. When the team is not doing well that&rsquo;s when  you are going to get a chance, which was unfortunate for some other  people.<br><br><i>You made your full debut against Dundee United at Tannadice. What are your memories of that game?</i><br>It  was the League Cup semi-final at Tannadice and I think we drew 1-1. I  just remember it was a great atmosphere. There was a big crowd that  night and Dundee United were a good side. It was Paul Sturrock I was  against that night. It was a great experience for me. We played against  Airdrie at Broomfield on the Saturday and we won 4-1.<br>  <br><i>Obviously you had captained the reserve side for a while. Were your nervous when you heard you were playing?</i><br>I  was actually playing midfield for a lot of games but in bounce games I  ended up playing at left-back and did reasonably well against Davie  Provan when the first team played the second team. They had lost a few  games before that and I think myself, John Weir and John Halpin were  called into the squad. I think John Weir and myself played that night  and John Halpin was a sub. I would have had a bit of nerves. It&rsquo;s only  natural to be like that and I don&rsquo;t think it does any harm to be a bit  nervous so long as it isn&rsquo;t too much.<br><br><i>After that you  began to become a regular fixture in the first team. When did you feel  you were an established senior member of the side?</i><br>I  never took it for granted that I was going to be an established player. I  stayed in the team the whole season and we won the league so obviously I  got a lot of confidence from that, and the following season was a great  season as well when we won the league two years on the trot. They were  probably my best spells for the club. We lost the league the next year. I  think we were in front of Dundee Utd by 10 points at one stage and then  they drew it back, so the season after that I was in and out of the  side and then working my way back in at times.<br><br><i>And  you also became one of the recognised penalty takers for the team,  scoring some crucial ones along the way. Did you always feel confident  taking them?</i><br>It was just something I had done. I had  won a penalty kick competition when I was 15 and won a trip to the  Olympics so it was just something I had done at school and all the way  through the reserves. It had never fazed me.<br><br><i>You scored some important ones, particularly in the cup competitions, but is there one that stands out?</i><br>The  semi-final was one I like to remember as it was a great game and we got  through against Aberdeen. I think it was the second leg at Celtic Park  and we beat them 1-0 and I have about two or three great pictures of  it. Whoever took the picture took about three or four as it went in. So,  they were great momentoes for me.<br><br><i>Who did you have a good understanding with on the left-hand side in that Celtic team? </i><br>Probably  Murdo MacLeod was a more defensive-minded player. Although he was an  attacking midfielder, he did his defensive duties, so as a result he was  always in closer contact. Whereas Tommy Burns was more of a free  spirit, a great player but maybe didn&rsquo;t help me as much from a defensive  point of view, but his attacking qualities were great.<br><br><i>When  Davie Hay took over, a number of players arrived in the full-back  positions. Was it difficult dealing with all this extra competition?</i><br>Graeme  Sinclair was one that arrived and he played in a lot of positions and  then Brian Whittaker arrived. Obviously I had a feeling that my days  might be numbered but I worked myself back in. I had great belief in  myself. I think it was the UEFA Cup games that I came back in, and I  eventually got my position back.<br><br><i>Do you have a favourite game from your Celtic career? </i><br>My  Glasgow derby debut. It would have been around November 1980 and I  think it was snowing. And I&rsquo;m trying to picture if Willie Johnston was  playing. Derek Johnstone was up front, Colin Jackson and Bobby Russell  were also playing for Rangers, so a lot of big players at that point. We  had a good side and I remember the atmosphere was just great, and to  win was the highlight of my life at that point. It was at Celtic Park.<br><br><i>Who were you close to in that Celtic dressing room?</i><br>Graeme  Sinclair was a great friend, John Halpin, Willie McStay, Danny Crainie  and Charlie &ndash; the younger element although I got on really well with the  older players.<br><br><i>Why did you eventually decide to leave Celtic?</i><br>I  was out of the team at the point. It was clear that I wasn&rsquo;t going to  have a long-term future at the club. I realised that and heard that  Charlton wanted to come up and watch me. They were in the old Second  Division at that point and they wanted me to sign. The gamble at that  point was that they still could have still been relegated to the Third  Division. Jimmy Hill was their chairman at that point and there were  plans to buy about six or seven players. We stayed up and the  transformation the following season was unbelievable. We got promoted to  the First Division which is the Premier League now.<br><br><i>What kind of players were you playing alongside in that Charlton team?</i><br>Robert  Lee, who went on to play for Newcastle United, was there as was Mike  Flannigan, a big player, who played at Queens Park Rangers. There were a  lot of good professionals there. We gelled well into a team &ndash; we really  did.<br><br><i>What was it like moving from Celtic, a huge fish in a small pond, to Charlton?</i><br>It  was different ends of the scale. It was completely different. But in  many ways I think it helped me as I went from an environment where I  wasn&rsquo;t in the team to somewhere where they really valued me and I was an  important member of the team. It gave me a lot of confidence and I  think my performances upped a bit there. The difference was that you  could beat and it was very disappointing and there would be an inquest  but it wouldn&rsquo;t be the end of the world but at Celtic, the highs would  be great but the lows would not be so good &ndash; and there could be lows. I  think a lot of people forget that. You could have a loss of form, be  injured or the crowd could be on your back but the highs more than  compensated for that.<br><br><i>You experienced several seasons in England&rsquo;s top flight but who did you enjoy facing on the pitch?</i><br>I  played at all the grounds &ndash; Manchester United, Everton, Arsenal,  Chelsea. I played against Gordon Strachan at Man Utd. I had some great  games. I played against Liverpool when they were managed by Dalglish and  had Rush, Beardsley and Barnes.<br><br><i>Who was your toughest opponent in English football?</i><br>It  would probably be Franz Carr at Nottingham Forrest because he was like a  whippet. He hugged the line and they had a big pitch so when the ball  was transferred to that side &ndash; my God, he could move!<br><br><i>Did you have any regrets about leaving Celtic?</i><br>Obviously  I have regrets. I would rather have still been there and been able to  play an important part but I think I realised that it was time to move  on and complete another chapter.<br><br><i>After staying with Charlton for a number of years, you eventually returned back to Scotland and had a spell with St Mirren?</i><br>I  came up to St Mirren when Davie Hay was the manager but I got injured  early on and never did myself any justice. I kept trying to come back  when my knee wasn&rsquo;t right to try and justify myself and it backfired on  me as I ended up having three operations.<br><br><i>So did it get to the stage where you felt it was time to call time on your career?</i><br>After  the two-year contract, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t carry on. I don&rsquo;t think I did  myself justice at the club. We had a young physio at the time and I  don&rsquo;t think he was strong enough to say you can&rsquo;t play. I trained and my  knee was like a balloon a lot of the time.<br><br><i>After calling time in your career in 1993, did you have any idea what you wanted to do after football?</i><br>No.  I went into a newsagents with Graeme Sinclair which didn&rsquo;t work out for  me. It just wasn&rsquo;t for me. The early rises just weren&rsquo;t for me, getting  papers and all that. So it never worked out. But it was nothing to do  with Graeme. It was just me. I couldn&rsquo;t do it.<br><br><i>You are now a driving instructor &ndash; how long have you been doing that for?</i><br>I  have been doing this for 17 years. I left the newsagents and didn&rsquo;t  have anything and it was quite a concern but my neighbour was a driving  instructor and she said why don&rsquo;t you try it? I got all the information  and got great help from the PFA in Scotland and England who paid for my  training, and I would encourage any young player now to get some sort of  career behind them while they are playing so when they stop they have  something they can do, rather than panicking at the end of it and  wondering what they are going to do.<br><br><i>Do you get satisfaction from helping people pass their test?</i><br>I  do enjoy it. My neighbour took me on her books for six months and I  left with about five customers, so it was terrible to start with but I  built it up and it&rsquo;s still going to this day. I think it&rsquo;s enjoyable as  you have people who struggle but eventually get through it. It&rsquo;s a great  achievement for people to get through it. I think the St Mirren thing  made it a smoother transition for me. I was glad to finish and the  relieved about finishing. Once that decision was made I was happy about  that.<br><br><i>When you look back on your Celtic career, are you proud of what you achieved?</i><br>I  am really proud. I was there at 14 years of age to 23. Jock Stein was  there when I was an S-form. Sean Fallon and Davie McParland were there. I  met Jimmy Johnstone, who came into training and was great with all the  young boys. It&rsquo;s a great achievement. My son and my two daughters are  extremely proud as well as they will meet people who will say, &lsquo;Your Dad  played for Celtic&rsquo;. My son is working up in Aberdeen now and he has met  quite a few of Celtic supporters who are older than him, who knew that I  had played, and he has been able to make quite a few friends because of  it.<br><br></div></div>
