Timo Weah  himself was born in the US and represented the land of his birth, but  was playing now for his father&#39;s old club in France, PSG. His club were  heavily bloated financially with many world class players like Neymar,  Cavani and Mbappe, so the young Timo Weah was sent out on loan to Celtic  to gain some experience.</div><div><br>Celtic were eager to  appease the fans&#39; concerns after a recent defeat to Sevco that  unexpectedly put the league race back on, and Timo Weah seemed like an  interesting choice. It also started up a wave of puns on his name (&#39;<i>Show me the Weah to go home</i>&#39;, &#39;<i>Weah are sailing</i>&#39; etc).</div><div><br>One  thing was clear, he had been trained heavily for years by PR &amp; spin  doctors, as with his strong American accent, he was the most polished  speaker you can ever listen to at a post-match player interview.</div>   Interesting challenge in 2019, whether it was Sevco or Celtic who had  brought in the better loan players. Celtic had Weah &amp; Burke, who  were young, whilst Sevco had brought in expensive loan signings Davis  &amp; Jermaine Dafoe.<br><br>Timo Weah had a great start coming on as a  sub v Airdrie in Jan 2019 in a Scottish Cup match for his debut, and  helped showed his skills to all. He proved it again soon after by coming  on the pitch with only around 15mins left v St Johnstone in Feb 2019  with a man of the match performance to set up a goal and score in a 2-0  victory. It was Superbowl Sunday on the same day so quite fitting, but  Timo Weah was the only American footballer the Celtic support were  interested in.<br><br>It was clear from his games that he was a burst of  positivity at a junction of the season when Celtic needed it the most,  as despite Celtic being just in front in the league race, Sevco had some  momentum being boosted by a victory over Celtic in Dec 2018 and key  loan signings in January 2019. Timo Weah and Burke though were to be a  big understated difference.<br><br>His mother (the First Lady of Liberia  (i.e. President&#39;s wife)) even turned up to watch her son v Kilmarnock  at Rugby Park in an incredible late win, 1-0 90th minute winner, in Feb  2019. Quite a feat, and interesting to know her reaction after seeing  her son being yellow carded straight after the final whistle for an  altercation. It was to be one of his most celebrated moments after that  heated 1-0 victory v  in-form Kilmarnock, when he ended up in a  confrontation with  opposition players angry with him trying to stir him  up. He stood his  ground and all were impressed. <br><br>Back at his  parent club, PSG had been humiliatingly knocked out  by Man  Utd in the  Round of 16 in the European Cup despite a 2-0 away  first leg  lead in  March 2019. This was a time when Man Utd were the poor  relations  amongst the big guns in the English Premiership, finishing  sixth in  their league. So going back to PSG was going to be a big  situation,  especially after reports that their owners were looking to  reduce their  previous profligate spending plans.<br><br>In time Celtic, went on to  win the league as Sevco imploded, but it can be argued both ways the  difference that Timo Weah made. Granted he was mostly used from off the  bench, but in total he scored just four goals in his spell. Celtic only  lost in one match he played in, a 2-0 defeat at home in the UEFA Cup to  Valencia, and his performances were mostly adequate. You could see the  effort, and you could see the talent which paid off on occasion, but  once settled in, he had still a lot to develop in.<br><br>Once Lennon  came in as interim manager after Brendan Rodgers left abruptly, Timo  Weah was more out of the picture. His performances seemed to tail off,  and despite a general popularity amongst the support, he was rarely  called upon by the manager for matches. He didn&#39;t even get to play  against Sevco in his short spell at Celtic.<br><br><div>However, Timo  Weah was beginning to seem to be surplus to requirements, and reports  were that he &amp; Lennon had an issue. He was young and developing, but  he did prove it hard to show that he could hold down a starting  position despite his excellent start. </div><div><br>He was  to leave Celtic prematurely, when he was put on the spot in a situation  he couldn&#39;t win. Celtic were heading for the treble-treble, having won  the league and Sevco to face on the Sunday coming in the league and  Hearts in the Scottish Cup final a few weeks later. However, the USA was  to play in the U20 World Cup which would clash with the Scottish Cup  final, and as there was no reasonable resolution Timo Weah had a choice.  He picked the national side, but Lennon decided best then he just move  on early. <br><br>A sorry way for the popular Timo Weah to leave Celtic.  Would have been good for him to have the chance to lift the league  trophy with the players and then play in the Scottish Cup final. Timo  Weah spoilt it in part with what was mostly a fine going away message,  but added what seemed to be a dig at Lennon which was uncalled for and  best left behind closed doors. Timo Weah could have tried to buckle down  more and prove himself, but it was local boy Ryan Christie who was the  young standout star at Celtic, and not Timo Weah despite the familial  heritage.</div><br>Some were to use this as an example of Lennon&#39;s at  time poor man management, but there are two sides to every story. His  last few appearances at Celtic showed a mostly out of sorts Weah, which  didn&#39;t bode well.<br><br>He had shown that he was a rough diamond with  the talent to prove himself and make a name for himself. He was still  developing, but the loan out system could be double edged, and many  other young players from the mega clubs had seen their careers killed  stone dead by the loan system (e.g. Islam Feruz). We really wished it  wouldn&#39;t be the case with him. <br><br>We wished him the best.<br><br><div><b>Post-Celtic</b></div><div>On  return to PSG, he was put on the transfer list immediately and sold to  Lille, which was good news as got him off the potentially ruinous  repeat-loan out system.<br><br>[...]</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes</h3><div>&quot;My  father&#39;s considered one of the best strikers that have ever played  the  game.

The sample size for the   forward is, admittedly, small. He has played only 143 minutes spread   over three matches, all in August, but has left little doubt what he is   capable of. <br>Since, he has been reduced to training with the first   team, a trio of outings for PSG&rsquo;s &lsquo;B&rsquo; team, with whom he has netted   twice in the regionalised French fourth tier, and five international   games. <br>Weah&rsquo;s lack of playing time at the Parc des Princes is no   slight on his ability, however. As well as Neymar and Mbappe, he faces   competition from Edinson Cavani for the No.9 role in what is a   star-studded squad. <br>Celtic have already seen at close quarters what   he is capable of. When the sides met in Dumbarton in a UEFA Youth  League  fixture last term, it was Weah who got the winner as PSG edged  the  match 3-2. <br>At 18, his lack of experience comes in stark  contrast to  Rangers signing Defoe, who is exactly twice his age. And  while the  Englishman joins the Ibrox club with little to prove as he  enters the  final years of his career, for New York-born Weah, the next  stage of his  professional life is set to be pivotal. <br>He is used to  scrutiny,  though, having seen his young career develop in something of a  goldfish  bowl due to his father, George, being the greatest African  footballer  ever and still the only player from the continent to have  won the Ballon  d&rsquo;Or. <br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the name on my back,&rdquo; he said this summer. <br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fans who see it, so there&rsquo;s no pressure.&rdquo; <br>Despite   his illustrious dad, it is not necessarily to the current President of   Liberia he turns to for advice. Instead, it is his Jamaican mother  Clar  who has been the dominant influence on his football, having first  taught  him the basics of the game and now acts as an advisor. <br>&ldquo;She knows a lot because she watched my dad,&rdquo; Tim explained as a 15-year-old. <br>Indeed,   it was Clar who persuaded her son to remain in Paris for the first  half  of the season rather than seek a more immediate loan move away. <br>&ldquo;My   mum, she thought I am still really young and tender. There&rsquo;s still  some  stuff to work on,&rdquo; he said in September. &ldquo;She thought if I went to  a  lesser team, there would be so many expectations to carry that team  or  potentially fight for a league winning spot. I don&rsquo;t feel that I&rsquo;m  ready  for that.&rdquo; <br>At Celtic, he is unlikely to have to carry such a  burden  alone. Odsonne Edouard, another PSG youth product, will offer   competition such that Weah is not unduly relied upon, while the volume   of fixtures that they face in the early months of 2019 guarantees him   the game time that he and his parent club crave. <br>Edouard, who never   managed a first-team appearance in Paris and scored only one Ligue 1   goal in nearly 10 hours of pitch time during a loan spell with Toulouse,   offers a useful comparison for what manager Brendan Rodgers can expect   from the teenager. <br>There are similarities in the style of the pair, which is perhaps inevitable given they came through the same academy. <br>Edouard,   however, is the more natural centre forward, given that he is more   physically developed and is more comfortable playing with his back to   goal. <br>Weah, on the other hand, is quicker than the 20-year-old, has   shown the technical capacity and poise of his father when it comes to   drifting away from opponents, but typically moves into wider areas,   creating spaces for the midfield to attack. Although wiry, he is   stronger than he appears and when taking the ball into feet with his   back to goal prefers to offload with one touch rather than holding it   into his body. <br>No doubt he has the tools to establish himself at the   highest level, but potential is one thing, exploiting it another   entirely. <br>His arrival at Celtic Park therefore represents a   different kind of risk than the one Rangers are taking with Defoe, a   player with a history to support the expectation placed upon him south   of the Clyde. <br>In the East End, meanwhile, Celtic are set to get   their hands on a youngster largely untested in the senior game but who   could have the world at his feet should everything go according to plan.   <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><img align="bottom" alt="Weah, Timothy - The Celtic Wiki" height="787" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/6c6acbbdcbbdb3de49723a177cb7afbd/GW643H787" title="Weah, Timothy - The Celtic Wiki" width="643"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Weah, Timothy - The Celtic Wiki" height="712" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/f3d8170aea89e7e0e92670646492b94c/GW485H712" title="Weah, Timothy - The Celtic Wiki" width="485"><br><br>  <br><h3>Celtic boss Neil Lennon gives loan ace Timo Weah boot after Scottish Cup final snub</h3><br>ALISON McCONNELL<br>Published: 22:59 Friday 10 May 2019<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic/celtic-boss-neil-lennon-gives-loan-ace-timo-weah-boot-after-scottish-cup-final-snub-1-4925347<br>Timothy Weah was asked to leave Celtic yesterday afternoon because he refused to play in the Scottish Cup final against Hearts.<br><br>The  19-year-old&rsquo;s loan from Paris Saint-Germain was cut short yesterday  afternoon, with the striker laying the blame for his premature exit at  Neil Lennon as he left the club. Weah used social media platform  Instagram to say: &ldquo;I will be joining my national team to participate in  the U20 World Cup in Poland. With this decision, the gaffer told me it  is in the best interests of the team that I collect my things and go  home rather than be a part of the game on Sunday so I&rsquo;ll be on my way.&rdquo;<br><br>It  is understood, however, that the player was offered the opportunity to  play for Celtic in Scottish Cup final at Hampden on 25 May and then  rejoin his international colleagues in Poland for the remainder of their  World Cup campaign.<br><br>The USA had invited Weah to head to a  training camp after this weekend&rsquo;s game against Rangers at Ibrox to  start preparations for the World Cup but Tab Ramos, the under-20  manager, was prepared to allow Weah to then return to Lennoxtown the  week before the cup final.<br><br>The understanding was that Weah would  then have ample time with his Celtic colleagues to prepare for the  club&rsquo;s bid to secure a historic treble treble.<br><br>The compromise  agreed with the club and the USA coaching staff was that Weah would miss  their opening game against Ukraine but would return to Poland  immediately after the Hampden game against Hearts.<br><br>That would  have given Weah the remainder of the World Cup campaign with America&rsquo;s  next games on Monday 27 May against Nigeria and Qatar on Thursday 30  May.<br><br>It was Weah himself who refused to return to Glasgow for the  final game of the season. Caretaker Celtic manager Lennon interpreted  that decision as a lack of commitment from the player and felt it best  for all parties that he leave the squad.<br><br>&ldquo;I still have a lot of  growing up to do in my game,&rdquo; said Weah. &ldquo;I am especially thankful to  the Celtic family for giving me the opportunity to show you all what I  am capable of doing once given the chance. I want to thank my team-mates  for supporting me every step of the way. Thanks so much to Celtic FC  and to you the fans for accepting me.&rdquo;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br></div></div>
