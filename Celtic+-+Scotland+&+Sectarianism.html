(Now  wasteland).<br><br>The original Rangers growth came as a response to  Celtic and yes it would have been Queens Park if they had taken up  professionalism when it was introduced in 1893.  <br><br>At our birth when all clubs in Scotland were amatuer, Queens Park were the biggest club in Scotland. <br><br>Rangers  had been going 15 years, had won 2 or 3 cups, nearly went bust in 1888  and were saved by a bail out and weren&#39;t even invited to play in the  Glasgow Cup as they weren&#39;t in the top four clubs in Glasgow. They were  nomadic and hadn&#39;t even settled into the first Ibrox and oh yes, they  had only got round to playing one Catholic in their 15 years of  existance and even that was a loan for one game in a friendly, a certain  Neil McCallum.<br><br>Without Celtic&#39;s birth in 1887, Rangers would be a provincial club, if they ever saw out the 1880s at all.<br><br>Anyone  who comes up with the following seriously needs their head examined,  &quot;&quot;The real origins of sectarianism in Scottish football lay in the very  formation of the Celtic football club and their unprecedented success&quot;.<br><br>Add  to that &quot;(Rangers) were Protestant only in the sense that the vast  majority of clubs in Scotland at that time were made up of Protestants&quot;.<br><br>In  reality Rangers were exclusively Protestant for 15 years, during this  time there were Catholic players in the game in many Irish Catholic  teams as well as for example Madden at Dumbarton, McCallum and Kelly at  Renton, the two Maleys who had played at 3rd Lanark, amongst the best  players in the land at the time but Rangers avoided every one of them.<br><br>Wonder why?<br><br>Hibernian  were formed unashamedly as an Irish Catholic club in 1875 and it&#39;s said  they only signed Catholics until they went bust and were reformed the  next year in the early 1890s near their original ground. A letter to a  newspaper in the 1880s denies Hibs only signing Catholics and went as  far as to name a number of Hibs players who were non Catholic. This  needs further examination of the facts.<br><br>Although much is made of  our open policy since the start, its not quite true and Willie Maley  mentions it briefly in his book in 1938. <br>In fact our first non Catholic signing was in 1890. <br><br>It&#39;s asserted that &quot;the Celtic Board rejected an attempt to restrict the number of non Catholics in the team to three&quot;.<br>Again it&#39;s a good story but i&#39;ve never seen any proof to back this up. <br><br>In  the real world, Scottish football was sectarian well before Celtic were  thought of. Communities tended to stick together even more tightly in  those days and the numerous Irish Catholic teams were formed to give  their own communities a chance to play the game as they were often  overlooked.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s arrival transformed the scene almost overnight. <br><br>We led the call for the League to be introduced in 1890 and for professionalism to follow in 1893.  <br><br>We raised the bar significantly and blew away the cobwebs from the Scottish game which was run by old fogies.<br><br>The  drive and determination of our Founding Fathers not only brought us  success but challenged the rest of Scottish football to hang onto our  coat tails.   <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Interesting take on Celtic/Rangers by American author Franklin Foer. </h3>This author deals with the &#39;Pornography of Sects&#39;!<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Celtic - Scotland & Sectarianism" height="911" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/eJQxL6U7DY1P2kseJliXMg195170/GW600H911" title="Celtic - Scotland & Sectarianism" width="600"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Celtic - Scotland & Sectarianism" height="845" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/UYevJLY7XMAxn-ny9HXDBA154991/GW600H845" title="Celtic - Scotland & Sectarianism" width="600"><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>  MoJo Rising: Maurice Johnston 30 Years On</h3>https://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2019/07/09/mojo-rising-maurice-johnston-30-years-on/<br>MOJO  RISIN&rsquo;: 30 years on, Rangers&rsquo; signing of Maurice Johnston proved a  missed opportunity in the fight against sectarianism in Scottish  football.<br><br>It was July 1989, exactly thirty years ago this week,  when Graeme Souness&rsquo;s Rangers stunned the world of Scottish football by  signing the striker Maurice Johnston from under the noses of the Glasgow  club&rsquo;s perennial rivals Celtic. Johnston had previously spent three  seasons on the green side of the city, scoring fifty goals in a hundred  appearances for the team he had grown up supporting, but he had passed  the last two years in relative anonymity with the French club Nantes,  where he had fled in 1987 to escape the press intrusion and sectarian  abuse which he had been subjected to after a number of high profile  incidents during his playing days at Parkhead. On 10 July 1989 however,  the Scottish game collectively fell off its chair in astonishment, as a  sheepish looking Johnston, flanked by his new manager, was ushered into  the Blue Room at Ibrox Park and presented to the media as free-spending  Rangers&rsquo; latest acquisition.<br><br>The signing was remarkable because  Johnston was from a Roman Catholic background and, ever since the days  of the Edwardian era at the turn of the 20th century, Rangers had been  operating an exclusionary employment policy which prevented them from  signing players from that section of the community. For most of the next  sixty years, Rangers&rsquo; policy went largely uncommented upon in polite  society. The religious divide in Glasgow, between Catholic Celtic and  Protestant Rangers, was allowed to fester and deepen over decades of  increasingly bitter and trenchant rivalry, with the matter effectively  becoming a taboo subject and criticism of the Ibrox club&rsquo;s stance in the  press or in the wider society was almost unheard of. One or two  individuals did manage to slip through the net however; in the 1950s the  South African striker Don Kichenbrand had a short, largely unproductive  spell at Ibrox. Known as &lsquo;the Rhino&rsquo; and lambasted for a series of  outrageous misses in front of goal, Kichenbrand went to extraordinary  lengths to disguise his Catholic upbringing and fit in with his new  team, even confirming his induction into the Ibrox faction by joining a  Lanarkshire Masonic lodge. His secret remained safe until the day after  Johnston&rsquo;s transfer to Rangers more than thirty years later, when the  Daily Record, having missed out on the scoop of the century after  Souness confirmed the story of the signing to his favourite newspaper  The Sun, carried an interview with Kichenbrand. In the article, the  former striker admitted: &ldquo;My teammates and bosses at the club just  assumed that I had been vetted before I was signed. Every player was.&rdquo;  In fact Rangers&rsquo; South African scout, Charlie Watkins, had forgotten to  look into the player&rsquo;s background and only remembered to ask the  pertinent question as the pair were waiting at the airport before  boarding the flight from Johannesburg, as Kichenbrand remembered:  &ldquo;Charlie Watkins, the man who had convinced Glasgow Rangers that they  should sign me, suddenly said, &lsquo;By the way, you&rsquo;re not Catholic, are  you?&rsquo; When I told him &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; he nearly collapsed. Then he growled, &lsquo;Do  not mention that again &ndash; to anyone!&rsquo; I never did.&rdquo;<br><br>Other than  the odd aberration, Rangers blazed a trail as the unblemished bastion of  Protestant superiority in Scotland. Revelling in their role as the  establishment club and the foremost Protestant sporting institution in  the land, Rangers ruled the roost in Scottish football for decades,  dominating the domestic game under managers William Wilton (1899 &ndash;  1920), Bill Struth (1920 &ndash; 1954) and Scot Symon (1954 &ndash; 1967). By the  late 1960s however, isolated murmurings of disapproval and occasionally  even outright criticism of Rangers&rsquo; stance had begun to appear in the  popular press and elsewhere, usually in association with rioting fans in  Birmingham, Manchester, Barcelona and various other locations. After  the club&rsquo;s defeat to Newcastle United in the semi-final of the Inter  Cities Fairs Cup in 1969, former player Willie Waddell, then working as a  journalist with the Scottish Daily Express, condemned the scenes of  violence at St James&rsquo; Park after Rangers fans invaded the field when the  Tynesiders scored a second, decisive goal in the tie. &ldquo;I felt like  crawling stealthily back over the border under cover of darkness,  stunned and shocked that I had been connected with this club and its  fans for more than thirty years,&rdquo; Waddell lamented. Curiously, however,  once he was installed as Rangers manager later in the year, and  subsequently as general manager in 1972, Waddell instead took the view  that the club&rsquo;s internal affairs were its own business and nobody  else&rsquo;s, and he refused to correlate the twin issues which were blighting  Rangers at the time, namely hooliganism and bigotry, as being in any  way linked.<br><br>Eventually, however, in response to a UK- wide wave  of indignation in the 1970s over hooliganism and Rangers&rsquo; no-Catholics  stance, general manager Waddell announced in 1976, &lsquo;We are determined to  end Rangers&rsquo; image as a sectarian club&hellip; no religious barriers will be  put up by this club regarding the signing of players.&rsquo; It was one of the  first public references to a &lsquo;sectarian&rsquo; agenda at Ibrox and there was  widespread jubilation and hope amongst the wider community that Rangers  might eventually, in the not too distant future, sign a Catholic  football player. But as the years went by and no Catholic player  appeared in the light blue, perhaps as a result of the lack of  leadership and continued in-fighting in the club&rsquo;s boardroom, these  hopes were dashed. In his book Glasgow&rsquo;s Giants, historian Bill Murray  seemed to hit the nail on the head when he observed of Rangers&rsquo;  habitually empty promises, &lsquo;To the media and the public at large these  statements were taken with large spoonfuls of scepticism. They had heard  it all before: they were a necessary disclaimer to keep any  investigators from FIFA at bay. A sop to the media and a wink to their  fans who knew that everything would continue to be as it should be at  Ibrox.&rsquo;<br><br>During the 1980s, tales continued to abound about  players at Ibrox even being ushered towards the exit door if they  happened to fall in love with and marry Catholic girls. One such player  was forward Graham Fyfe, who claimed that, despite his wife effectively  renouncing her faith and their marriage taking place in the Church of  Scotland, he nevertheless felt the need to leave Ibrox in 1980, after  being questioned by the club&rsquo;s management about his wedding arrangements  and his private life in general. Fyfe&rsquo;s allegation was contested by  other players at the time who had also married Catholic women, such as  Bobby Russell and Derek Johnstone, both of whom remained at the club  into the new decade, and by 1982, striker Gordon Dalziel felt  comfortable enough to announce publicly his engagement to a Catholic  girl, telling the press, &lsquo;I have already had the all-clear at Ibrox. It  will not make any difference. I&rsquo;m not going to get married in the chapel  or anything like that.&rsquo; Manager John Greig added to the general tone of  reassurance, informing the media, &lsquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who he is  marrying. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me and it doesn&rsquo;t matter to Rangers.  Bobby Russell&rsquo;s been married to a Catholic for years. Gordon Dalziel has  a right to marry who he wants.&rsquo;<br><br>Despite such worthy assurances  however, the Church of Scotland decided to intervene in the situation at  Ibrox in 1980, after the violent scenes witnessed around the world  following Celtic&rsquo;s 1 &ndash; 0 victory over Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final.  The Kirk&rsquo;s General Assembly proposed a motion calling on Rangers to end  their exclusionary employment practices and publicly distance  themselves from such discrimination, which was passed by a majority of  200. But of the 1250 commissioners, 400 had abstained, so the result was  seen as ambiguous and the expected impact failed to materialise.  Nevertheless the Church&rsquo;s General Assembly report of the same year  noted, &lsquo;Tensions would be eased if all clubs, and Rangers FC in  particular, would publicly disclaim sectarian bias in management and  team structure, and through integrated team selection, publicly prove  that sectarianism has no place in Scottish sport.&rsquo;<br><br>By now it  seemed clear that the growing controversy surrounding Rangers&rsquo;  exclusionary employment policy was not going to go away. Despite these  calls from the Church and elsewhere however, when Jock Wallace was  reappointed Rangers manager in November 1983, he seemed less than taken  with the ambivalent promises to end the club&rsquo;s arcane practices. On the  day of his appointment, Wallace emerged from the stadium onto Copland  Road and told the waiting media, &lsquo;I have been told by the board that I  have complete control over who I select, and I will sign players on  ability. Religion will not come into it.&rsquo; He then turned on his heels  and departed without taking further questions.<br><br>Wallace, it  seemed, having returned to his &lsquo;dream job&rsquo;, was living out his schoolboy  fantasy as manager of his favourite team, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve always been a Rangers  fan,&rsquo; he announced after the first game of his second spell in charge at  Ibrox, a 3 &ndash; 0 defeat to Aberdeen at Pittodrie, &lsquo;Ever since I was a lad  of nine and they came through to play near my home on the east coast.  The team that made me a Rangers fan for life still trips off the tongue:  Brown, Young, Shaw, McColl, Woodburn, Cox, Waddell, Gillick, Thornton,  Duncanson and Caskie,&rdquo; he rattled off Bill Struth&rsquo;s team from the  immediate post-war period. On that first trip up to Pittodrie, Wallace  invited his agent Bill McMurdo, whom he had dubbed &lsquo;Agent Orange&rsquo;  because of his Rangers allegiances and his political views, onto the  team bus. A founder member of the Scottish Unionist Party and an  acknowledged Orangeman and Freemason, McMurdo had turned his Uddingston  home into a Rangers shrine, naming it &lsquo;Ibrox&rsquo; and decking it out in the  club&rsquo;s colours of red, white and blue.<br><br>On the journey north,  McMurdo provided Wallace with a cassette so that he could play Rangers  songs over the speaker system and the manager encouraged his players to  join in the singing of &lsquo;No Surrender&rsquo;. McMurdo later confided, &lsquo;Jock  acted as compere and&hellip; those who didn&rsquo;t know the words were urged to  learn them for the next away game. [Ulsterman] Jimmy Nicholl knew the  words inside out and Jock said to him, &ldquo;Brilliant Jimmy, you know all  the words, you&rsquo;re the captain today!&rdquo;&rsquo; It&rsquo;s an apocryphal story; Nicholl  had only just arrived at the club, having been signed by John Greig in  his final days in charge at Ibrox, and the Irishman didn&rsquo;t in fact  captain the side that day. But nevertheless, it&rsquo;s easy to see how a  Catholic player might have struggled to flourish in such an environment  and, needless to say, by the time Wallace was sacked in April 1986,  there was still scant sign of a Catholic football player at Rangers,  with only youngster John Spencer having made a handful of first team  appearances for the club.<br><br>Wallace&rsquo;s replacement as team manager,  in the wake of a boardroom coup at Ibrox which had cleared out a cabal  of old guard custodian-directors, was the former Liverpool and Scotland  midfielder Graeme Souness. Immediately on his appointment, Souness was  quizzed about the signing policy, &lsquo;I was asked the question the very  first day I went to Rangers, would you sign a Catholic?&rsquo; He later  recalled. &lsquo;And my answer then was quite simple. I said, look, my wife is  a Catholic, I&rsquo;ve got two kids who&rsquo;ve been christened Catholic, so  you&rsquo;re saying to me I can&rsquo;t come to work with a Catholic, but I can go  home to a Catholic? I said of course I would sign a Catholic.&rsquo; Once  again, hope sprang eternal that this more genuine sounding claim would  lead to the longed for breakthrough.<br><br>Souness seemed determined  to end the policy and privately, behind the scenes, he was making  enquiries about the potential impact of such a signing, almost from the  moment he arrived. The sheer iconoclasm of the idea appealed to  Souness&rsquo;s maverick personality and, as well as the backing of the new  Rangers board, Souness also found that there was tentative support from  the wider community for the potentially seminal change, with one young  Rangers supporting journalist telling the new manager that he thought  such a signing would be accepted, &lsquo;as long as it wasn&rsquo;t Peter Grant or  Maurice Johnston&rsquo;! Publicly however, as time went on, the old issue kept  reappearing, with the situation not helped by the fact that Souness was  a provocatively confrontational figure, who seemed to be always looking  for an enemy, and who now found himself at the centre of one of the  most heated and intense rivalries anywhere in world football.<br><br>Almost  inevitably, there were high-profile incidents; as early as November  1986, Johnston, then playing for Celtic, was involved in a particularly  notorious incident at the end of the Skol (League) Cup Final against  Rangers at Hampden, which would turn out to be Souness&rsquo; first trophy as  Ibrox manager. After being sent off late in the game, in the face of  gleeful abuse from the Rangers supporters, Johnston blessed himself as  he left the field. This was considered provocative firstly because,  although he was brought up in the faith, Johnston was not, unlike some  of his Celtic teammates, a practising Catholic and it was later pointed  out by an indignant press that the striker was the only member of  Celtic&rsquo;s large Catholic contingent who had not attended Mass on the  morning of the game.<br><br>At the time, Johnston&rsquo;s actions sparked  outrage. The idea that he might one day sign for Rangers seemed utterly  unthinkable. Yet a little over two and a half years later that&rsquo;s exactly  what happened. The striker had apparently grown restless with the slow  pace of life and the relatively low profile of football in France during  the period of his sabbatical from the Scottish game. After initially  vowing that he would never return to Scotland as a result of the  scrutiny and abuse which he was subjected to following the Skol Cup  final incident, Johnston announced publicly, in May 1989, that he was  indeed on the verge of returning to his boyhood heroes Celtic. The  Parkhead side were then managed by club legend Billy McNeill, who had  been made aware of the player&rsquo;s willingness to return home by his  captain Roy Aitken, whom Johnston had been entreating while the pair  were together on international duty with Scotland. Johnston was  subsequently paraded at a press conference wearing a Celtic shirt, where  he professed, amidst a lengthy roll call of footballing platitudes and  truisms, his undying love for the club. &lsquo;When I joined Celtic in 1984 it  was like an answer to prayers, and I don&rsquo;t say that lightly,&rsquo; the  striker assured readers of the Celtic View. &lsquo;At that time I fully  intended to see out my career at Celtic, if the club would have me,&rsquo; he  continued. &lsquo;I never fell out of love with Celtic&hellip; when I joined Nantes  it had always been my intention to return to Celtic one day. No one can  accuse me of being two-faced&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t intend to leave Celtic then and I  don&rsquo;t intend to now,&rsquo; Johnston maintained, while rumours of a desire to  join Manchester United were fabricated, chiefly because, &lsquo;There is no  other British club I could play for apart from Celtic.&rsquo;<br><br>The son  of a Protestant father and Catholic mother, Johnston attended St. Roch&rsquo;s  secondary school in the Royston area of Glasgow and supported Celtic as  a boy. He played for Partick Thistle, then Watford, before Parkhead  manager Davie Hay signed him as an intended replacement for Charlie  Nicholas, who had left Celtic for Arsenal the previous year, and he went  on to form a prolific partnership with Brian McClair, scoring 52 goals  in 100 appearances for the Parkhead side. After his infamous Celtic  press conference in May 1989, Johnston travelled with his proposed new  colleagues on the team bus to the club&rsquo;s final league fixture of the  season against St Mirren in Paisley, where winger Joe Miller scored the  only goal of the match to give Celtic a 1 &ndash; 0 win. The following week,  Miller repeated the feat, lighting up the showpiece Scottish Cup Final  with the game&rsquo;s solitary strike against Rangers, leaving Souness furious  at being denied a potential Treble. The Rangers manager is reported to  have told his players in the dressing room after the defeat that he had  something up his sleeve which would rock Celtic, and that the Parkhead  club had a shock coming. Something had evidently changed during the week  between Miller&rsquo;s two winning goals and over the summer rumours  continued to circulate that the proposed deal on Johnston&rsquo;s return to  Celtic might not be as cut and dried as everyone assumed. The fly in the  ointment seemed to be the player&rsquo;s agent Bill McMurdo, Agent Orange  himself, the same man who had represented Jock Wallace and whose Rangers  allegiances and political views were a matter of public record. McNeill  had informed Johnston that he would not deal with McMurdo and the  striker appeared to accept this condition when he signed a &lsquo;letter of  agreement&rsquo; to join Celtic, which, although not a contract, was later  ratified by FIFA as being legally binding, the equivalent of a  modern-day precontract agreement. It was on this basis that Celtic  decided to go ahead with the May press briefing and photo shoot, but the  jilted McMurdo sent a letter to the club informing them that it was his  company, rather than Nantes, who owned the player&rsquo;s registration and  that the agent could not therefore be bypassed in any transaction. While  Celtic were pondering the implications of all this, McMurdo was  offering the player to Souness on the other side of the city.<br><br>The  Rangers manager soon became aware of the contractual difficulties over  Johnston&rsquo;s proposed move to Celtic, and he immediately expressed an  interest in the striker. Souness admired the player and he persuaded the  club&rsquo;s new owner, David Murray, that with one swoop they could secure  the services of a talented forward who had apparently been destined for  Celtic and at the same time end the exclusionary signing policy, which  with every passing year was becoming more of a black mark on the club&rsquo;s  reputation. At the time FIFA were investigating racist and religious  prejudice in the game and Rangers&rsquo; unspoken policy was sure to come  under the microscope at some point, with the world governing body  holding the power to impose the ultimate sanction of withdrawing  licences and shutting errant football clubs down. Johnston and McMurdo  subsequently met Souness at the manager&rsquo;s Edinburgh home, where a deal  to bring the player to Rangers was agreed in principle.<br><br>Meanwhile  Celtic, who had been unable to contact Johnston over the close season,  were becoming increasingly aware that their putative deal for the  striker was unlikely ever to be completed. Souness and McMurdo had  turned the player and it wasn&rsquo;t long before Johnston was privately  threatening to quit football altogether if he was compelled to honour  the recent agreement with his former team. Despite the FIFA endorsed  letter, and with Nantes waiting expectantly for receipt of the &pound;800,000  balance which would conclude the transfer, the Parkhead club, faced with  the prospect of having an unhappy player on their hands, announced  publicly that they were pulling out of the deal. At the time McNeill was  still on holiday in Florida and he received his employers&rsquo; statement  down the telephone, read out to him by a journalist. Had Celtic dug  their heels in, they could have controlled Johnston&rsquo;s future &ndash; even if  he would never go on to play for the Parkhead club, they could have had a  hand in his ultimate destination.<br><br>As late as July 2, McMurdo  was still describing the rumours of a link with Rangers to the Sunday  Mail as, &lsquo;a complete fabrication &ndash; you can run that story for ten years  and it still wouldn&rsquo;t be true.&rsquo; When the paper&rsquo;s chief sports writer Don  Morrison called Ibrox to try and get to the bottom of the matter, he  was told by assistant manager Walter Smith, &lsquo;Remember the traditions of  this club and, if we were going to break them, it wouldn&rsquo;t be for that  ****.&rsquo;<br><br>But with Celtic now officially out of the way, things  moved forward quickly and the deal to bring Johnston to Rangers was  finally concluded in a Paris caf&eacute;. It seemed inevitable that news would  leak, despite all the mendacity and espionage, and by July 9 the  Scottish edition of The Sun appeared to have the story, thanks to a 16  year old trainee reporter who had noticed that Johnston&rsquo;s name had  mysteriously appeared on Rangers&rsquo; insurance documents, which were being  handled by his girlfriend&rsquo;s father. The young lad, having apparently  unearthed the biggest story in the history of Scottish football,  presumably with the help of his intended father-in-law, dutifully  conveyed his information to the paper&rsquo;s editor, Jack Irvine, who had  just stepped off a plane after holidaying with Souness in Majorca.  &lsquo;Print it,&rsquo; the Rangers manager eventually confirmed the story to  Irvine, who went ahead and devoted sixteen pages of Monday&rsquo;s paper to  their scoop. Still nobody could quite believe it, with the other papers,  clearly paralysed with incredulity, refusing to run the story, even  after early editions of The Sun hit the stands. It wasn&rsquo;t until Johnston  was unveiled at the press conference on the morning of Monday, July 10  that the rumours were finally confirmed. The striker was ushered into  the Blue Room alongside Souness and McMurdo, where he spoke, in more  guarded terms this time, to his astonished audience of his &lsquo;huge  admiration&rsquo; for the Ibrox club, something which, in amongst all the  Celtic-loving hyperbole, he&rsquo;d clearly managed to keep to himself up to  that point.<br><br>After Johnston&rsquo;s signing some Rangers fans burned  scarves, cancelled season tickets, and even laid wreathes at the gates  of Ibrox, while others who had perhaps seen a move of this nature coming  for some time were heard to observe, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not that I object to us  signing Catholics, I just didn&rsquo;t want us signing that Catholic.&rsquo; Fans  spokesman David Miller summed up the general mood when he told The  Herald, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a sad day for Rangers. There will be a lot of people  handing in their season tickets. I don&rsquo;t want to see a Roman Catholic at  Ibrox. It really sticks in my throat.&rsquo; Miller then went on to claim  that signing a Catholic from the continent would have been easier to  stomach. Within the club itself, opinion on Johnston&rsquo;s arrival appeared  to be divided; the English contingent at Ibrox, including Terry Butcher,  Chris Woods and Ray Wilkins seemed largely bewildered by all the fuss  and agreed to attend a press conference, welcoming the new player to the  club, but their Scottish counterparts declined the same request, and  refused to be photographed with Johnston, while Ibrox kitman and bus  driver, Jimmy Bell, snubbed the club&rsquo;s new acquisition, preferring not  to provide him with his playing gear and withholding chocolate bars from  the striker.<br><br>Over on the other side of the city, the Celtic  fans&rsquo; reacted to Johnston&rsquo;s perceived treachery with predictable fury.  They might not have believed every word of the striker&rsquo;s regurgitated  platitudes, but the last thing they could have expected was that he was  about to join their greatest rivals. The Celtic fanzine Not the View,  perhaps reflecting Johnston&rsquo;s penchant for overstatement, captured the  widespread sense of revulsion when they described the player as, &lsquo;the  human incarnation of the contents of Beelzebub&rsquo;s dustbin.&rsquo; Others dubbed  their former idol &lsquo;Judas&rsquo;, &lsquo;le petit merde&rsquo; and during Old Firm games  sang songs aimed at the forward, such as &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the Catholic in the  Blue?&rsquo; and &lsquo;What&rsquo;s it like to sign a Tim?&rsquo; At least they did for most of  the game, until in November 1989, Johnston scored an injury time winner  at Ibrox against his former club, silencing the Hoops faithful and  precipitating something of a turning point in his acceptance at Ibrox.<br><br>In  the aftermath of the signing, the press lavished Murray and Souness  with praise for finally allowing Rangers to employ a prominent Catholic  footballer, often with far greater enthusiasm than they had criticised  the club&rsquo;s now former, unofficial policy, which, given that it had just  been so spectacularly done away with, was now able to be openly  acknowledged. However, in retrospect, the signing of Maurice Johnston  has to be seen as something of a missed opportunity in the fight against  religious bigotry in Scottish football. In the years following the  signing, there appeared to ensue a period of equivocation, appeasement  and &lsquo;whataboutery&rsquo;, where Rangers fans and their apologists in the press  seemed more inclined to try to deflect the problem onto other clubs,  rather than acknowledge or attempt to deal with the ongoing issue at  Ibrox. Some even claimed that Rangers now occupied the moral high  ground, and the label of sectarianism could no longer be applied to the  club. What was lacking from Rangers was some sort of admission of  previous wrongdoing, or even a degree of humility or contrition after  the Johnston signing, but instead it was almost as if a switch had been  flicked: the club weren&rsquo;t employing Catholics before, but now they&rsquo;ve  bought one and they did it while managing to stick two fingers up at  their rivals at the same time. Perhaps as a result of the insensitive  way in which the Johnston signing was handled, Rangers continued to be  dogged over the ensuing years by the issue of sectarianism, which has  refused, even in more recent times when the club has been regularly  fielding Catholic footballers, to disassociate itself from the Ibrox  side.<br><br>Any notion that the signing of Maurice Johnston, and  Rangers&rsquo; subsequent recruitment of other Catholic players and even  coaches, might have brought about an end to the wider problems  associated with the club has proved to be misguided. Rangers supporters  in recent years have continued to sing sectarian songs from the stands  at Ibrox, even inventing new ones, such as The Famine Song, which was  first aired in 2008 and has been subsequently proscribed, and the  particularly unpleasant chant &lsquo;Big Jock Knew&rsquo;, a reference to a number  of cases of child abuse at Celtic Boys Club in the 1960s and 70s, which  was weaponised by Rangers fans and used as a stick to beat the Parkhead  club and its supporters.<br><br>As journalist Graham Spiers noted in  The Times when the slogan was first heard at Ibrox, &lsquo;I have to admit I  never thought I&rsquo;d ever see the day when Scottish football supporters  sang a song about a child sex abuse case, yet Rangers have duly  delivered. Even more amazing is Rangers FC&rsquo;s ongoing silence on the  matter, as this cretinous chant builds up its head of steam among  supporters.&rsquo; Spiers was correct about the increasingly frequent usage of  the slogan and &lsquo;Big Jock Knew&rsquo; or &lsquo;BJK&rsquo; later migrated from the Ibrox  stands to become a ubiquitous acronym graffitied around Glasgow as well  as a salutation used by Rangers fans when they greeted one another in  the street.<br><br>In the end, rather than any domestic authority, it  was the European governing body UEFA who took exception to Rangers&rsquo;  sectarian songbook and sanctioned the club after a number of high  profile cases in the 2000s, including, in May 2006, a fine accompanied  by a warning over any future misconduct, after incidents of hooliganism  and bigotry surrounding the club&rsquo;s Champions League tie earlier in the  year with Villarreal. Privately, UEFA were disturbed and appalled when  they uncovered what was still going on at Ibrox in the 21st century,  with one official telling Spiers, &lsquo;Yes we have racism today in football  and many other problems. But it still shocking to us that, in the year  2006, we still have supporters in Glasgow shouting &lsquo;**** the Pope&rsquo; and  such things. We thought the world had moved on from this.&rsquo;<br><br>The  signing of Maurice Johnston may not have been the seminal moment that  many were hoping for in regards to the wider problem of anti-Catholicism  at Ibrox and in the wider community, but over the ensuing years, once  Rangers had officially abandoned its dogmatic, discriminatory policies,  it was as if the floodgates had been opened and a raft of Catholic  players eventually arrived at the club, most of them foreigners, at a  time when British football was opening up its doors to the world.  Rangers have now been captained by a Catholic, and managed by a  Catholic, an unqualifiedly welcome development, which has rightly  exposed all the old lies and excuses about outsiders supposedly not  being able to fully commit to the team&rsquo;s cause. The present day Ibrox  club has no compunction at all about signing footballers from all  backgrounds, including even players from the Republic of Ireland,  something that would have been unthinkable in Souness&rsquo;s day.<br><br>So,  in the end, we got there with Rangers, even if at times it felt as  though the old institution had to be dragged kicking and screaming into  the 21st century. The extent of the club&rsquo;s denials and equivocations  down the years, however, has inevitably left many observers unconvinced  about the nature of the progress within Ibrox, with the glaring lack of  contrition or humility, coupled with the ongoing problems amongst the  club&rsquo;s fans and even directors, suggesting that the changes at the club  have been largely cosmetic and have been adopted chiefly for reasons of  expediency. Regardless, what can be said with some certainty about the  club is that Rangers lost the battle of ideas, in the present and in the  past, of what football clubs were supposed to be for and what the game  had the potential to achieve in an often troubled society, and in the  years since the Johnston signing, the club has subsequently faced  numerous and, in the end sadly, catastrophic difficulties in facing up  to its past.<br><br>This article is an edited extract  from &lsquo;Tangled up in Blue, The Rise and Fall of Rangers FC&rsquo; by Stephen  O&rsquo;Donnell, published by Pitch.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br><div>2019 - Sevco found guilty of &#39;racist&#39; chanting in two away games in Europe by UEFA and made to close minimum 3000 seats at Ibrox.
