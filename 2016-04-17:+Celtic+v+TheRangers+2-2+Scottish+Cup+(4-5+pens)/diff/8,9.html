They deserved it, we  sure as **** did not. But will anything change now? No one knows really<br><br>(fatboab of KDS)<br>A few hours later and it still baffles me why our players looked so  unfit. Surely that was Deilas main target, to have an all running, high  pressing superfit team who would dominate games against even the likes  of Batcelona. That&#39;s what he told us, and all this talk of diet and  lifestyle that so upset our sensitive , caring footballers would  revolutionise our squad.<br>Bollocks Deila. You have created a team with  no heart , no leadership, and as unfit a side as I can ever remember in  the hoops. We were playing with about 5 players in extra time.<br>If  results don&#39;t get rid of you, this catastrophic failure to implement  what you told us you would should see your feet not touch the ground and  the end of your tenure should come swiftly.<br>We lack any ability to  keep the ball. Griffiths as a lone striker is hopeless, our midfield  laughable and as for our lightweight wingers, give me feckin&#39; strength.<br>Our signing policy has failed . We have wasted money on no marks who couldn&#39;t even get a sub place against a Championship side.<br>The  problems go straight to the heart of our boardroom. We have to act and  act soon, or this is going to be a regular occurrence next season.<br>To  all you lurkers, your team played well for 30 minutes,  and deserved a  draw, but rest assured, that was not the Celtic you will see next  season. <br><br>(andy d of KDS)<br>Today made for grim viewing, but also for some reflection on my part.<br>I  have been gradually losing patience with many aspects of the club over  the last couple of years. This year in particular has been utterly  gruesome. <br>Whether it be the spineless nature of the players, the  cluelessness of the management team, or the miserliness of the board,  along with its political agenda.<br>They have all contributed in no small part to my decision to spend less on Celtic.<br>No season ticket, no new jersey, no family do at the restaurant, no stadium tour for friends from abroad. <br>Possibly the odd home or away game, depending on how the mood takes me.<br>After  watching the team consistently since 1985, I now feel that I am no  longer in touch with too many aspects of the club in it&#39;s present guise.<br>This is not some boo hoo spitting the dummy out kind of gesture on the back of todays result.<br>It was perhaps the straw that broke the camels back. <br><br><br>(44bhoy of KDS)<br>That was just like most games we&#39;ve played this seasons. Teams easily  pass the ball around us and get up the pitch unhindered. We looked  drained and incapable of sustained effort, and like we&#39;re not that  bothered.<br><br>We don&#39;t retain possession and make poor pass choices -  all the time. Long balls to LG...pointless. Our open play goal was  created by our teenage POTY. He beat his man and laid it perfectly to  Rogic. I wish his teammates were more like teammates than guys who want  to score goals from 30 yards and balloon it.<br><br>Roberts might never get over that miss. I might, eventually.<br><br>There  was quite a bit to admire about newco&#39;s play. They were not afraid of  the ball, or taking on a man, or good passes. Well, at least that&#39;s our  first defeat to them out of the way. I have to remind myself that there  is loss, and there is liquidation.

who made a rare visit to watch them yesterday &ndash; to consider Deila&rsquo;s position.<br> Tom Rogic, who had rescued Celtic in extra time, reacts after missing his penalty. Picture: SNS Group<br></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Celtic certainly require improvement ahead of the renewed and robust challenge they can expect to face from Warburton&rsquo;s side in the top flight next season.<br><br> Rangers caused Celtic more trouble in the opening couple of minutes of this game than they had throughout the whole of the utterly one-sided League Cup semi-final between the clubs last season. That set the tone for a bright and enterprising display from Warburton&rsquo;s side who were true to his pre-match pledge that they would not compromise the adventurous style of play they have adopted throughout the campaign.<br> Celtic, so used to dominating possession in the majority of their Premiership fixtures, found themselves on the back foot early on as Miller forced a fine save from Craig Gordon when he latched on to a clever pass from the outstanding McKay in the sixth minute.<br> In response, Scott Brown missed a premium chance to put Celtic in front four minutes later but on a day when little went right for their out-of-sorts captain, he drilled his right-foot shot wide from around 14 yards.<br> Rangers were well worth the 16th-minute lead provided by Miller. Brown&rsquo;s weak clearance of a James Tavernier free-kick fell to Dom Ball who quickly fed Andy Halliday on the right. His cross looked harmless until Brown inadvertently turned it into the path of Miller, who swept his 19th goal of the season beyond Gordon from close range.<br> Celtic were clearly rattled and struggled to bring any sustained cohesion to their passing. They made an early change when Dedryck <br> Boyata, who had endured a torrid opening 25 minutes, was replaced in defence by pre-match injury doubt Sviatchenko.<br> The big Dane brought greater solidity for Deila&rsquo;s men, who should have equalised through Patrick Roberts. The on-loan Manchester City winger was one of Celtic&rsquo;s brighter performers but he will be haunted for some time by an inexplicable miss which saw him slice the ball wide of an empty net from a couple of yards out after a Leigh Griffiths shot had rebounded off Foderingham&rsquo;s left-hand post.The jeers of the Celtic supporters were primarily directed towards Deila when the half-time whistle blew, leaving the Norwegian facing the most critical team talk of his tenure.<br> He duly got a positive response from his team, whose aggressive start to the second half was rewarded when Sviatchenko made it <br> 1-1 five minutes after the restart, rising above Danny Wilson to meet a Roberts corner and head firmly beyond Foderingham.<br> But rather than being able to seize the initiative from that point, Celtic&rsquo;s greater share of possession in the second 45 minutes was not matched by any greater threat or dominance as an attacking force.<br> Nir Bitton missed the best chance to win the tie in regulation time, heading over from a Roberts free-kick, but Rangers were more than worth taking it into an extra 30 minutes.<br> With Nicky Clark on for Miller, the veteran striker having run himself to a standstill, Rangers regained the lead six minutes into extra-time with a stunning strike from McKay. He was fortunate the opportunity came his way from a disputed throw-in on the right which should have been awarded to Celtic but was given to Rangers by referee Craig Thomson, who errantly overruled his assistant.<br> That said, McKay still had plenty to do as he engineered a yard of space beyond Brown&rsquo;s challenge and smashed a right-foot shot beyond Gordon&rsquo;s right-hand high into the net from around 25 yards.<br> It was a goal fit to win any cup tie but there were still plenty of this remarkable script left to unfold. Celtic equalised for the second time a minute into the second period of extra-time, Rogic meeting Kieran Tierney&rsquo;s cutback to drive a precise left-foot shot wide of Foderingham&rsquo;s left hand.<br> Celtic came closest to a winner before the need for penalties with Griffiths watching in agony as his 118th-minute free-kick was touched on to the bar by Foderingham, the ball rebounding against the keeper&rsquo;s back and drifting inches wide.<br> So, for the first time since the 1974 Drybrough Cup final, we had an Old Firm penalty shoot-out. Halliday and <br> Charlie Mulgrew confidently converted their teams&rsquo; first penalties, before Tavernier and Callum McGregor both failed.<br> The pattern continued as McKay and Bitton scored, then Clark and Brown were denied by saves from Gordon and Foderingham. <br> The next five kicks &ndash; from Lee Wallace, Gedion Zelalem and Nicky Law for Rangers and Griffiths and Mikael Lustig for Celtic &ndash; were all scored before Rogic suffered the agony of missing the decisive penalty which he scooped over the crossbar.<br> Read more: http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/rangers-2-2-celtic-5-4-on-pens-gers-stun-hoops-in-semi-1-4102648#ixzz46A12wQzI</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>    BBC<br><br>By Richard Wilson<br><br>BBC Scotland at Hampden<br>  Rangers set up a Scottish Cup final with Hibernian after a thrilling tussle with Celtic was settled on penalties.<br><br>Tom Rogic, who levelled in extra time for Celtic, missed the vital spot-kick, blazing high and wide.<br><br>Rangers striker Kenny Miller fired in the opening goal, with Celtic replying through an Erik Sviatchenko header.<br><br>A wonderful long-range strike from Barrie McKay had Rangers in front on 96 minutes before Rogic swept home to set up a tense Hampden shootout.<br><br>James Tavernier and Nicky Clark failed to convert from the spot for Rangers, while Callum McGregor and captain Scott Brown could not hit the target for Celtic before Rogic&#39;s miss made it 5-4 on penalties to the Championship winners.<br><br>Minutes before the penalties, a thunderous free-kick from Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths crashed off the crossbar and bounced off goalkeeper Wes Foderingham before slipping narrowly wide.<br><br>Foderingham also made a good stop to deny Rogic from close range after the Australian substitute had scored to make it 2-2.<br><br>A pulsating, engrossing and always combative Old Firm game ended with several players out on their feet, barely able to move.<br><br>The game had been a relentless affair from the outset.

The breakthrough came when Tavernier delivered a poor corner kick that led to the ball breaking to Andy Halliday. His cross in turn was also mis-hit, but the ball cannoned off Brown into the path of Miller, who finished coolly.<br><br>With Halliday and Jason Holt pushing forward in central midfield, Rangers were composed and assertive.
