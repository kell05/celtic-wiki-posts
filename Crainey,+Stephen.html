He was very proud of his debut match, as he put it:</div><div></div><blockquote><i>&quot;My debut came right out of the blue. I was training with the Youth team and somebody said, &ldquo;Tommy Burns is looking for you&rdquo;. I was like, &ldquo;What have I done wrong&rdquo;? I went to go and see him and he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in the squad tomorrow&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;are you serious&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;yes you are&rdquo;. At this point I was thinking, I could do something here that I&rsquo;ve dreamt about since I started walking. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep the night before with lots of different scenarios going through my head.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>Niggling injuries and a new manager in Martin O&rsquo;Neill meant Crainey&rsquo;s career was then somewhat sidelined but he fought his way back into first team recognition and during the 2001-02 season he put in some fine performances against Rangers and Valencia to help earn him a Scotland call-up. He scored his only goal when Celtic beat Hearts 5&ndash;2 in the quarter-final of the 2000&ndash;01 Scottish League Cup. <br><br>He never managed to win a long run, and in seasons 2001/02 and the great 2002/03 season that saw Celtic reach the UEFA Cup final, he played in 19 games in both seasons, either coming on as a sub or in as a fill-in. So showed some faith in him from the management team. <br><br>He even managed a couple of appearances in the matches against minnows FK Suduva on the &#39;Road to Seville&#39;, which in the bigger scheme of things is a memory to treasure when you look back on what was achieved that season. He was a regular for the first half of the 2002/03 season (domestically), and Celtic never lost a game he played in that season.<br><br>However it seemed that Crainey never really convinced O&rsquo;Neill for a permanent First XI place. After a lack of first team starts it was no surprise when he finally departed Parkhead in February 2004 to sign for Premiership Southampton in a &pound;500,000 deal. In some ways a disappointing decision as left-back has been a difficult position to fill, and the very able Ulrik Laursen was chosen ahead of Stephen Crainey, although Crainey has said that Martin O&#39;Neill did want him to remain.<br><br>His last match was a 2-1 defeat to Hibs in the league cup, and really he deserved better than that for his final note in the first team, it was his first loss with Celtic for two seasons, and actually this was his only loss domestically with Celtic (the other defeat was to Valencia in the UEFA Cup). <br><br>He had managed to play for Celtic in a CIS Cup final (the League Cup final of 2000/01) when Celtic beat Kilmarnock 3-0 in the final so won a medal by playing in the final match which he more than fully deserved (having come on as a sub for Bobby Petta).<br><br>He was going to leave Celtic with an excellent record to look back on, and many great memories.<br><br>We wished him the best.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>After a disappointing spell on the south coast with Southampton, the six times capped defender moved on to a struggling Leeds side and after being released from Elland Road he then joined Blackpool in July 2007. It was a great move for him, and he swept the board at the Lancashire club&#39;s POTY awards in his first season and helped them win an unlikely promotion to the English Premier League in 2009-10. He was to become a firm favourite at Blackpool and stuck with them even after they went back down to the second tier. <br><br>Following his success down south, he was given a second birth on the international stage, and played a handful of games around 2010-11 for Scotland, which is a great measure of his success and ability.<br><br>He later played for Wigan then various smaller sides in England before wrapping his playing career up around 2015. <br><br>He then moved into coaching, and at time of writing (2018) was a coach at Fleetwood Town with the youth.<br><h3></h3>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career<br></h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">1997-04</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">19 (22)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">2 (3)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">6 (1)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">3 (2)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">30 (28)</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>Scottish League</b><br><ul><li><font color="#333333"><font size="2"> </font><a href="/page/2001" target="_self"><font size="2">2000-01</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/2002" target="_self"><font size="2">2001-02</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/2004" target="_self"><font size="2">2003-04</font></a></font></li></ul><div><b>Scottish Cup</b></div><div><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+2000-2001" target="_self">2001</a></font></li></ul></div><div><b>Scottish League Cup</b></div><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2000-01</a></font></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Crainey%2C+Stephen+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>From Not the View</h3>  A six figure sum for - let&#39;s be honest - a peripheral first team player that we paid nowt for anyway? Sold!<br><br>I  suppose that&#39;s one of the reasons the youth set up exists. One of  Crainey&#39;s big selling points was the fact that he was a naturally  left-footed defender, traditionally a problem position for us. During  the 80s we had Graeme Sinclair, Brain Whittaker and Anton. The 90s dealt  us the skilful but diffident Wdowcyzk followed by the dire Lee Martin.  Of course Boyd was there, but he isn&#39;t left sided, and moved to central  defence in any case. Tosh McKinlay couldn&#39;t really defend but could  deliver a mean cross, while Mahe got very mean if you crossed him, and  sported a bizarre Mohawk haircut for a while.<br><br>Hardly a hall of fame.<br><br>The  first time most Celtic fans clapped eyes on Crainey was grainy black  and white footage of him weaving in and out of milk bottles pretending  to be the young Jimmy Johnstone in a mock up flash back sequence for the  Jinky video. But let&#39;s face it you can&#39;t make a serious judgement of a  player&#39;s ability based on that, so let&#39;s move on.<br><br>Crainey first  appeared, like so many of our young players, at the tail-end of season  1999-2000 as Kenny Dalglish tried to stir up some interest in the string  of meaningless games that we were playing. Tall, reasonable pace and a  decent tackler he didn&#39;t look too bad at all. He could also hit a decent  free kick, as Hibs found out.<br><br>The following season under OFM he  found himself used mostly in the CIS Cup, scoring a cracking equaliser  at Tynecastle and eventually gaining a winners medal having replaced the  bludgeoned Petta after about 5 minutes of the final against Kilmarnock.<br><br>His  big chance came the following season in Valencia. Due to injury and  family illness we found our squad somewhat stretched prior to game in  Spain. Crainey was drafted in and certainly didn&#39;t let anyone down in an  extremely tough game.<br><br>He featured in a fair number of league  games after that, making his Old Firm debut in a 1:1 draw at Ibrox in  Spring 2002, but to be truthful many fans had already arrived at the  opinion that Crainey wasn&#39;t going to be a serious long term player for  us. As long as people are trying to get down the wing he&#39;s fine; as soon  as they cut inside him he&#39;s nowhere. Last season at Dens Park even Mark  Burchill did it to him, and scored.<br><br>On the plus side, he&#39;s good  in the air, still quite quick, and hits a pretty decent pass. Wee  Strachan signed him, but now he has no idea who will be picking the side  at St. Mary&#39;s.<br><br>We wish him well.<br>AB MURDOCH<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>&lsquo;Seville was<font color="#333333"> something special,&rsquo; Stephen Crainey, my pride in playing for Celtic</font></h3><font face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br><font size="3"><a href="https://thecelticstar.com/seville-something-special-stephen-crainey-pride-playing-celtic/" target="_self">https://thecelticstar.com/seville-something-special-stephen-crainey-pride-playing-celtic/</a><br></font><font size="3">By Editor</font><font size="3"> </font><font size="3"> &mdash; 19 April, 2018<br></font><font size="3"> </font><font size="3"><br>  Stephen was at Celtic for seven years and was part of the squad in that  memorable season that saw us reach that UEFA Cup Final in Seville.<br> <br>  Stephen grew up as a Celtic fan so to wear the Hoops was for himself,  his family and his friends, something that they are all immensely proud  of.<br> <br> You can follow Stephen on Twitter @crainzo<br> <br> As ever, The Celtic Star reporter Scotty Alcroft asks the questions&hellip;<br> <br><b>  You started out at Celtic in the Youth setup. What was that like for  you and what players came through with you at that time that went on to  have good careers?</b><br> <br> The Youth team that I came through in was an  excellent side. We used to play all the English sides at that time and  beat them all convincingly. I think in part it was down to the tempo we  had in training and that helped me. We had some great players but the  names that spring to mind are, Mark Burchill, Jamie Smith, Colin Healy  and Liam Miller. The grounding we had at Celtic would certainly help us  as our careers progressed. This was certainly the case for me.<br> <br><b> How did the step up to the first team happen and how did it feel knowing that you were going to play for Celtic?</b><br> <br>  My debut came right out of the blue. I was training with the Youth team  and somebody said, &ldquo;Tommy Burns is looking for you&rdquo;. I was like, &ldquo;What  have I done wrong&rdquo;? I went to go and see him and he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re in the  squad tomorrow&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;are you serious&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;yes you are&rdquo;. At  this point I was thinking, I could do something here that I&rsquo;ve dreamt  about since I started walking. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep the night before with  lots of different scenarios going through my head.<br> <br><b> Who was your biggest influence at Celtic?</b><br> <br>  My biggest influence was Tommy Burns. The standards he set in training  were nothing short of 100%. He demanded that in everything we did and  that stuck with me throughout the rest of my career. One day I went in  to training and Tommy shook my hand and said &ldquo;good morning&rdquo;. I replied  to him the same back to which he grabbed my hand and said, &ldquo;shake my  hand as if you mean it like a proper man&rdquo;.<br> You can imagine how I shook his hand the next day.<br> <br><b> Who were the characters in the dressing room at Celtic?</b><br> <br>  That squad that won the treble under Martin O&rsquo;Neill was incredibly  strong and full of characters so it&rsquo;s difficult to single out one  player. The way Paul Lambert treated me as a kid coming through was  great. He made you feel really relaxed, especially before games. He  would say stuff like, &ldquo;Stephen, just play your normal game&rdquo; just to make  me feel at ease. On Friday&rsquo;s if we had a game on the Saturday, we would  play a older players against the younger ones in a small sided game.  You&rsquo;d think the older ones would go easy on us but that certainly wasn&rsquo;t  the case. They would go full on at times which I loved.<br> <br> They  wouldn&rsquo;t hold back but that was me learning about the demands that were  at Celtic and that second best wasn&rsquo;t going to be tolerated. It was a  great test of character for young players coming through. I remember big  John Hartson who is a complete gentleman by the way, giving me an elbow  in training and I was like, &ldquo;WTF are you doing&rdquo;? to which he replied,  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting it again&rdquo; to which I replied, &ldquo;come on then&rdquo;!! I&rsquo;m  laughing now thinking about it. I think now looking back that it was  just the senior players testing out our mentality possibly. Young versus  old at Celtic were the best sessions I ever done in training throughout  my career.<br> <br><b> Not a lot of Celtic fans will know this  but I remember it well, you played a young Jimmy Johnstone once, tell us  about that Stephen.</b><br> <br> Yes that&rsquo;s right!! I played the part of  Jimmy Johnstone as a kid for his video. I was just sitting in my Mum&rsquo;s  house one night and the phone goes. I answered and it went along the  lines of, &ldquo;hi this is such and such, would you like to play the part of  Jinky as a kid&rdquo;? Before they had finished I said yes. Myself and my  sister Pauline then went to Jinky&rsquo;s house in Uddingston where I met him  and his family. They set milk bottles up in his living room and I had to  dribble through them, just like he did as a kid. We then went to the  local junior park where he used to practice balancing on the railings  there and I&rsquo;d dribble on the pitch etc. It was a great honour not only  to meet the great man but to be asked to play that part. LEGEND<br> <br><b> What is your proudest achievement from your time at Celtic?</b><br> <br>  My proudest achievement was making my debut at Paradise. I had been a  fan like many other children and my dream was to play for Celtic at 18  and it was like a dream come true. We beat St Johnstone that day 4-2 at  Parkhead where I came on as a second half substitute. After the game I  can remember going back to my Mum and Dad&rsquo;s and all my family and  friends were there. I walked in and they all started cheering to which I  just burst out crying with the emotion. I then opened a bottle of  Champagne to spray in my Mum&rsquo;s kitchen. You can imagine what she was  saying to me whilst shouting at me as well haha.<br> <br><b> You played  your part in the &ldquo;Road To Seville&rdquo; with a couple of games against FK  Suduva. What was it like to be a part of that famous squad?</b><br> <br> To  be involved in that squad that got to Seville was something special. I  played in a couple of games in the earlier rounds. To get to the final  and lose in the manner in which we we did was heartbreaking. Looking  back now though, it was a magnificent achievement by all connected with  the club. I&rsquo;ve never witnessed scenes like it!! On the way to the  Stadium, the roads were just full of Green and White. People were  sleeping in the street and travelling for days just to be there. We&rsquo;re  not the best fans in the World for nothing!!<br> <br><b> How did your departure from Celtic come about? Was MON honest with you and tell you that you weren&rsquo;t in his plans?</b><br> <br>  It was the toughest decision of my life when I left the club that I&rsquo;ve  always loved and still love. Martin phoned me one night and said,  &ldquo;Stephen, Southampton have made a bid for you&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;Do you want me  to leave&rdquo;? He said,&rdquo;nope but I thought I&rsquo;d phone and tell you&rdquo;. The more  I thought about it, I&rsquo;d played a few games with Pughy being a regular, I  didn&rsquo;t want my heart to rule my head. I didn&rsquo;t want to be a bit part  player so I decided for my career that it was best for me to move on,  which I did. I then went on to play for Southampton, Leeds, Blackpool,  Wigan and Fleetwood. When I look back and ask myself, did I make the  right choice? Yes I did, but what a tough decision it was.<br> <br><b> We have a young man at Celtic at the minute that plays in your old position. Just how highly do you rate KT?</b><br> <br>  Kieran Tierney for me is one of the best young full backs around!! He  can defend, tackle, get forward to score and also create goals. Myself  being a selfish fan, I hope that we can keep him for many more years to  come. There will be big teams wanting him but as Celtic are the biggest  club in the world, he can go on and become a legend of the club. He has a  great relationship with the fans, the possibility of us getting that  magical #10IAR and hopefully we can keep him here along with our great  manager. A top, top player!!<br> <br><b> Finally Stephen, what do you think of the job Brendan Rodgers is doing and what&rsquo;s your thoughts on this current Celtic side?</b><br> <br>  Brendan has done wonders at Celtic and this squad he has built can do  something special in my eyes. Back to back trebles can be won for the  first time in our History. The philosophy he believes in is great to  watch. It&rsquo;s the proper Celtic way. I hope he stays for many more years  to come and keeps creating history which as a Celtic family, we all love  doing. HH<br> <br><b> Scotty Says&hellip;</b><br> <br> Stephen that was  outstanding and truly from the heart. Your love for the club is there  for all to see. It&rsquo;s amazing how many of my guests have mentioned Tommy  Burns. His example has been followed by so many and it just shows how  great a man he truly was. That Jinky story is a cracker too. Another  legend of our club who is missed hugely as well. You&rsquo;re spot on about  Seville. I was lucky enough to be inside the Stadium that night and it  was the biggest emotional rollercoaster of my life and still is to this  day. The stories that I could tell also haha. An incredible experience  and just devastated still that we didn&rsquo;t manage to pull it off that  night. Thanks very much for doing this and we at &ldquo;The Celtic Star&rdquo; wish  you all the best for the future and hopefully we&rsquo;ll all see you at  Celtic Park soon to watch the Bhoys.
