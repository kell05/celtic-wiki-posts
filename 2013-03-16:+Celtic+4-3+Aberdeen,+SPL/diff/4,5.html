Not the first time recently we&#39;ve managed that trick against the Dons. <br><br>However, the same recent failures stick out like a sore thumb. We created a few good chances in the first half, but the intensity wasn&#39;t there at all. It looked like, again, a few players were treating the match like it was won. We only really started to show any urgency at 1-2, and the fluke goal at 1-3 finally awoke them from their slumber. Wilson and Ambrose had shocking moments - again. The latter doesn&#39;t know whether he is coming or going. For their second goal, he stepped way out of possession leaving a massive gap at the back. I know he used to play in Israel, but making our defence seem like the Red Sea is a bit much. Wilson should have dealt with their first by either hitting it back to the keeper or horsing it away into the stand. The keeper didn&#39;t cover himself in glory for their second. <br><br>That said, what a finish by Samaras for the winner. Hope Craigy enjoyed his last visit to Parkhead.<br><br><i>(corky b of KDS forum)</i><br>That second half is why you go to the football. The feeling at the end is unbeatable. BUT after 60 mins I&#39;d have wanted half the team hunted.<br><br>Foster : Anyone not worried by his form since his injury needs their head looked at. Went down like the Titanic at the second goal and stupidly gave away a corner for the third<br>Lustig - Did what he was supposed to do today<br>Ambrose - I see he&#39;s getting some stick BUT I thought he was all right today. Didn&#39;t floof about<br>Wilson - Has been excellent for much of this season but his last few displays have been horrendous. Today was as poor as anything last season.<br>Izzy - Good in terms of over-lapping and overall urgency crossing poor and poor control led to the attack for the third goal.<br>Kayal - Hooked again before 2/3rds of a game. Taxi<br>Mulgrew - Showed urgency throughout and set piece were dangerous but still not convinced with him in midfield<br>Ledley - Reportedly earns &pound;20K a week. Not worth a wage increase IMHO.<br>Stokes - Deservedly hooked - taxi<br>Hooper - Didn&#39;t show much but he did what was necessary in the last few minutes<br>Commons - Another infuriating performance. Good in bits (and an excellent goal) but other moments leave you tearing your hair out.<br>Sammi - Was good when he came on - great goal<br>Lassad - Have we signed two of Europe&#39;s physically weakest strikers in him &amp; Miku ?<br><br><b><br>(on the kettling of the GB)<img align="right" alt="[Untitled]" height="296" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/K91NqIZsfrNv6lA7STW3Lw123969/GW397H296" title="[Untitled]" width="397"><br>A Burning Pride16 Mar 2013, 11:02 PM</b>   <div>  I was there for the entire duration of the &#39;event&#39; today, I saw no trouble at all being started by the GB. Any incidents which did occur came as a result, in my opinion, of over zealous policing. The weight of numbers of the police was completely and utterly unwarranted. This included probably hundreds of cops, horses, 6 or 8 riot vans and a helicopter. I&#39;ve photographed loads of SDL/EDL events with counter protestors present with serious nutters in attendance, which were not anywhere near as heavily policed as this.</div>  <blockquote>  <div>  </div></blockquote>  <div>  Any pushing/shoving, came after the police attempted to herd the protestors in. I saw a group of young lads break away and head towards the Gallowgate and it was at this point the batons were drawn (basically as kids were running away). I then saw a few lads being hauled about by the police and a bit of a stand off but again they were met with drawn batons. The situation escalated only because of the way the police handled it, IMO. I believe the police mission today was to not allow the corteo to go ahead under any circumstances. I have to say that some of the police there today were polite and approached the situation well and with some sense when asking people to move on and disperse but others seemed right up for a bit of a ruck. </div>  <div>  </div>  <div>  After herding in those who remained (a sizeable majority, who stood peacefully, singing &quot;supporting your team, is not a crime&quot;), the senior cop read a statement aloud on a megaphone and told them they would be released in two&#39;s as he believed to do otherwise would risk public safety or words to that effect. It was absolutely ridiculous and completely OTT. </div>  <div>  </div>  <div>  I&#39;ve seen pitched battles in Glasgow involving far more &#39;active&#39; people with bottles being thrown, etc and it wasn&#39;t dealt with in anything like the way today was. I reckon today was a carefully planned operation, there was even police medics standing in the wings to deal with any injuries. </div>  <div>  </div>  <div>  The whole situation is madness. </div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3>  <div>  <div class="home-team">  <h3 class="team-name">  Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list">  <li>  01 Forster   </li><li>  03 Izaguirre   </li><li>  04 Ambrose   </li><li>  06 Wilson   </li><li>  21 Mulgrew   </li><li>  23 Lustig   </li><li>  15 Commons   </li><li>  16 Ledley   </li><li>  33 Kayal (Samaras - 61&#39;

Aberdeen - Vernon (45), Magennis (53, 60)<br><br>Bookings: Aberdeen - Reynolds, Anderson, Shaughnessy, Pawlett, Magennis<br><br>It was a goal worthy of winning any match but it was a blow to the nether regions of an Aberdeen side who must have felt they had the match wrapped up.<br><br>After a contest like this one, Craig Brown is probably relieved that he is retiring from the dug-out come the end of the season. The Aberdeen boss has never managed a winning SPL team at Parkhead, and for the longest time, his players have struggled to carve out goals.<br><br>On the day that they managed to bang three in, at Celtic Park of all places, he still couldn&rsquo;t celebrate victory. No wonder he feels that the time is right to move upstairs.<br><br>It was a defeat that hurt the entire Pittodrie side. The players slumped to the turf at the sound of the final whistle, their heads in hands, betraying their bewilderment at just how they had contrived to take nothing whatsoever from the game.<br><br>At 3-1 up with just 25 minutes remaining they looked relatively comfortable. But a succession of set pieces saw Celtic overhaul them in the dying seconds of time added on as Georgios Samaras&rsquo; lovely overhead kick proved unstoppable.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just embarrassed,&rdquo; admitted Aberdeen striker Josh Magennis. He had scored twice but claimed the goals served as no consolation.<br><br>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you score five, if you lose 6-5 they don&rsquo;t matter. To be 3-1 up at Parkhead and then lose set pieces like that is so disappointing. The boys can&rsquo;t believe what has happened.&rdquo;<br><br>He said it was as bad as he has felt after a loss, matching any of the disappointment he has felt at defeats to lower-league teams in the cup competitions.<br><br>&ldquo;Until the madness happened, we did well. We looked comfortable and didn&rsquo;t feel under threat.&rdquo; But the threat was there in the guise of set pieces.<br><br>It would have been nice for the Dons to get the three points to move into the top six and give their departing gaffer the end to the season he has targeted.<br><br>&ldquo;If we had won that would have gone a long way to cementing that,&rdquo; added Magennis.<br><br>Instead, Aberdeen were left lamenting what might have been.<br><br>Both managers wanted a reaction. Celtic had some making up to do after last weekend&rsquo;s defeat, while Aberdeen were hoping to wrestle something from the match to enhance their chances of making it into the top six.<br><br>Neil Lennon thought he was getting the kind of response he had demanded when his team grabbed the opener straight from the kick-off. An incredible 12 seconds was all it took, Kris Commons, firing a shot from the left across Jamie Langfield and into his goal.<br><br>Given the paucity of Aberdeen&rsquo;s scoring efforts this term, some may have believed that the game was therefore over before it had really begun. But Celtic weren&rsquo;t firing on all cylinders and their defensive frailties were again evident as Kelvin Wilson was robbed in his own area for the equaliser a minute before the break and was again found wanting as Aberdeen edged in front just seven minutes into the second half.<br><br>The first goal was courtesy of Magennis taking the ball off him in the area and laying it back for Scott Vernon to slam home.<br><br>The second was a Magennis finish and that goal breathed life into a match that had been close to flatlining in the opening 45 minutes, the football looking flaccid and lacking real passion and penetration. The same accusation could not be made after the break and, building on that 52nd-minute goal, Aberdeen made it 3-1. This time it was Gavin Rae who picked up a loose ball and fired in a long-range effort, which was deflected past Forster by the outstretched foot of Magennis.<br><br>In response to that, Lennon sent on Samaras and Lassad Nouioui and suddenly the home side were taking the game to their guests, the comeback sparked in the 67th minute when Charlie Mulgrew drilled his shot home from 12 yards.<br><br>In the 86th minute, Hooper drew Celtic level, coming off best in a game of head tennis in the box following a corner.<br><br>But then came the winner. With just seconds of the four minutes of added-on time left, Samaras latched onto a Lassad nod down at the back post and, with wonderful technique, sent an overhead kick high into the Aberdeen net.<br><br>&ldquo;People have accused players of complacency and not having enough desire but when the fourth goal went in you could see what it meant to them,&rdquo; said the delighted Celtic manager.<br><br>&ldquo;We are having a few defensive problems and we have to sort them out. We are giving away cheap goals but the desire to win was fantastic.&rdquo; <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  BBC</h3>By Kheredine Idessane BBC Scotland at Celtic Park  <br>Comments (78)<br><br>Celtic underlined why they will soon be crowned Scottish Premier League champions with an astonishing fightback to beat Aberdeen in a seven-goal thriller.<br><br>There were a full 94 minutes on the clock when substitute Georgios Samaras stooped to score with a clever overhead kick to cap a most dramatic afternoon.<br><br>The home side were 3-1 down after an hour, with Kris Commons&#39; first minute strike equalised by Scott Vernon, before an early second-half double from Josh Magennis put the Dons two clear.<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew began the Celtic comeback with a deflected shot before top-scorer Gary Hooper bundled the ball in four minutes from the end of normal time to bring the match level, and fully to the boil, in front of a noisy home crowd.<br><br>If the Celtic supporters were jubilant at that, they cranked up the volume even further when Samaras met fellow sub Lassad&#39;s added-time knockdown to hook the ball home with his back to goal.<br><br>It was a sensational goal to end a sensational match, which was book-ended with two fine goals, 95 minutes apart.<br>Play media<br><br>That&#39;s what you call box-office value for money.<br><br>Not that Aberdeen will be happy to have participated so well in such an entertaining spectacle.

Celtic are now unbeaten in their last 16 games with Aberdeen, and have scored 47 goals in those encounters.<br><br>However, few of those past meetings have been as dramatic as a stoppage-time overhead kick to seal a 4-3 comeback triumph.<br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>90:00 +4:00<br><br>Assist by Lassad Nouioui.<br>90:00 +5:17 Full time<br><br>Full Time The final whistle is blown by the referee.<br>90:00 +4:14 Booking<br><br>Booking Booking for Georgios Samaras for persistent infringement.<br>90:00 +4:00<br><br>The assist for the goal came from Efe Ambrose.<br>90:00 +4:00 Goal scored<br><br>Goal - Georgios Samaras - Celtic 4 - 3 Aberdeen Georgios Samaras finds the net with a fantastic goal from inside the box to the bottom left corner of the goal.

The march was organised by the Green Brigade, whose members claim they have been victims of police harassment and intimidation as a result of Scottish government legislation they say criminalises football fans.<br><br>Marchers began assembling outside the Chrystal Bell pub in the Gallowgate and several police fans were quickly on the scene. Men, women and children assembled, chanting &ldquo;Celtic fans against the bill&rdquo; as they set off to their destination at Celtic Park for the afternoon game against Aberdeen.<br><br>The procession marched up Watson Street and onto Bell Street, where it was then blocked by a line of police officers with support from a line of vans. There had been no visible signs of any violent conduct from any marcher, no disruption to public order, but marchers were told if they took a step further, they would be arrested.<br><br>One legal observer and advocate for civil rights &ndash; people who observe protest marches and assist anyone in need of legal representation &ndash; who wished to remain anonymous, told me: &ldquo;I had heard there was going to be a protest in the city by another organisation but it didn&rsquo;t happen, so I came over to have a look here instead.<br><br>&ldquo;This was extreme,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like that. I have never seen batons used on kids before, and I witnessed the Picadilly and London riots. I&rsquo;ve seen violent demonstrations, this was not that, they weren&rsquo;t even throwing anything, nothing.&rdquo;<br><br>Scuffles between marchers and police happened throughout Bell Street as marchers tried to move forward. Police threw marchers back into the crowd &ndash; some clearly young boys &ndash; one disabled child in a wheelchair was almost knocked over by the police line.<br><br>&ldquo;After the march started the police just cornered them and the vans kettled them. The marchers then tried to break through and the police got the batons out. I was elbowed into a car by the police as I tried to take photographs, they were just grabbing and pushing people.<br><br>&ldquo;I managed to get the name of one 14-year-old boy as he was arrested and had his head down in a puddle. I think they were taking advantage because those marchers weren&rsquo;t political protestors, they don&rsquo;t know their rights.<br><br>&ldquo;The police kettled them in under a bridge, it was just totally disproportionate. There was no public around that area to be disrupted and it was just outside of public view.&rdquo;<br><br>As the marchers were surrounded by police, reports were filtering through the crowds of several arrests being made. Marchers were told if they attempted to leave they would be arrested. Around eight police vans sat at the Bell Street side of the kettled marchers, with at least another eight gathered on the Gallowgate and several police cars scattered around the area. Police officers on horses then arrived to provide another reminder to marchers that they should not attempt to move. The police helicopter had been circling in the sky from the moment marchers began gathering.<br><br>I asked several of the police officers surrounding myself and the other marchers &ndash; estimates say around 200 attended, indicating for every one marcher there was a police officer &ndash; under what legislation the marchers were being held.<br><br>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t apply to march,&rdquo; one told me. &ldquo;They have to make an application to Glasgow City Council. We&rsquo;re here to prevent disruption. We&rsquo;re here for public order.&rdquo;<br><br>When I asked what indication the police had been given that this might be anything other than a peaceful march, he shrugged. None of the officers I spoke to named any legislation or indicated what had happened to necessitate was such a heavy police presence. &ldquo;We were just told to come here,&rdquo; another said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know any more than that.&rdquo;<br><br>While boxed in with the marchers, I witnessed no crowd violence. I saw a policeman pick one boy out and order him to remove his scarf from covering any of his face or he would be arrested. The boy did as he was told. As we waited to find out what the police planned to do with us, we could see marchers who had either tried to escape from the kettle or been in the surrounding area being arrested. I heard one report of a police officer being hit by a bottle but could not confirm it.<br><br>The police began allowing the marchers to leave in groups of two or three at certain intervals and from different parts of the group. As I described the scenes to a colleague on the phone, he asked me if I had my press card with me &ndash; as I responded and said the words &ldquo;press card&rdquo; out loud, the police immediately escorted me outside of the kettled group and told me I couldn&rsquo;t stand around.<br><br>I had no choice but to watch from afar as the rest of the group was dispersed. In total, the marchers managed to make it just yards away from where they had begun assembling at 12.30pm. As I left to find somewhere to write up my notes, I spoke to two men near the Chrystal Bell pub, the marchers&rsquo; meeting point, who had also witnessed the police using batons on marchers.<br><br>A spokeswoman for Strathclyde police said: &ldquo;At around 1pm, police were called to reports of a large number of people gathering outside the Chrystal Bell pub at Gallowgate, Glasgow. The crowd, many of whom were wearing similar hooded tops and using scarfs to hide their identities, appeared to be attempting to stage an illegal street procession and officers were deployed to prevent this.<br><br>&ldquo;The crowd were instructed that any procession on the road was illegal but that officers would facilitate a safe and orderly procession on the pavements toward their intended destination at Celtic Park. However, this was ignored and more officers were deployed as the crowd became increasingly confrontational and aggressive. The situation was contained a short time later.<br><br>&ldquo;In connection with the police operation at Gallowgate, Glasgow this afternoon, 13 people have been arrested so far in connection with alleged public order offences, and they are currently being processed. Police enquiries are continuing into the incident and officers will be studying CCTV and helicopter footage to gather further information.&rdquo;<br><br></div>
