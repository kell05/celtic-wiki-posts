However there is often a lot of intelligence in what he says at many times, and that at least puts him on a pedestal above many of his peers.   <br><br><ul>  <li>  <font color="#333333"><a class="external" href="http://media.putfile.com/Gordon-Strachan-interview--2-on-1-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Full interview BBC Scotland &quot;2 on1&quot; ">Full interview BBC Scotland &quot;2 on1&quot; </a></font>  </li><li>  <font color="#333333"><a href="/page/Gordon+Strachan+-++Cranston+Pickle" target="_self">Response from WGS: Letter to Cranston Pickle</a></font>   </li><li>  <font color="#333333"><a class="external" href="http://celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=748&Itemid=63" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Radio Clyde one interview (Dec 08)</a> [Highly recommended listening]</font></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pre-Celtic manager Quotes   </h3><b>Reporter</b>: Welcome to Southampton Football Club. Do you think you are the right man to turn things around?   <br><b>Strachan</b>: No. I was asked if I thought I was the right man for the job and I said, &quot;No, I think they should have got George Graham because I&#39;m useless.&quot;<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: Is that your best start to a season? <br><b>Strachan</b>: Well I&#39;ve still got a job so it&#39;s far better than the Coventry one, that&#39;s for sure.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: Are you getting where you want to be with this team? <br><b>Strachan</b>: We&#39;re not doing bad. What do you expect us to be like? We were eighth in the league last year, in the cup final and we got into Europe. I don&#39;t know where you expect me to get to. Do you expect us to win the Champions League?<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: Gordon, you must be delighted with that result? <br><b>Strachan</b>: You&#39;re spot on! You can read me like a book.<br><br><b>Strachan</b>: I&#39;ve got more important things to think about. I&#39;ve got a yogurt to finish by today, the expiry date is today. That can be my priority rather than Agustin Delgado.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: This might sound like a daft question, but you&#39;ll be happy to get your first win under your belt, won&#39;t you?<br><b>Strachan</b>: You&#39;re right. It is a daft question. I&#39;m not even going to bother answering that one. It is a daft question, you&#39;re spot on there.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: Bang, there goes your unbeaten run. Can you take it? <br><b>Strachan</b>: No, I&#39;m just going to crumble like a wreck. I&#39;ll go home, become an alcoholic and maybe jump off a bridge. Umm, I think I can take it, yeah.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: There&#39;s no negative vibes or negative feelings here? <br><b>Strachan</b>: Apart from yourself, we&#39;re all quite positive round here. I&#39;m going to whack you over the head with a big stick, down negative man, down.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: Where will Marion Pahars fit into the team line-up?<br><b>Strachan</b>: Not telling you! It&#39;s a secret.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: You don&#39;t take losing lightly, do you Gordon? <br><b>Strachan</b>: I don&#39;t take stupid comments lightly either.<br><br><b>Reporter</b>: So, Gordon, in what areas do you think Middlesbrough were better than you today? <br><b>Strachan</b>: What areas? Mainly that big green one out there...<br><br><b>Reporter: </b>Gordon, Do you think James Beattie deserves to be in the England squad?<br><b>Strachan: </b>I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m Scottish.<br><br><b>Reporter: </b>&quot;Gordon, can we have a quick word please?&quot;<br><b>Strachan: </b>&quot;Velocity&quot; [walks off]<br><br><b>Reporter: </b>Gordon, if you were English, what formation would you play? <br><b>Strachan</b>: If I was English I&#39;d kill myself! <b>...</b><br><br><b>On Chatshow with impressionist Alistair McGowan</b><br><b>Strachan: </b>&quot;If you can do Thierry Henry, I&#39;ll give you a game on Saturday.&quot;<br><br>&quot;If a Frenchman goes on about seagulls, trawlers and sardines, he&rsquo;s called a philosopher. I&rsquo;d just be called a short Scottish bum talking crap.&quot; <br><b><font color="#333333">Gordon Strachan</font> in response to Cantona&#39;s famous &quot;seagulls&quot; quote following the 1995 Crystal Palace-Simmons incident. </b><br><br>&quot;Its an incredible rise to stardom, at 17 you&#39;re more likely to get a call from Michael Jackson than Sven Goran Eriksson&quot;<br><b>WGS on Wayne Rooney</b><br><br>&quot;My bum has been through every temperature known to man.&quot;<br><b>Gordon Strachan (On heat treatment and ice-packs, 1993)</b><br><br><b>On Claus Lundekvam (Southampton) <br>Saints boss Gordon Strachan paid this glowing tribute to the one-paced Scandinavian in 2003:</b> <br>&ldquo;He was carried off at Leicester and someone asked me if he was unconscious. I didn&rsquo;t have a clue. That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s always like.&rdquo;<br><br>Strachan was on Sky on one Sunday morning(season 2005-06). He saw John Terry&#39;s goal and said he was impressed that Terry goes up expecting to score. He contrasted this to Claus Lundekvam the Saints central defender who goes up for every dead ball and never ever looks remotely like scoring. He said if there was a dead body lying in the penalty area the ball would hit it on the head several times a season which he said is more than Lundekvam can manage. He said referees should book Lundekvam for timewasting every time he goes up for a corner. When the co-commentator said if Lundekvam was watching Strachan was only joking. Strachan assured him he was deadly serious.<br><b>Strachan on Sky One(season 2005-06)</b><br><br>Although Strachan says he is first and foremost a coach, he hates the idea of a European-style system where players would be signed above his head. That happened during his tenure at Southampton when Rupert Lowe, below, the chairman, signed Antti Niemi against Strachan&#39;s wishes. Strachan recalled that Lowe backed up his view that managers were not the best judges of players by pointing out that farmer friends deemed him a good judge of cows and bulls. <br>Strachan&#39;s response? &quot;If we need a couple of cows to play up front for us, you are the man to see, eh?&quot; <br><b>Times Newspaper (Oct 2006)</b><br><br>&#39;The highlight for me, though, was when we got a roasting from Alex (Ferguson). There&#39;s a wee window in the dressing room - which is now in the toilet but used to be part of the main changing area. <br>&#39;We lost a late goal and Alex went berserk. He was kicking tables, sending sandwiches everywhere and, after his rant, there was a minute of quiet while we let him calm down. <br>&#39;Then, through that wee window a face appeared and it was Alex McLeish&#39;s wee brother. He stuck his nose to the glass and shouted: &quot;Alex, mum&#39;s asking are you coming home tonight or are you going back to Aberdeen on the bus?&#39;&#39;<br>&#39;Fergie raced at him and booted the window. That&#39;s the funniest story I have from Love Street.&#39;<br>It&#39;s a measure of how little Love Street has changed down the years that the window still exists. Even if, now, it serves a rather different function.<br>&#39;That window is part of the toilet now - people can look in on you. <br>&#39;You won&#39;t get stories like that in the future&#39;<br><b>WGS on Love Street (St Mirren&#39;s old stadium, Dec 2008)</b><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>WGS at Celtic (and Celtic related) - Quotes   </h3>  <h3>  Pre-Celtic</h3>It&#39;s always great fun getting attacked.

What you should ask is who is posing the question?

I&#39;m not answering a question from Mr Ned.&quot;<br><b>WGS on stress before the Champions League qualifiers (Aug 07)<br><br></b>Asked if changing the shape of the team was the one way in which he could surprise Spartak, he offered a characteristically sharp response: <br>&quot;Well, not if you and I keep talking about it.&quot;<br><b>WGS on tactics before the Champions League qualifiers (Aug 07)</b><br><br>&quot;Fans can be easily manipulated by you,(press) You can start wars you people , never mind going for managers &quot;<br><b>In reference to the press (Aug 07)</b><br><br><b>When asked about the challenge from Rangers, a question seldom heard after August, </b><br>&ldquo;I might start panicking tonight, take a drink and become an alcoholic, but the TV is alright tonight, so we should be OK.&rdquo;<br><b>WGS in Celtic Press Conference (24 Aug 07)</b><br><br>&quot;At Falkirk the other week, the police were asked to speak to me about smiling at the crowd,&quot; he said. &quot;Someone reported me for smiling in his direction.

They only play in front of parents and coaches and don&#39;t play on their own where they can learn from their own mistakes. If you&#39;re dribbling and get kicked on the shins you say to yourself it&#39;s about time I passed now, or your team mates will say &#39;Oi, greedy guts, give us a pass.&#39; That&#39;s the way to learn.&quot;<br><b>WGS on training kids in Football (taken from <a class="external" href="http://www.giveusbackourgame.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.giveusbackourgame.co.uk</a>)<br></b><br>&quot;It&#39;s embarrassing, I&#39;m not proud of it.

I can only consider myself fortunate not only to have worked with him on a daily basis for the past three years, but to have been able to count on him as a friend in that time. His bravery throughout his illness was an inspiration, and right to the end he was checking everyone else was OK, never giving a thought for himself or his situation.
