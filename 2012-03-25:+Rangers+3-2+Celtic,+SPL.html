With results going our way, we could wrap up the league title. Comically the teams came out to Simply The Best and union jacks galore. On the park, Celtic played v 12 men as the referee was a farce. Two men wrongly sent off (arguable at least) saw the team down to nine men which allowed the Huns to race to a three nil lead. A late penalty with a Hun sending off and then an injury time goal by Rogne gave ourselves more respectability, but 3-2 it finished. Lennon was sent to the stands then told to go to the media area as they couldn&#39;t ensure his safety there. A disgrace and surely a greater sign that Huns should be liquidated. Pathetic. Anyhow, it was a temporary reprieve for them and we had a lot still to look forward to. <br><br><i>(P&amp;P of KDS forum)</i><br>Absolutely shambolic performance from start to finish. A hallmark of  Celtic sides in recent seasons, it seems. We rack up at Ibrox time and  again and try to drive square pegs into round holes. Cha at right back?  Wildcard if ever there was to be one. Stokes up front on his own? Again,  why? The two goals makes it look respectable but I still can&#39;t accept  what the players and manager served up today.<br><br>Everyone frothed  before the match about how we&#39;d be shaky due to losing the cup final.  Rangers had lost three on the spin at home, and lost last week away.  Given that, we should have hit them like a train from the get go. As it  transpired, there was no pressing of the ball. No fifteen minute periods  where we got the ball down and kept it from them to settle into a  rhythm. Everything just looked disjointed and insipid. Each player had  an individual battle to fight and they all pretty much lost them, one by  one. I can take a defeat where we lose due a fantastic piece of skill.  Sure, Aluko&#39;s goal was excellent, and credit to him for the way he  finished. But all over the park they wanted it more. That&#39;s something I  can&#39;t accept - a Rangers team that wins an Old Firm game due to wanting  it more, and due to Celtic players&#39; stupidity. Wanyama, we&#39;re looking at  you.<br><br>Whilst it wasn&#39;t the deciding factor in the match, his  decision to send Cha off certainly influenced the game heavily, so  Murray gets some stick as well. The sending off itself was an absolute  nonsense. The guy&#39;s hand appears to come into some form of contact with  Wallace&#39;s shoulder. Is it a full on pull back or tug of the jersey?  Probably not. If it is, Wallace is held back. He doesn&#39;t fall forwards  to the deck. It&#39;s probably not a foul, and a booking at the very most.  An absolute disgrace of a decision. Wanyama&#39;s sending off is merited. He  lunges with two feet and is off the ground. We go on about referees  protecting players on this board. Murray did his job there. As regards  Bocanegra&#39;s red, I had fecked off upstairs by this point. On Cha&#39;s red,  though, it&#39;s a huge call. One he has to get right. He calls it badly,  badly wrong and ruins the game to an extent. Poor show.<br><br>Overall,  pretty pissy day. When we should have absolutely slapped them down in a  real mark of what dominance we&#39;re looking to begin to exert, we were  found embarassingly wanting by a midden of a team. We allowed them to  win that in many ways. Excellent. This jelly and ice cream can&#39;t come  out the fridge fast enough, Celtic. Don&#39;t keep us all waiting too long.  						 						 						 					<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>  <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Rangers</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>     01   McGregor              </li><li>     02   Goian              </li><li>     05   Papac              </li><li>     12   Wallace            (Kerkar - 78&#39;

For Ally McCoist and his players, it was perhaps far more significant that they avoided becoming the first team in Rangers&rsquo; 140-year existence to lose four successive games at Ibrox.<br><br>After two months submerged by the trauma of administration and the threat of liquidation, this was an afternoon of precious respite for everyone connected with the outgoing Scottish champions.<br><br>Neil Lennon left Govan stoked with a sense of injustice at the contribution of referee Calum Murray to the drama. He sent off two Celtic players, Cha Du Ri after just 28 minutes and Victor Wanyama 13 minutes into the second half. Lennon also received the managerial equivalent of a red card at half-time for his protests. By the time Rangers defender Carlos Bocanegra was dismissed in the 88th minute, the home side were 3-0 up and apparently cruising to their satisfying win through goals from Sone Aluko, Andrew Little and Lee Wallace.<br><br>But shortly after Scott Brown converted the penalty conceded by Bocanegra, Thomas Rogne headed home in stoppage time for the nine men to briefly hint at the unlikeliest of comebacks.<br><br>Rangers, who actually played their best football of the match when both sides had 11 men, deserved their victory. That it ended up being by such a narrow margin allowed the Celtic fans to temper their dismay at the outcome.<br><br>Even before his goal, Aluko was the brightest spark in a Rangers side who made by far the more dynamic start to the contest. Playing just off lone striker Lee McCulloch, the Nigerian winger gave the Celtic defence several uncomfortable moments.<br><br>Cha&rsquo;s difficult and ultimately shortened afternoon saw him cut out the first threat posed by Aluko, getting across to block his fourth minute shot at the expense of a corner. With most of their recognised first team regulars back from suspension or injury, there was a more solid and purposeful look to the home side than has been evident in recent weeks.<br><br>Rhys McCabe was the only one of the younger or fringe players to retain his place in McCoist&rsquo;s starting line-up and he did much to prove his inclusion was fully based on merit. The teenage midfielder performed with great assurance and no little ability in his first Old Firm fixture, appearing quite unruffled by the intensity of the occasion.<br><br>Looking to get on the ball as much as possible, McCabe was arguably the most effective player on the pitch for the first hour before he limped off to a standing ovation from the home support.<br><br>While McCabe had been influential in the general control Rangers exerted on the match, Aluko&rsquo;s 11th minute opener was very much his own work. Picking the ball up around 40 yards from goal, he embarked on a slaloming run which saw him flick the ball between Rogne&rsquo;s legs, then cut inside Charlie Mulgrew before steering a low right foot shot beyond Fraser Forster from around 14 yards.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s response was instant and only the excellence of Allan McGregor denied them a rapid equaliser. Georgios Samaras came close to netting a goal which would have matched Aluko&rsquo;s for individual brilliance, the big Greek forward beating three Rangers defenders in a surging run before his shot was blocked by McGregor, the goalkeeper also keeping out Anthony Stokes&rsquo; miscued follow-up effort.<br><br>Stokes then produced a far more impressive effort, collecting the ball on his chest on the right of the Rangers penalty area and turning to smash in a volley which McGregor managed to dive to his right to turn behind.<br><br>But Celtic could not sustain that momentum, Aluko getting Rangers back onto the front foot with a fine run and pass to the unmarked Wallace who should have done better than blaze his left foot shot over.<br><br>It was another charge forward from Wallace which prompted the first dismissal of the afternoon. Cha, caught on the wrong side of Wallace, pulled him back by the shoulder just outside the penalty area. Regarded as the denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity by Murray, the red card was duly produced.<br><br>Lennon, who sacrificed Stokes and sent on Emilio Izaguirre to reshuffle his 10 men, was incensed by the decision and others made by Murray which went against his team. He waited at the mouth of the tunnel at half-time to share his views with the officials and was excluded from the technical area for the rest of the day as a result.<br><br>He watched the second half on television in the media room and his view of proceedings would not have been enhanced by Wanyama&rsquo;s rashness which saw Celtic reduced to nine men in the 57th minute. The powerful Kenyan midfielder&rsquo;s two-footed challenge on Steven Whittaker saw him win the ball but his raised studs meant Murray reached for his red card once more.<br><br>Rangers replaced McCabe with Kyle Lafferty as they looked to take full advantage of the situation. The Northern Ireland forced a decent save from Forster shortly after entering the fray. The Celtic &lsquo;keeper also made a fine double save from McCulloch and Whittaker before Rangers finally increased their lead in the 73rd minute. Little, only on the pitch for around 30 seconds after replacing Aluko, netted the goal with his first touch. Forster saved from both McCulloch and Wallace but was beaten by Little&rsquo;s close range shot.<br><br>Suddenly, it looked as though Celtic could find themselves on the wrong end of heavy beating. That prospect increased when Wallace made it 3-0 for Rangers, dispossessing Adam Matthews in the centre circle and playing the ball to Steven Davis to spark a rapid counter attack. Wallace&rsquo;s supporting run was rewarded when he collected Davis&rsquo; return pass and slotted a low left foot shot under Forster.<br><br>Celtic might easily have settled for reaching full-time with no further damage inflicted at that stage. But they provided their fans behind McGregor&rsquo;s goal with a thrilling finale. Two minutes from the end of regulation time, Bocanegra calculatedly fouled Samaras inside the area just as the striker was about to shoot. It was a clear penalty and Bocanegra was sent off. Celtic captain Brown converted the spot-kick emphatically, beating McGregor to his left even though the &lsquo;keeper dived the right way.<br><br>In the second of four minutes of stoppage time, Celtic then threatened to pull off a remarkable recovery when Rogne rose to powerfully head home a Kris Commons free-kick from close range. They were unable to forage an equaliser but the full-time whistle was nonetheless greeted with a sense of celebration from both sets of fans on this most curious of Old Firm occasions.<br><br>RANGERS (3-5-1-1): McGregor, Goian, Bocanegra, Papac; Whittaker, McCabe (Lafferty 61), Davis, Edu, Wallace (Kerkar 78); Aluko (Little 72); McCulloch.

Photograph: Scott Heppell/AP<br><br>There was a surreal touch to this Old Firm encounter &ndash; Celtic supporters even cheered Rangers&#39; goals &ndash; but a familiar feeling too. Controversy lurks at these fixtures, almost as an ominous prerequisite. Neil Lennon launched a withering attack on the referee, Calum Murray, after seeing his Celtic side reduced to nine men in the 57th minute and enduring his own brush with officialdom.<br><br>Lennon essentially accused the match officials of collusion following a defeat by opponents who appeared to enjoy postponing their old adversaries&#39; title-winning party as much as they relished clinching the championship at Celtic Park in 1999. Lennon had waited to have words with Murray as the teams left the field at half-time and was subsequently told he would not be allowed to take his place in the dugout for the second period.<br><br>&quot;My sending off is a joke,&quot; said Celtic&#39;s manager. &quot;I spoke quite quietly and coldly to the referee in the tunnel. I didn&#39;t swear and didn&#39;t point any fingers. I told him I wasn&#39;t happy with his first-half performance. I&#39;ve got witnesses. I wanted to see him [the referee] after the game and I got a message back to wait 20 minutes later then I could go and see him. Twenty minutes later he wouldn&#39;t see me. I was speaking to the match delegate after the game and their version of events are different from mine. I&#39;ve got witnesses to back me up.<br><br>&quot;I do my team talk at half-time, I walk back out and got called into the referee&#39;s room. I have been deprived of doing my job properly when my team needed me. I am very angry about that.&quot; It merely added to Lennon&#39;s ire that he was unable to take a seat in the Ibrox main stand on security advice. Instead, he watched the closing 45 minutes on a television monitor in the media room. &quot;That just sums things up in this country,&quot; Lennon said.<br><br>&quot;The biggest game of the season and I can&#39;t go out in the stand to watch my team or send down messages. I have Stevie Woods [goalkeeping coach] at the door and he was running up and down the tunnel for me. I might as well have sat in the house and watched the second half.<br><br>&quot;When you are down to nine men, it is an uphill task. This is not the first time we have come to Ibrox and had players sent off for little or nothing.&quot;<br><br>This affair promises to rumble on. Still, what Lennon should not ignore is that too many of his players underperformed on the big occasion. Celtic had travelled to Ibrox looking for the victory which would secure the Scottish Premier League championship but left wounded; their own shortcomings, added to Rangers&#39; dynamic showing, are worthy of more focus than Lennon would publicly prefer.<br><br>The hosts took supreme delight in winning the only match in this troubled denouement to their season that they care about. For the first time in Lennon&#39;s tenure, Celtic have lost back-to-back domestic matches. It would be a pity if Celtic, who have obviously been the superior side in Scotland in this campaign, crawl over the SPL finishing line.<br><br>Glasgow derbies never resemble tea parties but the pre-match scene was quite something. The Rangers support, who excel in defiance, offered something akin to the last stand of the British empire. And what a din they created in doing so.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s contingent, as was the case even after the result was decided, vociferously pointed out exactly where the SPL trophy will be housed sooner or later. Still, the intense sentiment attached to the Old Firm means those in green and white could only attempt to mask the hurt associated with derby defeat.<br><br>Sone Aluko, who excelled for Rangers, claimed a terrific opening goal. The Nigerian nutmegged Thomas Rogne and skipped past Charlie Mulgrew before offering a low, near-post finish.<br><br>That at least roused Celtic into something resembling an attacking force for a brief period. Georgios Samaras stung the palms of the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor before Anthony Stokes wasted a fine chance with the rebound. Stokes was similarly profligate with a back-post header after 27 minutes.<br><br>Just 120 seconds later, Celtic had been reduced to 10 men. Cha Du-ri clearly pulled back Lee Wallace, 19 yards from goal, as the midfielder sought to collect an Aluko pass. The fairest assessment of the incident arrived from the Rangers manager, Ally McCoist.<br><br>&quot;Did he prevent a goalscoring opportunity? Probably. Was it a soft sending off? Probably,&quot; said McCoist. Murray will maintain the dismissal was correct by the letter of the law and not unreasonably so. In such situations, referees are hamstrung by rules rather than blessed with common sense.<br><br>What is beyond dispute is that Cha&#39;s exit doused any sentiment that Celtic could claw themselves back into the proceedings. Lennon was clear on whom he blamed for that, branding a subsequent decision not to hand Samaras a free-kick as a &quot;joke&quot; to anyone with an even basic command of lip reading.<br><br>Victor Wanyama became the second Celtic player to have his afternoon cut short, 12 minutes after the interval. The midfielder has little defence after challenging Steven Whittaker with two feet, although McCoist once again was reasonable. &quot;Did he set out to harm the player?&quot; asked the Rangers manager. &quot;Definitely not, in my opinion.&quot;<br><br>From there, the burning question was whether McCoist&#39;s men had the ruthlessness required to capitalise on a numerical advantage. Answers arrived from Andrew Little, who slammed home at close range, and Wallace, who met a Steven Davis pass before offering a low finish.<br><br>By that juncture, Celtic&#39;s fans had written the encounter off more than their players had. With two minutes remaining, Carlos Bocanegra upended Samaras inside the penalty area to prompt another flash of red from Murray. Scott Brown dispatched the penalty with Rogne heading a Celtic second past McGregor in stoppage time.<br><br>&quot;If you want me to talk about the referee, I will, but in the grand picture we won the game and deserved to win,&quot; added McCoist.<br><br>That much may be true, but discussion in the coming days will surround altogether different issues. The more things change, and all that.<br><br>Man of the match Sone Aluko (Rangers)  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br>By Clive Lindsay BBC Scotland<br><br>Reigning champions Rangers prevented the Scottish title being won on their own patch despite a dramatic late rally from nine-man runaway leaders Celtic.<br><br>Sone Aluko opened the scoring after a mazy, 10th-minute run into the box.<br><br>Cha Du-Ri was sent off after 29 minutes, Victor Wanyama followed 12 minutes after the break and Andy Little and Lee Wallace slotted further goals.<br><br>Celtic captain Scott Brown scored a penalty after Carlos Bocanegra was sent off - then Thomas Rogne headed home.<br><br>The two late goals - the latter in stoppage time - could not prevent a Rangers victory that Celtic manager Neil Lennon watched from the media room having been banned from the dugout for the second half by the referee.<br><br>It was a loss that ended the visitors&#39; 21-game unbeaten run in the league.<br><br>The scene had been set for Celtic as they looked to recover from last week&#39;s defeat in the Scottish Communities League Cup final by claiming their 43rd league title.<br><br>A 100th league win over Rangers would have seen Celtic beat the previous earliest date for clinching the title - 4 April - two years to the day since Neil Lennon took over as manager from Tony Mowbray.<br><br>Ally McCoist, his squad depleted by the club&#39;s entry into administration, was hoping to avoid being the first Rangers manager to oversee four successive home defeats and the first to concede the title to Celtic at Ibrox since 1967 and made five changes to the team that lost to Dundee United last weekend.<br><br>With Gary Hooper and James Forrest not fit enough to start, and Kelvin Wilson also dropping out, Lennon was forced into changes too, with Cha, Georgios Samaras and Ki Sung-Yeung coming in as Celtic matched Rangers&#39; five in midfield.<br><br>But Rangers&#39; bright start was soon rewarded when Aluko picked the ball up 30 yards from goal and weaved through a group of Celtic players, nutmegging Rogne and sidestepping Charlie Mulgrew in the process, before slipping the ball under goalkeeper Fraser Forster for a superb individual goal.<br><br>Celtic responded and Samaras almost surpassed Aluko with a run from midway inside his own half, jinking past four Rangers players before having his 12-yard drive pushed clear by goalkeeper Allan McGregor.<br><br>Anthony Stokes failed to connect properly with the rebound and the ball bounced on to the top of the crossbar before the Irishman forced McGregor to turn it wide at full-stretch with a 15-yard shot on the turn.<br><br>Aluko found Wallace in space charging into the Celtic box and, although the full-back fired over, it was a similar move that led to Cha&#39;s dismissal soon after when he pulled back the full-back on the edge of the box.<br>Use accessible player and disable flyout menus<br><br>An angry Lennon, a frequently animated presence on the touchline in the first half, had words with referee Calum Murray at the interval and subsequently did not reappear after the break.<br><br>Matters then boiled over on the pitch as Wanyama was sent off for a two-footed challenge on Whittaker.<br><br>Fine blocks by Forster denied Kyle Lafferty, McCulloch and Whittaker, but after the goalkeeper saved from Wallace at point-blank range on 77 minutes, Little was on hand to score with his first touch after coming off the bench.<br>Use accessible player and disable flyout menus<br><br>Wallace slotted under Forster after being set up by Davis on the break five minutes later, but Celtic almost staged an amazing escape act when Bocanegra was sent off for pulling down Samaras with a minute of normal time remaining.<br><br>Brown coolly slotted the penalty and Rogne headed in at the back post in stoppage time, but it was not enough to deny Rangers a win that salvages some bruised pride and delays Celtic&#39;s celebrations at least another week.  <br><br><br>  Live Text Commentary<br>90:00 +4:03<br><br>The final whistle goes and the game is over.<br>90:00 +3:11<br><br>Allan McGregor takes the free kick.<br>90:00 +3:11 Substitution<br><br>Substitution Gary Hooper replaces Joe Ledley.<br>90:00 +3:11<br><br>Steven Whittaker fouled by Georgios Samaras, the ref awards a free kick.<br>90:00 +1:54<br><br>Kris Commons provided the assist for the goal.<br>90:00 +1:54 Goal scored<br><br>Goal - Thomas Rogne - Rangers 3 - 2 Celtic Thomas Rogne finds the back of the net with a headed goal from deep inside the penalty area.

The other arrests were for drink- related offences, assault and breach of the peace.<br><br>Police had appealed for fans and officials of Celtic and Rangers to behave ahead of the match, which was described as &ldquo;unique&rdquo; because of Rangers&rsquo; position in administration and Celtic&rsquo;s opportunity to secure the league if they won the match.<br><br>Rangers won the match 3-2 and three players &ndash; Cha Du-Ri and Victor Wanyama for Celtic and Carlos Bocanegra for Rangers &ndash; were sent off by the referee.<br><br>Lennon expressed anger after the game. He said: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sit in the stand for my own safety &ndash; which sums things up in this country. I watched the second half in the press room.<br><br>&ldquo;The biggest game of the season and I can&rsquo;t go out into the stand to watch my team, send down messages.&rdquo;<br><br>He added: &ldquo;I might as well have sat in the house and watched.<br><br>&ldquo;Security advised me not to go into the stand. I would have been happy to go out, but I was told that, for my own safety, it wasn&rsquo;t a good idea.&rdquo;<br><br>The scenes at Ibrox yesterday &ndash; with Rangers boss Ally McCoist shaking hands with Celtic players at the end of the game &ndash; were a far cry from the incidents that prompted the Scottish Government to call an emergency summit and introduce legislation to tackle offensive behaviour.<br><br>In March last year, ugly scenes erupted, including a dug-out brawl between McCoist and Lennon, which overshadowed Celtic&rsquo;s Scottish Cup victory.<br><br>Match commander Chief Superintendent Andy Bates said last week that the police operation around the game would be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo;.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a fairly significant presence on the ground across the whole of the west of Scotland. Every area will have an increase in police officers both during the game and well into the evening.&rdquo;<br><br>It was the first Old Firm game since the introduction of the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications Act 2012, which came into force on 1 March.<br><br>The law gives police and prosecutors tools to crack down on sectarian songs and abuse at and around football matches, as well as threats posted on the internet or through the mail.<br><br>The act created two offences, punishable by a range of penalties up to a maximum five years in prison and an unlimited fine.<br><br>The first targets &ldquo;hateful, threatening or otherwise offensive behaviour&rdquo;, expressed at and around football matches, which is likely to cause public disorder.<br><br>Two men were fined and banned from football for a year in the first conviction under the new law earlier this month.<br><br>Mr Bates said: &ldquo;I believe the new legislation brings a bit of clarity to what is offensive behaviour and what fans can and can&rsquo;t do at football games and we&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time communicating that and I think there is more clarity now.<br><br>&ldquo;In terms of policing there is little difference &ndash; if people breach the law they stand a good chance of being arrested.&rdquo;  <br></div></div>
