As Bangura put it himself: <br><br><blockquote><i>&quot;To come to   Celtic gives me a good feeling because it&#39;s another step  in my career. I   have to work to get to the top. I&#39;m talking about the  Spanish league,   the English league or maybe the Italian league. If  I can do my best   here with Celtic then I will see what the future  holds. If possible, I   could make the next step in one year - if  everything goes well and the   club is willing, why not?&quot;</i><i><br><br></i></blockquote>How wrong he was to <span class="diffRemove">be...</span><span class="diffAdd">be.</span><br><br>He   was given ample opportunities in the first and reserve sides, and in   neither did he show his worth. After sixteen appearances for the first   team (admittedly a number from off the bench), he had the miserly record   of zero goals and just the one assist. The fact we have to list his   &#39;assist&#39; to give him any kind of <span class="diffRemove">record</span><span class="diffAdd">credit</span> speaks for itself. His shooting   and positioning was woeful.  <br><br>In one game he near enough hit the   cornerflag three times with shots and chased a guy who was about to be   substituted. Ridiculous!<br><br>He was just out of his depth, and this   was the SPL. Yet he and his agent were talking about the big leagues  on  his arrival. It would be laughable if it wasn&#39;t for the fact we were   lumped with him. The only thing that entertained the fans was his  little  dance with some colleagues round the SPL trophy in our league  title  celebrations.<br><br>In August 2012 after just one appearance in  the  league in the new season (another hapless display) he was shipped  back  to Sweden to AIK Stockholm on loan till Dec 2012. Hopefully this  would  give him back some confidence to reboot his career. <br><br>It  was said<span class="diffRemove">  we&#39;d</span><span class="diffAdd"> that Celtic had</span> paid &pound;2.2m for him. That is very unlikely, and we hope  it&#39;s not  true. Henrik Larsson is said to have recommended him to Celtic,  and for the  first (and only time) he&#39;d let the club unintentionally down (but we forgive  Larsson).<br><br>   Bangura should have not made public such haughty  ambitions on his  arrival. It&#39;s no shock that into the longer term all  players wish to  play at the highest level. However, Bangura hadn&#39;t even  got off the  starting blocks and should have been a bit more reticent.  It was  disrespectful (especially the one year target) and when things  went wrong,  there was only lampooning and no sympathy. There has  probably not been  at Celtic such a yawning gap between a player&#39;s  self-belief and the  reality as occurred with him.<br><br>  There were no Celtic supporters  sad to see him move on loan for footballing  reasons but in fairness  there were no personal issues against him. The  initial boast was in  retrospect just stupid &amp; naive and he was no  &#39;<i>misfit</i>&#39; as one tabloid  dubbed him.<br><br>The question became of what was to happen on his return after the end of the loan move? <br><br><b>The Elfsborg debacle<br></b>AIK  opted not to loan him back again (too expensive) and it was  thought  Celtic were stuck with him. He finally scored a goal for the  first team  against Steaua Bucharest albeit in a friendly, and it was clearly met  with much relief by him as well as humour/applause from the  support.  Despite the post-match soundbites of hoping for more chances along with  more goals to come etc, he ended up being packed off back to Sweden for   another loan, this time to Elfsborg.<br><br>  If things weren&#39;t hard  enough for Bangura, things were to take a curious turn of fate. <br><br>In  the  summer of 2013, Celtic were in the qualifying rounds of the  Champions  League and in the third round we were drawn against Elfsborg,  then  hosting Bangura as a loan player. Uefa regulations didn&#39;t  prohibit  Bangura from playing against his old side, despite Lennon  stating and  warning that it wasn&#39;t in his interest to do so. Elfsborg  retorted, but  it was all just mind games. Not a pleasant situation for  Bangura, with a  media minder having to accompany him butting in  repeatedly whenever  questions were asked to him. You had to actually  sympathise with him, the new conundrum was an ill-fated situation.<br><br>In  any case, Bangura played both  games but didn&#39;t score against his  parent club, so his dismal record  continued. However, he actually  played well in both games, setting up a  good chance for a team mate in  the first leg and in the second leg he  had the measure of his Celtic  marker (Ambrose). He actually squandered  two gilt edged chances in the  second leg much to Celtic&#39;s relief. All  Celtic fans were thankful he  didn&#39;t take his chance to upstage us with a goal  but his performances  meant he could hold his head a little higher than  before, yet he was  still in the red in accomplishments.<br><br>Notably  he was loudly booed  each time he touched the ball by Celtic supporters  in those Elfsborg  matches, due to that he was on paper a Celtic squad player attempting to  knock Celtic out. In  fairness, as he was loaned out then his duty is  correctly to his hosts,  so Bangura was correct in his efforts and  respect to him for that, but  the booing helped to put him off in the  matches (would happen with any  set of supporters in a similar  situation). To some, Bangura seemed  disloyal but that&#39;s just nonsense, as  if the boot was on the other  foot, the Celtic supporters would want the player to play to  his best regardless of the  opposition. Saying that, his antics on the field included one instance  that saw him clutch his face in an act of &quot;<i>simulation</i>&quot; (i.e. cheating),  and watching any paid professional rolling about the floor is embarrassing to say the least to watch,  so little sympathy here.<br><br>In any case, things at Elfsborg  were  declining for him as well, and he was even roundly booed at   Elfsborg by their own fans at their last league match before the second   leg  against Celtic as their side floundered domestically. Bangura was  in a hole.  Shambles of a situation.<br><br><b>Return &amp; departure from Celtic<br></b>On his  return to Celtic, with his loan clubs not taking up options to  keep  him, he was in a gaping hole of his own making. Lennon made public that   Bangua could move on despite 18 months of his contract left. The first   team had a number of misfiring strikers on the books and even then he  was not being given another  chance.<br><br>Mo Bangura verbally agreed to end his Celtic contract early and was released on 31 Jan 2014.

Celtic are a step forward for me,and  this was the right time for  me to make the move.&rdquo;<br><br>Bangura will  join up with the Celtic squad  after the international break, which will  see Sierra Leone take on South  Africa next Tuesday,and he is  determined to win a place in the starting  XI.<br><br>It will be the striker&rsquo;s first time in Scotland and he is hoping to make an instant impact.<br><br>&ldquo;I   will be over soon but first I have to play for my country,&quot; he said.   &quot;From there I&#39;ll go straight to Scotland and join up with Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;I feel good.

I saw people dying around me and I remember the tears shed.<br><br>&ldquo;I   was in Sierra Leone when all the fighting was going on and I am so   lucky that I wasn&rsquo;t killed. I still cannot explain why I didn&rsquo;t lose my   life during that spell. I can only assume that God chose to guide me.<br><br>&ldquo;I   can never say that I felt everything was going to be all right. I am   just so happy that everything is good now and that things are working   out for me in my adult life.<br><br>&ldquo;I also have the opportunity to play   for my country these days and it makes me incredibly proud to  represent  the modern Sierra Leone. I am so happy that I cannot stop  smiling  because I sense Celtic and the SPL will suit me.&rdquo;<br><br>Bangura  has  paid a tribute to former Rangers player Alex Miller for helping  him come  through another tough spell in his life when his new-born son  died last  October.<br><br>Miller was in charge at Stockholm when the  tragedy  happened and gave his player extended compassionate leave &ndash;  even though  it adversely affected his side&rsquo;s battle against relegation.  Bangura  said: &ldquo;I really liked Alex and he believed in me.&rdquo;<br><br>Meanwhile,  the  player, who was signed after Celtic legend Henrik Larsson gave  former  team-mate Neil Lennon a glowing commendation, has vowed to bang  in the  goals for his new club.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;I want to bring joy to  the  team, and I want to bring joy to myself.

He said: &ldquo;I am told fans loved   Henrik&rsquo;s style so I am going to grow my dreadlocks back.&rdquo;<br><br>Bangura   is delighted that he will have the opportunity to play in the  Champions  League at Celtic in the future and has also spoken of his  desire to one  day play in the Barclays Premier League.<br><br>He said:  &ldquo;Naturally,  the possibility of playing in the Champions League is a big  thing. It is  where everyone involved in professional football wants to  be.<br><br>&ldquo;I am sure I can help the team do what it needs to get the title and get back into Europe at that level.<br><br>&ldquo;My   career goal is to get into one of the biggest leagues in the world at   some point such as the English Premier League.

I feel good. I&rsquo;ve played in Europe for a while now  and so  I feel ready.

But Celtic&acute;s 2-1 victory over Steaua   Bucharest in Marbella  turned out to hold far greater significance for   Mo Bangura.<br><br>The  striker ended 18 months of frustrationin the53rd   minute of the  matchby bagging his first top-team goal for the Hoops,   clinically  heading home from Kris Commons&acute; cross.<br><br>His effort   also completed  the Scottish champions&acute; fight-back against the Romanian   league leaders  after Georgios Samaras had cancelled out Stefan   Nikolici&acute;s early strike.<br><br>It was a joyful moment for Bangura and also one of immense relief. A huge weight was instantly lifted off his shoulders.<br><br>Several    injuries and the fierce competition for places in the attacking    department had hindered the Sierra Leonean internationalist&acute;s progress    in Paradise since his arrival in August 2011. <br><br>That saw him to    head out on loan during the first half of the season to former side  AIK,   where he earned some valuable game-time and rediscovered his  scoring   touch.<br><br>He returned to Celtic with confidence restored  and   determined to prove his worth. Breaking his goalscoring duck has  further   fuelled Bangura&acute;s self-belief levels and he&acute;s now eager to  make his   mark at the club.<br><br>&quot;I don&acute;t know even know how to  explain myself   as I feel really great and happy,&quot; he told the official  Celtic website   in an exclusive interview. &quot;I have to say thanks to  everyone &ndash; my   team-mates and the coaches who have given me a chance,  as this what I   need. Hopefully, I will get some more.<br><br>&quot;I need  to score goals as   this gives me confidence and now I need to play more  games. This is why   I went on loan as I was injured and then when I  came back I needed   matches. So I went and scored a couple of goals and  got my belief back.<br><br>&quot;I   am delighted to be back and score my  first goal for Celtic. It was  good  for me.It was a good cross from  Kris Commons and I just managed to  head  it down into the far corner. <br><br>&quot;I now have to fight to be in the team, to get chances and hopefully bang in some more goals.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div>
