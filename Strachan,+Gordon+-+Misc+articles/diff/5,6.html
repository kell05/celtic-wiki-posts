But, manager of Celtic, in seconds it&#39;s &#39;yes&#39; and that&#39;s it. <br>  <br>&quot;They are a world famous club and you cannot turn down that chance to perform as a manager here and in a stadium as fantastic as this. It&#39;s a thing I just couldn&#39;t turn down. <br>  <br>&quot;I do feel invigorated. I said when I stopped at Southampton, the next job I want is something exciting and this definitely had it. Even the wife could tell I was really excited about this job. <br>  <br> &quot;You know it when somebody asks you if it&#39;s going to be theright job for you. <br>  <br>&quot;It&#39;s a surreal thing with me and Martin. We spoke a lot on the phone and were together again last night with the coaching staff and had a great time. I was telling Fergie stories and he was telling Cloughie stories. He won on his stories but I&#39;m sure I can exaggerate mine as the years go by. <br>  <br>&quot;I&#39;m proud to be asked to take this hard job to take over from Martin. Five years ago, it was maybe too much for me butnow I know it&#39;s not too much for me and I&#39;m lookingforward to it.&quot; <br>  <br> Strachan was asked about his approach to management. <br>  <br>&quot;Anything to do with players, I like. The rest is hard work. I like dealing with the players and I&#39;ve got a big enough back-up staff to handle that. <br>  <br> &quot;[Watching them] I reaffirmed some beliefs I had anyway. I could be more analytical about the games I watched. <br>  <br>&quot;I&#39;ve been around the world watching football fitness techniques. It&#39;s quite simple really. Have a good formation to stop you losing goals then get good players to win games. It&#39;s as simple as that, not as cosmic as coaches make out. <br>  <br>&quot;They are actually giving themselves a pat on the back when their tactics are spot on but, when they lose, it&#39;s the players who are terrible. <br>  <br>&quot;When I left Southampton, I think people thought I wanted a better job than Southampton but I wanted something different. We&#39;re right in there with different now. <br>  <br> &quot;I know what I&#39;m letting myself in for. It still doesn&#39;t deter me nor make me less excited. <br>  <br> &quot;It&#39;s a magnificent challenge, a magnificent club with good people. It&#39;s a fantastic opportunity to become a better manager. <br>  <br>&quot;Gary Pendry is to come along with me, he&#39;s been with me for eight years and will be my assistant. The rest of it is not a problem as I don&#39;t have to take a lot of people around with me. I&#39;m quite happy to meet new people and they might just give me some new ideas too. <br>  <br> &quot;My target is just to win. We have to win every game, all the time, friendlies and everything. <br>  <br> &quot;It&#39;s a different mentality you&#39;ve got when you come to this club and I have to get used to that myself. <br>  <br> &quot;If I said last week, let&#39;s forget about how you play, let&#39;s win, they [the fans] would have accepted that. <br>  <br> &quot;We&#39;ll try to make players as individuals and as a group better but we must win. <br>  <br>&quot;I don&#39;t sit here thinking I hope everybody likes me. My responsibility is to the players, to get them working well, everyone else will follow. <br>  <br>&quot;I can&#39;t worry every day if I&#39;ve upset a fan or anything like that. There will be days when they like me and days when they don&#39;t. <br>  <br>&quot;But they&#39;ve got to remember they will only dislike me for the decisions I make sometimes, hopefully they will stay on a level keel with me as a person.&quot;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%">  <a href="/page/Strachan%2C+Gordon+-+Resignation+%26+Departure+%28articles%29" target="_self"><br></a></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Strachan given rousing send-off at Burns tribute</h3>  <div class="Provided">  <div>  01 June 2009</div>Provided by: The Times</div>  <div class="LeadPara"> Gordon Strachan finally took his leave of Celtic yesterday and was given a rousing send-off by 35,000 supporters as the departing manager basked in a slice of public gratitude that was as warm as the Glasgow sun.</div>  <div class="LeadPara"> An emotional Strachan took to the pitch before the Tommy Burns Tribute Match and spoke to the Celtic Park crowd about his decision last Monday to quit the club after four successful years in charge, in which he won six honours, including three successive Clydesdale Bank Premier League titles.</div>  <div class="TailParas"> While some Celtic fans never took to Strachan, those who turned out for an occasion that will hopefully raise over &pound;300,000 for the widow and family of Burns, who died a year ago from skin cancer, gave praise that echoed to the rafters.</div>  <div class="TailParas"> &quot;When I first joined the club, I didn&#39;t want to kid people on that I was a Celtic supporter, I didn&#39;t want to kiss the badge,&quot; Strachan said. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to be disrespectful to the fans. I had been told you were the best supporters in the world &mdash; and after four years here I now know you are the best in the world. I also want to thank the board for their support. Contrary to what you might be hearing or reading the directors are doing their very best to make sure the club is successful and thriving.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas"> Strachan was deeply affected by the death of Burns, the former Celtic player and manager who became Strachan&#39;s first-team coach. &quot;The unexpected bonus in coming to Celtic was that I met the nicest man I have ever met in my life,&quot; he said. &quot;Without him my life would not be as fulfilled and certainly I could not have been as successful here as manager.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas"> The match between the Celtic first team and a side of former players, most of whom were managed by Burns in the mid-1990s &mdash; including Paolo Di Canio, Pierre van Hooijdonk and Roy Keane, mentioned as a possible contender for the managerial vacancy &mdash; ended in an 11-4 success for Strachan&#39;s men.</div>  <div class="TailParas"> Neil Lennon, the former club captain who assumed Burns&#39;s role as first-team coach, has been told by the board that he will remain in his post, whoever succeeds Strachan. &quot;Peter Lawwell [the chief executive] has told me that I&#39;ll be here &mdash; and I&#39;ll be there to assist the new guy in any way I can,&quot; Lennon, who has been linked with the vacancy at Hibernian, said.</div>  <div class="TailParas"> &quot;The club are looking for a new manager and, hopefully, he will be the manager for a long time. We just need the fans to be patient.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas"> Billy McNeill, the captain of the Celtic&#39;s European Cup-winning team, and a manager in two spells at the club, agreed: &quot;It is more important to get the right man than to do it quickly. I would have preferred Gordon to stay on but it was good to see the crowd give him such a reception.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">  (c) 2009 Times Newspapers Limited.

I didn&rsquo;t want to tell you I was a Celtic supporter as a kid, I didn&rsquo;t want to kiss badges and I didn&rsquo;t know the words to the Fields of Athenry.<br><br>&ldquo;I wanted to earn the respect and vice versa, I wanted to see if you really were the best supporters in the world. From those four years, I found out that you are the best supporters in the world.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank the supporters who I met personally, the real ones who I touched. They helped through the tough times and made it far easier for my family. I&rsquo;ll always remember that.<br><br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t kid you on that I could ever feel like a Celtic supporter when I was the manager because I couldn&rsquo;t. I really couldn&rsquo;t tell you what it feels like to watch Rangers win nine-in-a-row.<br><br>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t tell you what it feels like to go to some awful grounds, where you are penned into a corner and the price of everything goes up when you go there. I don&rsquo;t know what that feels like.<br><br>&ldquo;But from today, I will start to feel it because I&rsquo;m going to have to start paying my way from now on. From today, I&rsquo;ve become a Celtic supporter.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to thank everybody at Celtic. The players were magnificent to work with and I&rsquo;d like to thank the board. They have been magnificent and they are doing everything they can to help the club be successful. They were fantastic to me.<br><br>&ldquo;If I could sum it all up like this &ndash; since I started out in football at 15, every decision I made, and some have been bad, I wouldn&rsquo;t change it for the world. Because if I changed one of those decisions, I would not have been the Celtic manager and that would be hard. Thank you.&rdquo;<br><br>Fittingly, the ex-Celtic boss also reserved a special word for his close friend Tommy Burns.

It did not exist when I was the manager.<br><br>&quot;I may  have felt there was one referee who didn&#39;t like me very much but that  was more about a clash of personalities rather than something sinister.<br><br>&quot;And I actually found it funny when the Celtic fans chanted &#39;That&#39;s why we are paranoid&#39;. That was a good laugh.<br><br>&quot;But when I was manager I don&#39;t think there was anything untoward going on.<br><br>&quot;Celtic have won millions of trophies and they will keep on doing it.&quot;<br><br>Strachan admits to being surprised at the extent of the divide that has now opened up between Celtic and the SFA.<br><br>The  relationship began to deteriorate shortly after he was replaced by Tony  Mowbray and it reached breaking point after the infamous Dougie-gate  scandal at Tannadice in October last year .<br><br>Strachan said: &quot;It surprised me to see how quickly things deteriorated between the club and the referees since I was there.<br><br>&quot;It seemed to become a huge issue overnight.<br><br>&quot;I  only saw it from afar. I wasn&#39;t in the thick of it. But I do know this,  that atmosphere of suspicion and of pandering to the lowest common  denominator is very unhealthy for the game.<br><br>&quot;The climate we live  in up there can be a horrible one and accusations tend to fly around all  over the place, whether it&#39;s bigotry, racism or sexism.<br><br>&quot;It can all be used as a weapon against people as we have seen recently with Richard Keys and Andy Gray.<br><br>&quot;In Scotland you really need to watch all that stuff.<br><br>&quot;If  I could advise people there I would say, &#39;Let&#39;s just put it all to bed  now before things get out of hand.

He had become his own biggest casualty.<br><br>With  his pride in tatters and his reputation dented, Strachan headed to his  favourite retreat in La Manga, Spain to begin the healing process.<br><br>In accordance with the usual managerial protocol, it started off with a prolonged period of painful and deep self analysis.<br><br>Along with those dark thoughts of doubt, Strachan asked himself some searching questions. You know the type of thing.<br><br>Where did it all go wrong? Why didn&rsquo;t I see it coming? Why the hell did I leave Celtic in the first place?<br><br>That last one gnawed away at him more than all the others until it had buried itself deep in his mind.<br><br>But  it was only when he picked up a copy of the Daily Record to read about  Scottish football ripping itself to shreds that he was able to answer  his own question.<br><br>There was a very good reason why he did not wish to be involved in our game any longer &ndash; it had turned rancid.<br><br>The  conspiracy theorists had taken over. The referees were out on the  cobbles. The Roman Catholic church was calling for Hugh Dallas&rsquo;s head  over an email.<br><br>And Strachan&rsquo;s old club was caught up in the thick of it.<br><br>Suddenly, sitting on his sunbed, the penny dropped.<br><br>&ldquo;Oh  yeah, THAT&rsquo;S why I left!&rdquo; Strachan smiles as he recalls those frenzied  few weeks from October until November of last year when, at his lowest  ebb, at least he found comfort from knowing he was no longer dirtying  his hands with the poisonous side of life in the SPL pond.<br><br>&ldquo;Do I miss it? Yes I do. Bits and bobs of it anyway.<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  get me wrong, it was a magnificent job and a fantastic club. But I  remember being in La Manga, thinking to myself, &lsquo;Why did I ever leave  Celtic? Did I go too soon?&rsquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Then I picked up the paper and read  about the battles with the SFA and the refs going on strike. I just  couldn&rsquo;t work in that kind of environment again.&rdquo;<br><br>Strachan, of course, handled it better than most. His first three seasons at Celtic saw him bag three successive league titles.<br><br>He  was the first manager since the late, great Jock Stein to bring such a  sustained period of domestic dominance to the East End of Glasgow.<br><br>And  yet, even though the trophies were coming thick and fast, Strachan  began to wonder if he was winning on a level playing field.<br><br>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know if I was guilty of being a bit paranoid during my time there,  maybe I was,&rdquo; Strachan admits as he reflects on his own experiences at  the helm. &ldquo;But I always held my own counsel even if I did feel that  everyone was against me.<br><br>&ldquo;The key thing is that this is not something specific to Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;I  felt that way as a player at Aberdeen because Alex Ferguson told us  everybody was against us. He created a siege mentality and it worked.<br><br>&ldquo;But  as you get a bit older you learn not to buy into that any more. It  doesn&rsquo;t motivate you the way it used to because you know it&rsquo;s simply not  true.<br><br>&ldquo;But yes, there were times when I was Celtic manager when I  got a wee bit daft like that myself. I asked myself, &lsquo;Is everybody  really against us?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s because I was listening to too much of what  was going on around me.<br><br>&ldquo;There were people inside the club who  believed it and fans who said the same thing. Remember, I have Celtic  fans as relatives &ndash; you might have noticed!<br><br>&ldquo;So it can be easy to  allow yourself to get sucked in. But if you are asking me now, in the  cold light of day, if I believe there is a conspiracy or bias against  Celtic then no, I genuinely don&rsquo;t believe that.&rdquo;<br><br>That didn&rsquo;t mean  there weren&rsquo;t people out to get him. Nor did it mean, that by  identifying his enemies, Strachan was being paranoid.<br><br>He added:  &ldquo;I did think there were one or two referees who had a personal thing  against me. It wasn&rsquo;t them versus Celtic &ndash; it was them against me! I  just think they wanted to take me on.<br><br>&ldquo;It was the same with a  couple of guys in the media &ndash; I think one or two saw my reputation from  England and fancied having a bit of a fight.<br><br>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any particular newspaper or radio station &ndash; it was just one or two individuals who I clashed with.<br><br>&ldquo;And  it was the same with the refs. There was one guy in particular who just  didn&rsquo;t like me and who was desperate to put me in my place. But that  can happen to any manager at any club.<br><br>&ldquo;I remember late on in my  last season there was a game at Tannadice when we actually got away with  murder. Gary Caldwell brought someone down in the last couple of  minutes.<br><br>&ldquo;But a few a seconds before it, someone else was  elbowed. After that game I had a go at the refs. I said they should buy  themselves a video recorder and watch their own decisions.<br><br>&ldquo;But  that was about the only time I can remember criticising them. At no  point did I think this was an institutional thing against Celtic &ndash; no  way. And never in my time at the club was anyone encouraging me to go  down that road. Never.&rdquo;<br><br>Over the last month or so, Celtic&rsquo;s simmering feud with officialdom has entered a period of relative calm.<br><br>So  much so that Neil Lennon was able to see the funny side on his return  to Tannadice on Sunday when the Celtic manager admitted his full-back  Mark Wilson was fortunate not to be sen off.<br><br>It was on Tayside that all the problems began with just two words &ndash; Dougie, Dougie.<br><br>Strachan  said: &ldquo;What the officials did that day was wrong and I&rsquo;ve always had a  problem with the fact they get 48 hours to put their reports in.<br><br>&ldquo;When  I was at Coventry I was reported by the ref and two linesmen who all  said I had instigated a stramash in the technical area in a match  against Chelsea.<br><br>&ldquo;Little did they know Sky had cameras right  above it. So we took that footage to the hearing with my lawyer and we  said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve made this up &ndash; you are lying&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;I got away with it because I was clever enough to take a lawyer in with me and because I knew some people at Sky.<br><br>&ldquo;It  showed that I had nothing to do with it and that, in the case of one  linesman, it was actually impossible for him to see where I was at that  time.<br><br>&ldquo;So that proved to me that sometimes the officials do get  together to make up their own story. They are only human and I think a  lot of that goes on.<br><br>&ldquo;But when the referees then went on strike I  thought to myself, &lsquo;This is just madness&rsquo;. I must admit, part of me  thought the referees were getting a wee bit too sensitive. We live in a  yob culture these days and you have to get used to taking abuse.<br><br>&ldquo;But  then I think it went a bit further than that. They were having their  integrity and honesty called into question and that&rsquo;s where you have to  draw a line.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to take a lot of stick down the years but  the one thing that really got to me was when someone questioned my  integrity. It&rsquo;s the one thing that really grates with you.<br><br>&ldquo;So  for that reason I understood where they were coming from. Not being good  enough is one thing &ndash; but not being  honest? That&rsquo;s quite another.<br><br>&ldquo;And anyway, having said all that, I didn&rsquo;t even think they were that bad. And I would never have questioned their integrity.&rdquo;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Gordon Strachan: Keyboard cowboys have hijacked Scottish football</h3>Feb 16 2011 Keith Jackson<br>Daily Record<br>GORDON Strachan had sensed it for a while. Bit by bit he suspected the lunatics were slowly taking over the asylum.<br><br>When Hugh Dallas was booted out of the SFA it gave the former Celtic manager his final, conclusive proof.<br><br>Scottish  football, he believes, has been hijacked by bands of extremist  minorities who will stop at nothing in their seemingly endless quest to  be offended by anything and everything.<br><br>Strachan, you see, has never  quite settled into this new PC world. And the more he gets to know how  ruthlessly it works the less comfortable he has become.<br><br>First Dallas.  Then Andy Gray and Richard Keys. The bodies just keep coming. And  Strachan believes it&#39;s time for the silent majority to stand up and  reclaim the game before it is gone for good.<br><br>He said: &quot;At the time of  the Hugh Dallas sacking I read an article from Jim Traynor who said the  only thing to be offended about was the fact it was making fun of child  abuse. Jim was right.<br><br>&quot;But it was made out that Hugh was guilty of  attacking a certain religion and I couldn&#39;t get my head around that. How  many of us have had questionable emails sent to us? &quot;I get them from my  brother-in-law all the time, there&#39;s something to offend everybody but  it&#39;s meant as a joke. You can&#39;t stop that.<br><br>&quot;What about when Frankie Boyle is on TV having a pop at everybody and everything? What&#39;s the difference?<br><br>&quot;When  I spoke to Hugh he was trying to explain himself to me. I told him  there was no need - I&#39;ve lived up there, I know what it&#39;s like. He was  telling me personal stuff and trying to make it clear he was not a  bigot.<br><br>&quot;But that&#39;s the way we are now, everyone is so scared of being  branded something or other that we have to explain ourselves even when  we have done nothing wrong.<br><br>&quot;The problem is that the zealots had taken control of the situation. Hugh was having to answer to them.&quot;<br><br>That  is something Strachan simply cannot abide. &quot;Keyboard cowboys&quot; he calls  them. The virtual mobs who spout their views from behind the safety of a  computer screen.<br><br>He admits there were times when the climate they created spoiled his enjoyment of leading Celtic to three SPL titles in a row.<br><br>And he could never understand why Parkhead staff would pay t hem serious attention.<br><br>He  said: &quot;I used to say to them, &#39;What are you doing? You are meant to be  intelligent people! But you are actually listening to what these people  are saying&#39;.<br><br>&quot;I kept telling them: &#39;For all you know these people are not even Celtic supporters. Why are you worried about what they say?&#39; <br><br>&quot;These  are people who have no friends. If me and you want to have a chat about  something then we&#39;ll do that after work at the pub. But the people who  spend 10 hours a day on the internet have no one to talk to.<br><br>&quot;They  are the same people who go on X Factor. You know right away they are  useless singers but they didn&#39;t have any mates to tell them the truth.  If I told my mate I was going on X Factor he&#39;d say, &#39;Are you f******  kidding? Don&#39;t be so stupid&#39;.<br><br>&quot;But these people don&#39;t have friends to keep them right. So they go on X Factor, get four &#39;no thanks&#39; and are laughed off stage.<br><br>&quot;  So they go home disappointed they didn&#39;t make it on X Factor and think,  &#39;What will I do now? I know, I&#39;ll get my computer out and write stuff  on messageboards about Celtic and Rangers.It&#39;s the same people!&#39; <br><br>&quot;I  made a joke about it before when I said they were all dressed in  tracksuits with their devil dogs and cans of lager. That was my way of  saying this is what&#39;s happening out there. We need to be careful who we  listen to and who we allow to set the agenda.<br><br>&quot;The internet is a  powerful tool. People are bringing down the government in Egypt by going  on the internet, so it can be used for good. But you have to realise  three or four abusive idiots on a football messageboard do not speak for  the majority.<br><br>&quot;But we are all scared to stand up against them, even in jest. It&#39;s a scary situation.<br><br>&quot;Listen,  I don&#39;t dismiss the opinions of others and in Glasgow EVERYONE has an  opinion. You get to hear them every time you walk down the street. But  they were real opinions from real people, not just abusive rants from  the keyboard cowboys.<br><br>&quot;I enjoyed loads of it at the time and I enjoy  going back to Glasgow now. But when you are right in the middle of it as  manager of Celtic it&#39;s very hard to enjoy anything.<br><br>&quot;The  fundamentalists and the zealots make it that way. The whole of society  is now pandering to this very vocal minority because the ones who scream  the loudest seem to be listened to more than the silent majority. It  could be racism, sexism or bigotry but somewhere along the line the  decent majority have lost their voice.<br><br>&quot;There is a fear that if you don&#39;t agree with the fundamentalists you will be accused of being sexist, racist or a bigot.&quot;<br><br>Strachan, being as he is of the old school, was always likely to be targeted by at least one group of the morally outraged.<br><br>And he knows that even by expressing his own opinion he will almost certainly come under fire.<br><br>But  he said: &quot;Put it this way, I know someone who has watched over 1000  games. That person thinks listening to a woman commentating on a game  doesn&#39;t sound right. That person also believes women linesmen and women  refs just don&#39;t look right in the man&#39;s game.<br><br>&quot;I asked a female  journalist if she thought that was a sexist view and she said it  probably was. I then told her the person who feels this way is my wife.  Does that mean my wife is sexist?<br><br>&quot;The girl didn&#39;t know how to  answer. And that&#39;s my whole point - this was simply an opinion, a  woman&#39;s opinion. But if I said it as a man I&#39;d be branded a sexist. As a  matter of fact my wife feels more strongly about women linesmen than I  do. But that&#39;s the environment we live in.<br><br>&quot;People are scared to have  an opinion. Even governments are scared to say what&#39;s right and wrong  because a tiny minority will cause all kinds of problems.<br><br>&quot;While the  majority might be in complete agreement they are too frightened to speak  up because they&#39;ll be accused of intolerance. That doesn&#39;t just apply  to Scottish football - it&#39;s all over British society.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s why I  use the example of my wife. After watching 1000 games she has every  right to an opinion. She prefers men doing these things and I feel the  same way. You might feel the same way too but you&#39;d be scared to say  that.<br><br>&quot;Women have far more jobs in football now than 20 years ago.<br><br>So what are they complaining about? What do you want, 50-50?<br><br>&quot;You can&#39;t run things like that. You should only be rewarded for being good at your job.&quot;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>Why Gordon Strachan should have shown more love to Celtic fans<br>Mirror, May 2009<br><br>This is Gordon Strachan&#39;s idea of humour.<br><br>A reporter came up to him and asked whether he could have a quick word.<br><br>&quot;Velocity,&quot; replied the former Celtic manager.<br><br>Ha, bloody, ha.<br><br>Strachan, despite great success as Celtic manager, was unpopular among the press and a large percentage of fans.<br><br>Strachan  has always been something of a smart arse but does that make it fair  that the press are often harsh on him and, in turn, the fans are often  left reading negative articles about their manager?<br><br>I&#39;m sure that  Strachan would deem it to be extremely unfair. If he is judged on  results then he should go down as something of a Celtic legend.<br><br>But  for someone who thinks he&#39;s so much more intelligent than everyone else  in the room at a press conference - and I&#39;ve suffered Strachan during  his time at Southampton - he&#39;s got it hopelessly wrong.<br><br>Sir Alex  Ferguson dislikes the majority of reporters. In fact, he has sheer  contempt for them. But his record as Manchester United manager is  unparalelled.<br><br>Therefore, it&#39;s difficult to knock Ferguson. But  Ferguson also understands the importance of communicating with United  fans through the media. He also fully understands the importance of fans  to the club.<br><br>Time and again you will read or hear Ferguson  talking about the special United fans in the media. Their importance to  the team. Their magnificent support. That&#39;s something Strachan  overlooked.<br><br>Also, if Strachan was asked a question about tactics  then he saw it as a personal insult and regarded it as a sleight on his  managerial ability, as if a fan had walked in from the terraces and was  questioning a substitution. He couldn&#39;t accept that fans have a right to  their opinion.<br><br>Cuter managers understand the importance of  playing the media game - not just to appease us reporters, but to  communicate and have a relationship with the fans.<br><br>The fans are  the most important thing in football. They rule. They also pay the  bills. Too many people in football have forgotten that. Too many people  disrespect them.<br><br>Strachan disrespected them and no amount of success could win them over.<br><br>Read more: <a class="external" href="http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/john-cross/Why-Gordon-Strachan-should-have-shown-more-love-to-Celtic-fans-article26620.html#ixzz1EJtz9OvE" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/john-cross/Why-Gordon-Strachan-should-have-shown-more-love-to-Celtic-fans-article26620.html#ixzz1EJtz9OvE</a> <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3><span class="diffAdd">Secret Footballer book</span></h3></div><div></div><img align="bottom" alt="Strachan, Gordon - Misc articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="497" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/a5c359f5b9c4b20613ad5296252660da/GW708H497" title="Strachan, Gordon - Misc articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="708"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Strachan, Gordon - Misc articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="683" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d8e10ece4a238101f7bdcd3664d40e0c/GW709H683" title="Strachan, Gordon - Misc articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="709"><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3><br></h3><div><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3><br></h3></div></div></div><br><br></div>
