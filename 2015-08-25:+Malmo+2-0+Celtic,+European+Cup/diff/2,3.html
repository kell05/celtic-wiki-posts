And credit where it&#39;s due, the atmosphere at the game looked electric. Now onto Celtic...</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Absolutely devastated that we&#39;ve failed to qualify for the Champions League. Not only the goals we conceded but the fact we went out with a whimper.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">There was a complete lack of urgency in the 2nd half and while - as the stats show - we had most of the possession, we created zilch. Well unless you count a couple of tame efforts towards goal from Forrest and Mulgrew IIRC.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Player wise only Gordon, Forrest and Janko can hold their heads up high. Meanwhile both centre backs were run ragged by Rosenberg, defended their corners like amateurs and generally did not step up to the plate. Speaking of which, it&#39;s been a fun ride Virgil, farewell. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Mulgrew at left back was... Mulgrew at left back. Brown was once again below par as prior versus Qarabag. Bitton was (is) far too casual at releasing the ball and prior to being substituted was on the verge of a Kayal-at-Rugby-Park meltdown. Griffiths was anonymous and moronic, as was Johansen. Finally Armstrong was okay before coming off at HT, his replacement had no impact, GMS anonymous and Ciftci made fat air as per usual. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">As for the manager. While it would be ludicrous to contemplate sacking him, assuming we&#39;ll stroll to 5IAR we have a major decision to make at the end of the season. Can the club be confident that Ronny will triumph at essentially his 4th attempt at qualifying for the Champions League? I have serious doubts. Despite the undoubted progress made from October 2014 to now, it has counted for very little. In some ways it&#39;s a relief as we would be absolutely annihilated by Europe&#39;s elite, Bale v Boyata makes me cringe just thinking about it. What I am certain of is that Deila realises how much of a setback this is and I can only hope he isn&#39;t further hung dry in the final week of the transfer window.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I&#39;ve said this before but I think some are seriously deluded at how limited we are as a team. As has been the case in many key European games in his 2 years at the club, Virgil showed flaws which are hidden by pissing our league every week. He has all the attributes and is potentially world class but some are too idealistic about his current level. While Johansen is an extremely sloppy passer, doesn&#39;t convert chances at crucial points in games and is petulant. Even Brown&#39;s limitations - average technique, can&#39;t make forward passes et al - are sorely evident at this level; the fact he remains our most important player speaks volumes and it pains me to say so. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And still people call Malmo pish and inferior to Qarabag, sometimes I wonder what planet some people are on. The difference between Rosenberg and our new #7 is night and day. Our forward-line is merely a slightly stronger version of Dundee United&#39;s quartet from 2013-14. As I read earlier we essentially won the first 10 minutes of the tie 2-0, but lost the final three hours 4-1. Even if we hadn&#39;t been robbed out of a Malmo red card and pen (can&#39;t assume we&#39;d have converted it either), I still don&#39;t think we&#39;d have avoided elimination. We are a Europa League level side on the park, with a Champions League level remuneration for our beloved CEO.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Speaking of the board. Bar Adam Matthews&#39; successful clearance off the line against Karagandy, Celtic would have now failed to qualify for the Champions League group stage for 3 years running. Even with that qualification, our record since Strachan left stands as 2 qualifications in 7 seasons. It&#39;s truly an appalling record and it makes that Last 16 qualification in 2012/13 seem like light years ago. Now I know a minority of, let&#39;s be frank, Celtic sycophants who refuse to criticise the club could say &#39;Ah but that&#39;s football, we don&#39;t have the big money anymore so who are we to say we should be knocking out the Swedish champions?&#39;. As Sutton illustrated in his post-match analysis, that sums up how the board have ground expectations to such an all time low. The fact we have a budget 5-10 times as big as the likes of Malmo and Maribor means nothing. The fact we&#39;ve been seeded for every UCL qualifier we&#39;ve faced since Braga in 2010 means nothing. The fact Lawwell is paid a seven figure salary, despite the club missing out yet again on &pound;20million means nothing.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Still we all know nothing will change. We&#39;ll all forget about this come November, when we&#39;ve stormed ahead of Hearts and KDS produces a thousand pages upon the rebirth of the Sevco thread following an oh-so-hilarious loss in the 2nd tier for a club which I assure you we don&#39;t care about.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Last year I was angry, now I&#39;m simply apathetic. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">(Just in j of KDS)</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I&#39;ve never read so much nonsense on a website.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I rarely ever come onto the match thread and this thread has just confirmed why.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">When did Celtic become this Champions League team that would steamroll every &quot;wee&quot; team in front of us?</span><br><span class="diffAdd">If you actually watch Celtic, you&#39;ll realise that we are not a great team. As for the best supporters in the world, give me a break.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Last week&#39;s home game against Malmo witnessed thousands of tourists stumbling about trying to find their allocated seats - where are they when it&#39;s bread and butter league games?</span><br><span class="diffAdd">We have no money because of the league we play in - because Sky pour so much into the EPL - because EUFA ensure that the rich clubs get richer every year - not certain, but I reckon the 2 top seeds in each CL group made it into the knockout stages last year - the seeding system works, they ensure the top teams progress and get richer, so creating a bigger gap in monetary terms. When was the last time a minnow won the CL? Atletico Madrid are the closest we&#39;ve had to a minnow team getting to the final and they only managed it by some god awful football.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Previous CL campaigns have spoiled us. We now believe we should be there every year.  The teams we are meeting have similar expectations and most of the games are evenly matched, decided by a piece of magic /  lucky break or a defensive mistake (Celtic&#39;s defense provided the mistakes in the Malmo tie).</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic have been forced to downsize because we can&#39;t afford to do anything else.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Would you rather we racked up massive debts just to speculate that we might qualify for CL football?</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I  certainly wouldn&#39;t.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Monaco got horsed out of the CL last night - how much is their wage bill / outlay on transfers ?</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Spending money doesn&#39;t guarantee success - how much have Liverpool invested in players in the last couple of years and how successful has their European adventures been?</span><br><span class="diffAdd">We&#39;re still in Europe - the Europa league might not be as glamorous, but it&#39;s still should be something to look forward to (the 25,000 of us that will buy our tickets and support the team anyway).</span><br><span class="diffAdd">We had a bad night, we met a team who knew how to win the game - over the 2 legs we had the majority of possession, but the fewer shots on target. Malmo were more clinical and made fewer mistakes.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">WQe operate in Scotland - we have no money - all we can ask is that what money we do have is invested properly. Up until tonight I&#39;ve not read that many negative articles about the players we&#39;ve bought recently. Strange how the whole lot of them have become duds overnight.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">I&#39;m away back to the general discussion website. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">(Patrick B of KDS)</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Pretty angry this morning. We need a major shake up.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Craig Gordon - He was poor for both goals. I&#39;ve mentioned a few times that he needs to stop parrying the ball back into the six yard box. He needs to be stronger at corners.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Saidy Janko - He&#39;s a kid and is inexperienced, but tried hard and was the least of our problems</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Dedryk Boyata - He&#39;s a big lad and needs to be stronger. He&#39;s also a bigger liability than Efe on the ball</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Virgil Van Dijk - Wasn&#39;t really arsed, and is on his way.

The injured Lustig and Emilio Izaguirre dropped out, the latter named among the substitutes.<br> <br> There was a full house in the Malmo New Stadium and the home support created an impressive atmosphere as proceedings got underway, hoping to watch their team make a flying start.<br> <br> But it was the Bhoys who threatened first as Stuart Armstrong fastened onto a Craig Gordon&rsquo;s long clearance and found himself in space down the left. He failed in his attempt to pick out James Forrest but Janko was quick to react, delivering an inviting low delivery from the opposite flank, which Leigh Griffiths was close to reaching.<br> <br> That stung Malmo into action and Jo Inge Berget sent a shot whizzing beyond the far post, before the same player cut the ball back from the byline, with Virgil van Dijk on hand to hook the danger clear.<br> <br> Berget, who had scored a brace against the Hoops in the first-leg, looked a man on a mission in the opening stages and slid a dangerous ball across goal that was just behind Rosenberg.<br> <br> With the game being played at a furious pace, it was hosts who had the next effort as Berget blasted over after the ball had been headed back into his path from a set-piece.<br> <br> Griffiths displayed his menace as he chased an long clearance from Janko, outpaced the Malmo backline and firing wide from the angle.<br> <br> The speed and enterprise of Forrest and Armstrong on either flank continued to look a promising outlet as the visitors won several corners. When one of them was only partially cleared, van Dijk was close to meeting a cross at the far post.<br> <br> But just when Celtic looked like they were growing in ascendency, Malmo broke the deadlock at the other end. As Rosenberg tried to wriggle clear in the box, Boyata was forced to concede a corner. Yotun swung in the resultant cross and Rosenberg glanced in beyond Gordon. <br> <br> Forrest cut inside and shot straight at Wiland as the Hoops sought at instant reply, and the goal they now required to go through.<br> <br> The clearest chances were falling the way of the home side though and Boyata had to make a last-ditch block to halt Rosenberg&rsquo;s drive.<br> <br> Celtic, however, should have been level three minutes before the break after Johansen&rsquo;s corner caused a melee before Bitton stabbed the ball home. Defender Kari Arnason also looked to have clearly handled the ball but somehow the referee disallowed the goal for a Celtic foul.<br> <br> But the Hoops had Gordon to thank on the stroke of half-time as his superb reaction save from Nikola Djurdjic prevented Malmo from doubling their advantage.<br> <br> Kris Commons replaced Armstrong at the start of the second half but it was Age Hareide&rsquo;s side who threatened first as Rosenberg shot wide after an attack down the right.<br> <br> Some enterprising thrusts from Janko down the right and Forrest on the opposite flank served notice of Celtic&rsquo;s intention but their task became even steeper as Malmo struck again.<br> <br> Gordon produced an incredible double save to deny Vladimir Rodic and then Rosenberg from the rebound. However, he was left to pick the ball out of his net moments later as Celtic failed to deal from the corner and the ball trundled in via the unfortunate Boyata. <br> <br> Try as they might, the Hoops couldn&rsquo;t get the goal that would provide them a glimmer of hope, with speculative efforts from Griffiths and Commons the best they could muster on a night of huge disappointment in Sweden. <br> <br> CELTIC (4-2-3-1) Gordon;

opening to the match but the complexion of the tie was about to change. <br> <br> Yoshimar Yotun&#39;s left foot whipped a fierce corner delivery in from the right and Rosenberg rose above Van Dijk to make the crucial connection, albeit with his shoulder rather than his head. <br> <br> Malmo looked equally fragile when trying to defend a Celtic corner as Bitton leapt to meet the cross and then knocked in the resulting loose ball. <br> <br> Kari Arnason and Nir Bitton Celtic might have been awarded a penalty in the first half <br> <br> Serbian referee Milorad Mazic, who had just booked Griffiths for clattering into Anton Tinnerholm, blew for a foul against the away team but replays showed that Bitton&#39;s marker, Kari Arnason, had handled in the challenge. <br> <br> Buoyed by that let-off, Malmo pressed for a second on the night and Rosenberg cut back for Nikola Djurdjic, who was only denied by a terrific Craig Gordon save. <br> <br> Celtic failed to heed the warning and the same two players combined again early in the second half with Rosenberg firing wide. <br> <br> And Gordon came to the Scottish champions&#39; rescue again with a brilliant double-save, blocking Vladimir Rodic&#39;s drive and Rosenberg&#39;s rebound. <br> <br> But the keeper was then left exposed at Rodic&#39;s corner as substitute Felipe Carvalho nodded towards goal and Boyata&#39;s boot touched the ball over the line, despite the best efforts of Gordon. <br> <br> Deila, who had sent Kris Commons on for Stuart Armstrong at half-time, introduced Nadir Ciftci and then Gary Mackay-Steven as Bitton and James Forrest were withdrawn. <br> <br> But the substitute trio could not instigate the two-goal comeback Celtic needed with Commons&#39; long-range effort over the closest they came. <br> <br> What now for Celtic?<br> It&#39;s a second Europa League group stage campaign in a row for the Scottish champions. <br> <br> Celtic manager Ronny Deila Deila&#39;s goal of managing Celtic in the Champions League group stage remains unfulfilled for now <br> <br> Last term, Deila&#39;s men reached the last 32 of the tournament, losing to Inter Milan over two legs, but the Norwegian had stressed in recent weeks that reaching the Champions League group stage with Celtic had been his goal since joining the club last summer. <br> <br> With Van Dijk a likely departure and Boyata having only recently joined, Deila faces the task of rebuilding his defence for Europe and Celtic&#39;s Premiership defence.<br> <br> <br> Celtic were &#39;scared&#39; in Champions League loss to Malmo<br> Celtic were &quot;scared and frightened&quot; in their Champions League exit to Malmo, said boss Ronny Deila. <br> http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34058329<br> The Scottish champions went out 4-3 on aggregate after a 2-0 defeat in Sweden. <br> <br> Deila said: &quot;The hype about the Champions League is big, everybody wants it so badly. You have to deal with it but we looked very stressed. <br> <br> &quot;We didn&#39;t look like we wanted to go out and play football. We have a lot of young players coming through but this was a hard lesson for us.&quot; <br> <br> The Norwegian was new to the Celtic manager&#39;s job when his team was knocked out in the play-off round last season by Slovenian side Maribor. <br> <br> But having reshaped the team on his way to winning the Scottish Premiership in his debut season and across this summer, he was confident he could guide them into the group stage of the Champions League at the expense of the Swedish champions. <br> <br> And with a 3-2 lead heading to Malmo&#39;s 20,000 capacity stadium his side were in a strong position to qualify. <br> <br> Malmo are fifth in the Swedish league, seven points off the leaders with only nine matches to play of their summer season. <br> <br> But Celtic will now compete in the Europa League and find out their opponents in Friday&#39;s group stage draw. Among the teams in Europe&#39;s second-tier competition are Liverpool and Tottenham. <br> <br> &quot;We looked very uncomfortable on the ball. We looked frightened and scared and that is very disappointing,&quot; he said in his media conference afterwards. <br> <br> &quot;It was a team performance that was not at the level we should expect at these games. We have to learn from this, some very hard learning. <br> <br> &quot;We knew if we were at our best we had a good chance to go through but we were not even close. <br> <br> Malmo celebrate as Celtic midfielder Kris Commons trudges off Celtic midfielder Kris Commons (right) was unable to drag his team back into the tie when he came on as a substitute <br> <br> &quot;We have shown that the Europa League is the level we have to compete at and it is better than nothing. It is a good competition.&quot; <br> <br> Asked about the goal Nir Bitton had disallowed for a foul - replays showing that Bitton&#39;s marker, Kari Arnason, had handled the ball in the aerial challenge - Deila felt Serbian referee Milorad Mazic had made &quot;a big mistake&quot;. <br> <br> &quot;It could have changed the game - it is irritating that we lost that,&quot; he said.<br> <br> Match Stats PossessionMalm&ouml; FFCeltic66%34%90<br> minsShots18 8 On target5 2 Corners7 5 Fouls14 14 <br> Live Text Commentary<br> Full time Full Time <br> Match ends, Malm&ouml; FF 2, Celtic 0. <br> 90:00 +5:01 Full time Full Time <br> Second Half ends, Malm&ouml; FF 2, Celtic 0. <br> 90:00 +4:35 Delay over.
