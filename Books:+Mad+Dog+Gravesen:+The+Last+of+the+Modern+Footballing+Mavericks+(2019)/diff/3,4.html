Below are an insight into some of the tales  found in Mad Dog Gravesen: The Last of the Modern Footballing Mavericks.<br><br>Mad Dog Gravesen: The Last of the Modern Footballing Mavericks by Chris Sweeney is on sale now from Pitch Publishing<br>A dip in the bubble pool<br><br>There  was a bizarre incident while at Hamburg in which Thomas and  partner-in-crime Allan Jepsen decided to have a laugh one afternoon.<br>[gravesen.jpg]<br>A new book on Gravesen is released this month<br><br>They  covered the entire wellness area at the team&rsquo;s training base in foam,  soap and shampoo, so it became their own personal giant, infinity-style  swimming pool made of bubbles.<br><br>The pair got naked and began  sliding through the whole building all the way to the swimming pool,  where they launched in by doing cannonballs. A member of staff was  alerted and came in to catch the young Danes having the time of their  lives. Their only punishment was to clean the place up before the  manager saw it.<br>Chopper Gravesen<br><br>It was only thanks to HSV team-mate Bernd Hollerbach that Thomas and his love of motorbikes was rumbled too.<br><br>Defender  Hollerbach had a reputation for driving very fast in his Porsche,  ignoring any speed limits where they were in place as Germany&rsquo;s Autobahn  allows drivers to go as fast as they like in some parts<br><br>A club  insider revealed how one day Hollerbach arrived at HSV&rsquo;s training ground  looking crestfallen but also with an expression of shock on his face.  The source said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;d been speeding as usual, overtaking everyone, when  out of nowhere a biker flew past him doing 160mph. The rider was  clinging on for dear life dressed in a t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops  but his identity was hidden under a helmet. The tale goes that with a  shake of the head, Hollerbach sighed, &lsquo;The bloke must have had a screw  loose &rsquo;. It was only when he got inside to change for training that he  spotted Thomas standing there in a t-shirt, shorts and flip-flops. It  was him who&rsquo;d been riding the bike! He was casually getting ready,  thinking nothing of it, and went out for the day&rsquo;s session leaving  Hollerbach dumbfounded.<br><br>The club then discovered that Thomas  wasn&rsquo;t just using the motorbike for high-speed dashes to training. He  was actually going home to Vejle most days of the week. One way, the  journey is 175 miles and usually takes around three hours, but speed  freak Thomas was doing it in well under two. He&rsquo;d leave training, go  home, and then come back for the next session. It underlined just how  much energy Thomas had and with no one there to rein him in, he was  spending his days driving like a maniac back to the small, sleepy town  where he felt most at ease.<br>The other half<br><br>Archie Knox who  was the assistant manager when Thomas joined Everton said, &lsquo;He just got  into scrapes left, right and centre. He always had plenty to say, he&rsquo;d  challenge everything even in training, but Thomas always insisted that  he was in the right. There was never a chance of him backing down. He  was that determined, to him he was always in the right. But he had more  good about him than he had bad, there&rsquo;s no doubt about that.&#39;<br><br>As well as always acting up and having a laugh in training, Archie was fascinated by how Thomas interacted with  his childhood sweetheart Gitte Pedersen. She&rsquo;d also left Hamburg and  joined Everton&rsquo;s ladies&rsquo; team. After he&rsquo;d done his work for the day,  Thomas and Gitte would do extra training and play against each other.  Archie could barely believe his eyes at what one of the strongest and  most powerful players in the English Premier League, known for its high  degree of physicality, was up to. Archie was shocked as he saw Thomas  flying into tackles and using his body as if he was in the middle of a  full-blooded match Instead, it was with his own childhood sweetheart in  an indoor hall. Archie recalled, &lsquo;She played for the ladies&rsquo; team and  they used to go in the gym and play one v ones But he&rsquo;d batter the ball  at her as if he was playing against a man It was in the big indoor gym  at Bellefield [Everton&rsquo;s training ground] They&rsquo;d play for ages in there,  the two of them going at it &rsquo;.<br>Some summer<br><br>Then at Celtic he had the entire club scratching their heads about what his plans were for the summer break.<br><br>Normal  service is for players to be pictured on golden beaches in far-flung  places, cruising about in exotic sports cars or on Sunseeker yachts.  After all, they&rsquo;re wealthy young men with free time on their hands, but  not Thomas.<br><br></font></font></font></font></font><div><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica">Celtic team-mate Mark Wilson explained: &lsquo;When he  came to the club, I was 23 or so, we were all into Call of Duty at that  point, so when Thomas came in he said he played it as well. We didn&rsquo;t  know how good he was and he said his mate was the top player in the  world. We looked him up and he was. Then, at the end of that season,  when we asked him, &ldquo;What are you doing in the summer?&rdquo;, Thomas said  &ldquo;Just back home, lad&rdquo; and he said he&rsquo;d go back to his parents&rsquo; house, go  in the basement and play computer games constantly. I&rsquo;m thinking,  &ldquo;Jesus Christ, this guy has got millions, he could go anywhere in the  world and at that time he had his porn star girlfriend and he goes home  to sit in a basement &rdquo;. It was so far from what a footballer of his  stature was about.&#39; </font></font></font></font></font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><h3><span class="diffAdd">  Mad Dog Gravesen &ndash; The Last of the Modern Footballing Mavericks</span></h3><span class="diffAdd"> By Editor 17 February, 2019 No Comments</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> https://thecelticstar.com/mad-dog-gravesen-the-last-of-the-modern-footballing-mavericks/</span><br><span class="diffAdd">  MAD DOG GRAVESEN &ndash; The Last of the Modern Footballing Mavericks by  Chris Sweeney has just been published by Pitch Publishing. The Celtic  Star spoke to the author about one of the maddest players ever to have  pulled on the Hoops and why he decided to write a book about the Great  Dane. Below is our exclusive interview with the author of Mad Dog  Gravesen &ndash; The Last of the Modern Football Mavericks and next we&rsquo;ll  publish a Celtic specific extract from this entertaining new book, so  stay tuned to The Celtic Star for that!</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Hi Chris, MAD DOG  GRAVESEN &ndash; The Last of the Modern Footballing Mavericks is your new book  that&rsquo;s just been published by Pitch Publishing. Congratulations on  that! Can you tell us something about the book, what the reader can  expect and why you decided to write a book about the Great Dane?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  I decided to write about Thomas as I was fascinated with him, more as a  person than a footballer. I felt he was well-known for his career on  the field, but a lot about his off-field persona wasn&rsquo;t so well known.  It struck me that we no longer have these larger than life characters in  top level sport, particularly football.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> You don&rsquo;t get that  intangible quality anymore, a lot of the players now come through the  academies and are so sanitised, a guy like Thomas would never have made  made it through that sort of environment. I hope people get a book that  lets them find out about the man behind the player and also reminds the  fans how refreshing and inspiring it can be when you encounter a true  maverick, which without a doubt Thomas is.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> This is your second  book, but the first one that&rsquo;s football related. What was your first  book about and how did you go from there to writing about the former  Celtic star Tommy Gravesen?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> My first book was about the BMX  star John Buultjens who&rsquo;s from Glasgow, he went from being thrown in a  fire by his abusive father, to then being locked up for attacking him  with a kitchen knife, to being adopted and discovering BMX which allowed  him to live a completely different life. His journey has since been  turned into a movie with Steven Speilberg even giving it his support. I  went from there to Thomas quite easily. I&rsquo;m attracted to people who are  cut from a different cloth and live without compromises.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> You&rsquo;ve  interviewed some big stars over the years, including the likes of P  Diddy, Amy Winehouse, Mike Fleetwwod and Jon Bon Jovi. Any interesting  stories you can share about interviewing these stars?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> That was  really my day job and how I got started in the media, I actually still  do some of that now. In terms of stories, if anyone remembers P Diddy  coming to Glasgow to perform for MTV, I was the one who talked him into  wearing the kilt that night. But when we were talking as I was  explaining why he should do it, I gave him the line &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got the legs  for it&rdquo; which I think due to different cultures and in his macho world,  I don&rsquo;t think he was used to a guy telling him that. So we had a few  awkward moments before he realised where I was coming from.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  I&rsquo;ve thrown clumps of mud at Sex Pistols&rsquo; fans with Calvin Harris who  were giving him stick and started throwing mud at him first, so we  returned the compliment. Most of the big names are pretty decent people,  I really like Mark Ronson who always enjoys a chat, Noel Gallagher  loves if you bring up football as he&rsquo;s sick of being asked the same  things, so last time we had a chat about why Manchester City seem to  give so many players to Celtic. Another guy who loves his football is  Maxi Jazz from Faithless, he was telling me about how he has to go all  proper to games now as he&rsquo;s a director at Crystal Palace.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> What  did you learn about Tommy Gravesen&rsquo;s time at Celtic &ndash; it&rsquo;s fair to say  that he seemed to split opinions among the support at the time?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  The main thing I learned was ironically what spurred me on to write the  book, there is a lot of unknown and mystery there. The Celtic fans I  spoke to are bemused about what happened, and lots of them recall how he  scored twice against Rangers. Here was a guy coming from Real Madrid,  clearly with tons of ability and he ends up only playing for one season  and ultimately retires aged 32 after going on a youth team trip to  Ireland. That was the last anyone heard of him for several years until  he resurfaced in Las Vegas. I hope the book opens up some of those  mysteries and provides some answers.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Clearly after his football  career, things seemed to get even crazier for Tommy Gravesen. What can  you tell us about his life after he hung up his boots?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He moved  to Vegas but now lives back in Denmark. There are lots of rumours about  how much money he has earned and how he earned it. With Thomas it is  hard to nail anything down, he&rsquo;s a recluse of sorts and in Denmark has  even been nicknamed The Unicorn due to his mythical status.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> What&rsquo;s the story about Gravesen and Mike Tyson and is it true that he once brought dynamite to training?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  Yep, dynamite was brought into training in Hamburg. He referred to it  as his &ldquo;special fireworks&rdquo; &ndash; the tale is in the book, but a crater was  left on the training field that day. Mike Tyson was enchanted by Thomas  after going to see an international game in Copenhagen, he loved his  aggressive and free-wheeling style. So much so, Tyson asked for his  shirt and wore it for the rest of his time in Denmark, as he was there  for a fight which set up his big clash with Lennox Lewis.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> We  understand that you spoke to someone in each of his club and  international dressing rooms, from Vejle, Hamburg, Everton, Real Madrid  and Celtic, plus Denmark at World Cup/Euros. There must have been some  common themes coming across in these conversations about Tommy?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  The book goes through all of his life and career, and everybody  remembers him vividly. He was a guy who made a serious impression, no  matter where he went. One thing that gets overlooked with all the  outlandish antics and bizarre incidents is that he was a top player with  bags of skill. All the football people were keen to stress how good he  was and probably better than most fans appreciated. But they all said  they would not be surprised to learn of anything he&rsquo;d done, nothing is  impossible when it comes to Thomas.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Tell us about him  apparently making a &pound;100million fortune in Las Vegas &ndash; is this true and  what is the story about him losing another fortune in high stakes poker  game?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> There is a tale of him losing $54 million in a single  game of one-on-one poker. Plus there&rsquo;s the news of him winning the &pound;100  million fortune. Thomas has never said any of it is true or not, but my  book looks at the reasons behind it. Although one thing I do say in the  book, Gordon Strachan claiming Thomas makes a fortune as the second best  Call of Duty players in the world is rubbish.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Is there still a place for mavericks like Gravesen in football and if not, do you think that the game is poorer for it?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  I don&rsquo;t think there is. Even if you take a club like Celtic in a  relatively small commercial market like Scotland, the stadium is  plastered with corporate signs or adverts. The game is now a business  and that has turned the players into assets, so image and perception are  important.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> The academies churn out these strong, fit and  talented athletes but hardly any display a real distinctive character  and if they do have it, they chose to suppress it. I&rsquo;m not having a pop  at Celtic as all the clubs are in the same situation, but is there  anyone in the squad that fans would love to know more about or find  really interesting as a person?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I think Thomas is one of the  few players in recent history that fall into that bracket and probably  the last we&rsquo;ll see for a long time reach the levels of being somewhere  like Real Madrid.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Do you keep in touch with Celtic games from  your home in Zurich and if so what do you think of the current Celtic  side as opposed to the team that Tommy Gravesen was apart of?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  I&rsquo;m not a massive Celtic fan any longer. My father is a diehard and  really is far more passionate than me. I did get a season ticket one  year for Christmas though and when I was a boy I&rsquo;d get the players  autographs, the best memory of that time is how genuine and warm Tommy  Burns was. Him giving his time and seemingly caring about me standing  there to meet him, how he conducted himself around me had a far bigger  impact than me watching Pierre van Hooijdonk score in the &rsquo;95 Scottish  Cup Final to end the long trophy drought or going to some of the big  European games during the run to Seville.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Where can Celtic supporters get a copy of Mad Dog Gravesen?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  They can get in book shops, it should be in the main ones like  Waterstones. But it&rsquo;s also on Amazon if they prefer that and they can  ORDER HERE or click on the book cover below&hellip;</span></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></h3></div><div><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></font></font></font></font></div><br></div>
