To all and sundry it looked like the good Doctor had taken his eye off the ball and got the tactics wrong. The exclusion of Burchill seemed perplexing given his form in the last few games. With three subs only, Dr Jo chose to put a back up goalkeeper on the bench rather than an outfield player. <br>A long, depressing walk back to the City Centre.  <br>  <table align="bottom"

class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>completed their avowed feat of mopping-up all season 1998-99&#39;s domestic<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>trophies yesterday in a match in which they prospered and Celtic once<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>more wilted. This Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park was never an<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>exhilarating aria in terms of its football, but Dick Advocaat, the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Rangers coach, can certainly sing in his bath of his accomplishments<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>this term. <br>Rod Wallace, supposedly tracked by Enrico Annoni in a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>plan hatched by Jozef Venglos, sprang Rangers a goal after 48 minutes<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>which Celtic were doomed never to equal. The Ibrox club weathered stern<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>tests in patches of both halves but, save for some skirmishes around<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Stefan Klos which the German handled stoically, the winners never quite<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>came under sustained siege by Celtic. In the 80th minute, indeed,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Jonathan Gould pounced adroitly to his left to block a Gabriel Amato<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>shot that would have made these closing 10 minutes irrelevant. <br>The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>match was a triumph for Rangers, certainly in the sense of Advocaat&#39;s<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>gritty resilience which transmits to his players, in his valued use of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>such players as Tony Vidmar, who yesterday played astutely, and in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>way his team bounds forward through players such as Wallace, Jorg<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Albertz and Neil McCann. Long have been the waxing portraits produced of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Celtic&#39;s historically gallivanting style but this Rangers side of the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dutchman&#39;s deserves every bit as much credit. Only the sixth treble in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the Ibrox club&#39;s history has come around through an attitude focused to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>attack, a policy Advocaat clearly relishes continuing, in announcing<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>last night a two-year extension to his current contract. <br>In one<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>solitary second in this game there was a moment of Celtic outcry, of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>injustice felt in the bloodstream, but it was flawed and quite mistaken.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span><br>In one of their impassioned bursts of assault, Paul Lambert&#39;s shot<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>cannoned against Lorenzo Amoruso, and the Celtic players mobbed Hugh<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dallas, the referee, beseeching the penalty. Dallas, with some<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>composure, withstood that unsightly buffeting, and television showed the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>ball clearly played the Italian&#39;s chest. <br>Hence, this match was one<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>more bitter chapter for the Celtic faithful to absorb, and the debate<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>will now go on about the esteemed role of Jozef Venglos. Yesterday,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Venglos omitted Mark Burchill completely, twinning Lubomir Moravcik with<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Henrik Larsson in attack, and playing Annoni in an unusual role,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>decisions that will inevitably come under attack. The Slovakian, it must<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>be said, looked pallid and tired at the end of this, a sign that this<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>essentially cultivated man isn&#39;t one for the rancid headlines he assumed<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>would follow. <br>The squall forever blowing up at the omission of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Burchill is certainly odd, given that, firstly, more than a few astute,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>though less voluble observers, reserve doubts about his talents, and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>secondly, his replacement on the Celtic bench, Tommy Johnson, had scored<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>three goals in three matches. If the fact remains that Venglos is<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>probably more a football analyst than an enforcer, Celtic&#39;s main hurt<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>yesterday remained not tactics, but their loss of four players. There<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was also a lame performance from Larsson, a player whose feats this<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>season have clearly left him jaded. <br>It might be doubted if Mark<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Viduka, one of those missing for Celtic, would have made any impression<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>here. Such games are rarely lauded for their stalwart defensive duties,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>but in this match, a crop of rearguard figures deserved the laurels<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>traditionally given to strikers. For Celtic, Johan Mjallby made<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>thrusting, incisive tackles, despite being prohibitively booked as early<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>as the 16th minute, and between Mjallby and Alan Stubbs, the buffeting<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>style of Amato was manfully cordoned. Amato&#39;s habit is to howl to the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>referee for himself being the victim of much hacking, but in this game,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>he was lucky not to be booked for a blatant dive after Tom Boyd had<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>failed to touch him. <br>In these eulogies to defenders, nor can this<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>match be allowed to pass without noting the bellowing hymn wafting off<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the Rangers support in repeated homage to Lorenzo Amoruso. It wasn&#39;t one<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>full winter ago, of course, since this memorably conceited Italian was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>being harangued at Ibrox for a style that mixed posing and dozing in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>equal measure. When the Rangers support, in fine unison yesterday, sang<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>of there being &quot;only one Amoruso&quot;, you almost quaked at the dramatic<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>sea-change in this man&#39;s fortunes. One of the final sights of this<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>occasion yesterday was this mad celebratory dance which Amoruso<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>practices, a movement which must worry psychiatrists. <br>In the face of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the excellence of both Stubbs and Mjallby, though, Celtic were pierced<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>after 48 minutes. In his fluid formation, Venglos had tried Annoni in a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>man-marking role on Wallace, a tactic that ended with the Italian<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>trudging off after 61 minutes. Thirteen minutes earlier, strategy had<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>nothing to do with Wallace&#39;s strike: Vidmar&#39;s cross met the boot of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>McCann, whose shot was blocked, and when the ball broke to Wallace, he<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>belted it past Gould. Whatever the cruel fates they felt were strewn<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>across this match, Celtic could do no more than tear at Rangers in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>second period. From Boyd&#39;s cross, Larsson couldn&#39;t have known the time<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>and space he had for his header, and the chance was lost. From a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>double-salvo from Stubbs from 18 yards, Colin Hendry was waylaid by the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>first, and Klos bravely stood his ground to fist the second. Johnson&#39;s<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>shot then looped tantalisingly wide of the post as Rangers weathered<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>whatever Celtic threw at them. <br>If this is big Stubbs&#39;s last match<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>for Celtic, his career in Scotland should not go neglected. Yesterday he<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was full of spirit, brave, and hungrily assaulting this game, but<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Celtic, ultimately, needed more cultured gifts yesterday.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Player Ratings:</h3>    <b>Jonathan Gould</b><span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>(7) - The big Englishman turned in another accomplished display between<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the sticks and made some important stops towards the end of the first<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>half. Never put a foot wrong. His kick-outs from pass backs nearly<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>always found a Celtic man. <br><br><b>Tom Boyd</b> (8) - The skipper<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>didn&#39;t deserve to be on the losing side on Saturday afternoon. Boyd did<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>an excellent man-marking job on Neil McCann and was an inspiration.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Defended comfortably and put in some saving tackles<br><br><b>Alan Stubbs</b><span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>(7) - One of Celtic&#39;s better players, the big defender will be<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>disappointed to end his career on such a low note. Stubbs mopped up<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>almost everything at the back and came close to getting himself on the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>scoresheet from set pieces a few times. A towering figure in the Celtic<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>defence. <br><br><b>Johan Mjallby</b> (6) - Had a fascinating duel with Amato, with honours just about even after the 90 minutes. <br>However,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>he won&#39;t fancy watching too many replays of the incident when the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Argentine stitched him up with an outrageous piece of skill on the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>touchline. He was booked as early as the 15th minute but was not put off<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his game.

Didn&#39;t do much wrong and defended reasonably well<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>before being replaced by Phil O&#39;Donnell. Considering the amount of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>pressure he was under performed reasonably well. Needed to get forward<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>more.<br><br><b>Morten Weighorst</b> (5) - Handed an unfamiliar slot on<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the right-hand side of midfield, the role soon looked alien to the big<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dane, who contributed nothing in either defence or attack. Had to work<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his socks off just to counter the runs from Vidmar, Albertz and Wallace.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span><br><br><b>Enrico Annoni</b> (6) - The Italian was handed the task of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>stifling Rod Wallace and did his job reasonably well though he seemed to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>take time to adjust to the pace of the game and was left for dead a few<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>times by the man he was supposed to be marking. However, pace has<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>always been the former Roma defender&#39;s Achilles heel and it was cruelly<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>exposed a few times in the wide open spaces of Hampden. Replaced by<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Tommy Johnson on the hour mark. <br><br><b>Paul Lambert</b> (7) -<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Celtic&#39;s best player. Outplayed van Bronckhorst in the middle of the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>park. Unlucky not to open the scoring at the new national stadium when<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his 30-yard effort came crashing back off the crossbar in the first<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>half. Rarely wastes a pass and is one of the few Scots who could walk<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>into any English Premiership side. <br><br><b>Regi Blinker</b> (4) -<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Unpredictable as ever and unable to get much change out of McInnes.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Lucky not to be red-carded for a two- footed lunge on McInnes, the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>little Dutchman was a passenger for the entire match. The occasion<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>seemed too much for him and he was largely anonymous, poor first 45,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>better in the second.<br><br><b>Lubomir Moravcik</b> (5) - Starting only<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his second game after a four-month absence with a hamstring injury, the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Slovak didn&#39;t even look half fit. Playing in a free role behind<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Larsson, he never really got into the game and was a major<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>disappointment. Well marked by McInnes. Looked more sharp as the game<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>continued. <br><br><b>Henrik Larsson</b> (6) - Scotland&#39;s Player of the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Year gave his all but just couldn&#39;t find a way past Hendry and Amoruso.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Had little support up front and the burden of carrying Celtic almost<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>single-handedly for much of the season finally took its toll.

We tried to do our best and I think during the season the team tried to give everything<br>&quot;Today<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>I think we were not the worst team. We had our problems especially with<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>injuries. We had the problem with Vidar but the players who played felt<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>OK.<br>&quot;Football is sometimes like that.<br>&quot; I have no regrets about<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>not playing Mark in the final. If you saw how the game was running,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>there were so many bodies in front of the penalty area it was not for<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>counter-attacking players or those who run at opponents. It was not his<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>game.<br>&quot;There were seven other players left out and I could not speak to all of them. <br>&quot;Maybe<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>if we had been allowed more substitutes he would have been on the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>bench. Maybe the cup organisers should allow more players on the bench.<br>&quot;I<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>am never satisfied, but it was a difficult season. We have a very good<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>team with good players, but nobody can take seve or eight regular<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>players out of a team and hope to win. Next season we will be<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>successful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;When I came here I made an agreement and I am an<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>easy going coach. I am not too easy leaving and I know that we have<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>quality players and I know we will win.<br>&quot;There are two things for us<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>to consider before next season. We need to bring in new players, but<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>also I hope players like Burley, McNamara, Rieper and Johnson are fully<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>fit. That is very important.&quot;<br><br><i>Phil O&rsquo;Donnell</i>:<br>&quot;It was good just to be involved because I hadn&#39;t expected to be stripped. <br>&quot;I was resigned to the fact that our match at Dunfermline three weeks ago had been my last in a Celtic jersey. <br>&quot;I<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>felt for Sid at being left out but it wasn&#39;t just him. Tosh McKinlay,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Harald Brattbakk and Mark Burchill would have felt just as bad. <br>&quot;I<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>know just how bad that feels. When we won the Coca-Cola Cup last season I<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>missed the final through injury after playing in every round leading up<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>to it. <br>&quot;It was an emotional time for me but losing this game<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>overtook everything. When I finally went on all I was hoping for was to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>get that goal we needed. <br>&quot;We had loads of possession in that last half-hour and put Rangers under pressure, but the equaliser just wouldn&#39;t come. <br>&quot;Ultimately we just couldn&#39;t get the wee break we needed. There were a few scrambles and their goalkeeper had a few good saves. <br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t a classic final. The play was a bit scrappy but that was almost to be expected. <br>&quot;Both<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>sets of players were under a lot of pressure after what had happened in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the previous game and that made it a tense affair. <br>&quot;It was the sort of match in which one goal was always likely to be enough. Unfortunately for us, it was Rangers who got it. <br>&quot;Paul<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Lambert was unlucky when he hit the bar in the first half - a couple of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>inches lower and that would have been a great goal. <br>&quot;Neither team played flowing football, though.&quot; <br><br><br><i>Dick Advocaat</i>:<br>&quot;It<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was quite a close game with not many chances. Celtic had to take a few<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>risks in the last 15 minutes and had some opportunities to equalise, but<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>we should already have been 2-0 up. Over the 90 minutes, Rangers<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>deserved to win.<br><span class="diffRemove">  Pictures </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">Match Pictures</span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  <span class="diffRemove">Stats</span><span class="diffRemove">    </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">   </span><b><span class="diffAdd">Celtic 0-1 Rangers </span><a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/355857.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffAdd">[BBC]</span></a><br><span class="diffRemove">   </span><br></b></h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">   </span><span class="diffAdd">Rangers won the first Old Firm Scottish Cup final in 10 years, giving  them a sixth domestic treble and denying </span><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Celtic</span><span class="diffRemove">   </span><span class="diffRemove">   </span><span class="diffRemove">   </span><span class="diffAdd"> a single trophy in a  painful season for the Parkhead club.  </span><br><span class="diffAdd">The Bhoys will consider  themselves unlucky, after creating a number of chances.

All eyes were on referee Hugh Dallas and the players  after the league game at Parkhead saw three dismissals, a missile thrown  at the official and public order problems around Glasgow.  Perhaps as a  result the match started in a subdued atmosphere and the first shot -  from Celtic - did not arrive until the 14th minute.</span><span class="diffFormatting" title="">   </span><br><span class="diffAdd">A pattern of  the side in green and white enjoying more of the ball with Rangers  looking to break was set at this early stage.

A ball was  played into the Celtic box, which McCann managed to turn behind  Wallace&#39;s man-marker Annoni.  The Englishman was six yards out with  Gould to beat, and he made no mistake to score his 27th of a productive  first season in Scotland.  </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Jo Venglos&#39;s side looked like they needed  a change, and the Celtic coach turned to another former Aston Villa man  in a bid to provide Henrik Larsen with more support up front.  Tommy  Johnson, whose time ijn Glasgow has been badly disrupted by injuries,  came on for Annoni.  He did not make an immediate impact although by the  hour mark Celtic were looking more likely to score, with Rangers still  happy to soak up pressure.</span><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><br><b><span class="diffAdd">Half chances</span></b><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><span class="diffAdd">Morten</span><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><span class="diffAdd">Wieghorst, Stephane Mahe and Alan Stubbs all had half chances saved by</span><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><span class="diffAdd">Klos.

Andrei Kanchelskis came on after 77 minutes,  presumably to help Rangers keep the ball when they broke.  And they had a  chance to finish it when Albertz ran down the left after 81 minutes,  but Gabriel Amato&#39;s effort was saved superbly by Gould.  With three  minutes to go a number of shots from the edge of the Rangers area were  charged down and Amoruso eventually deflected Lambert&#39;s long range  effort wide.  Celtic&#39;s fans at the same end of stadium howled for a  penalty but replays showed the ball came off the Italian&#39;s chest for a  corner.  Referee Dallas had got a crucial decision right, and it turned  out to be Celtic&#39;s final real chance of a dispiriting afternoon, despite  almost five minutes of injury time.</span><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">  </span><br><font size="2"><b><span class="diffAdd"> Rangers:</span></b><span class="diffAdd">  Klos, Porrini, Hendry, Amoruso, Vidmar, McCann, McInnes, Van  Bronckhorst, Wallace, Amato, Albertz.
