17th goal of the season, Gary Hooper&rsquo;s 13th and the first of his  entire Celtic career from Mark Wilson buried an Aberdeen side which  played 88 minutes with 10 men after Andrew Considine&rsquo;s red card. No  player has ever been dismissed earlier in a Premier League game. The  Aberdeen defender&rsquo;s foul on Scott Brown resulted in a penalty which  Stokes did not convert but Celtic were not to be denied for long. They  have scored 17 times in four games against Aberdeen this season but  another number feels more significant to them this  morning: eight, the  number of points they are ahead of  Rangers, albeit with three more  games played.<br>What a blitz they  subjected the home side to for most of this sound win. Aberdeen&rsquo;s night  disintegrated while  referee Alan Muir&rsquo;s opening whistle was still  echoing around the ground. Gary Hooper&rsquo;s fine pass picked out Brown and  Considine pulled him down. Muir felt he had denied the Celtic captain a  clear goalscoring opportunity, so the punishment included a straight red  card. Jamie Langfield, the Aberdeen goalkeeper threw himself to his  left to somehow keep out Stokes&rsquo; penalty, and Aberdeen could draw breath  for the first time.<br>Celtic ran them  ragged. If it wasn&rsquo;t Hooper playing with real danger and intelligent  movement, it was Kris Commons continuing his excellent start to life in   Scottish football with a bright, irrepressible display. He unloaded a  number of shots at Langfield and was source of the move for the opening  goal. Commons pressurised Ryan Jack into giving the ball away. The  Celtic man gathered it and fed Hooper, who exchanged a one-two with  Stokes which carved open Aberdeen, Hooper then  tucking a delicious low  finish into the net.<br>Aberdeen were on  the ropes and the loss of David McNamee and Jack to injuries in the 16th  and 18th minutes respectively &ndash; both had to be substituted, with Derek  Young coming on and Steven Smith making his debut &ndash; added to the sense  of chaos engulfing Craig Brown&rsquo;s back four. Through dogged defending and  luck they held on. Rob Milsom cleared a Stokes attempt off the line  after a goalmouth scramble and a sublime Biram Kayal shot from 30 yards  smacked the inside of the far post.<br>It  was an ordeal for  Aberdeen but they dug in, tentatively emerging from  their bunker to create a busy spell at the end of the first half which  had Celtic on the back foot. The league leaders had arrived at Pittodrie  anxious about their central defence. Without Daniel Majstorovic, Thomas  Rogne and Glenn Loovens they had to hammer a couple of men into the  middle from other positions. Brown&rsquo;s reshuffle after  Considine&rsquo;s  dismissal meant the threat to them was quickly reduced. Wilson and  Charlie Mulgrew would have been relieved by that, but Nick Blackman and  Chris Maguire came into the game and com-bined to work Fraser Forster.<br>Celtic  might well have found a response even if Aberdeen had managed an  equaliser, but the visitors&rsquo; play lacked its earlier fluency and during  middle of the match it did not look as though they had any advantage,  let alone a goal and an extra man. There was a spell when their passing  deteriorated and their moves lacked conviction, although Commons should  still have scored when he powered past Smith and Langfield only to knock  his shot on to the outside of the post rather than into the open goal.<br>Still,  that phase passed. By the time Celtic scored twice inside three  second-half minutes the energy and menace was back. Commons&rsquo; corner was  bulleted into the net by Wilson at the near post &ndash; another set-piece  goal conceded, to Brown&rsquo;s despair &ndash; and Aberdeen had barely regrouped by  the time Hooper picked out Stokes for a low shot which exposed  Langfield at his post. The game won, Celtic gave 18-year-old defender  Lewis Toshney his debut. It&rsquo;s all about Hooper, Stokes and Commons right  now though.                                </div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="headline"><h3>     Aberdeen 0-3 Celtic BBC</h3></div>                                                                                                                                   By Keir Murray                                                                             <br>                                                                                                              <b>                            Celtic beat Aberdeen for the third time in 10 days and in doing  so moved eight points clear of Rangers at the top of the Scottish  Premier League.                            </b>                            <br>                            Andrew Considine was sent off within two minutes for fouling  Celtic&#39;s Scott Brown but Jamie Langfield saved Anthony Stokes&#39; resultant  penalty.                             <br>                            Gary Hooper and Stokes combined for two of Celtic&#39;s three goals, the former finishing a one-two for the opener.                             <br>                            Mark Wilson headed a 75th-minute second and Hooper fed Stokes for the third.                                            <div class="bo">                                                      The match could scarcely have begun more dramatically. Dons boss  Craig Brown had just finished shaking hands with his Celtic counterpart  Neil Lennon when Hooper picked out Brown making a run into the box.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      Hooper&#39;s delicious cross-field pass was controlled and nudged  towards goal by the Celtic captain in a flowing move, but as Brown  shaped to score he was hauled down by Andrew Considine and referee Alan  Muir pointed to the spot.                             <br>                            While Stokes grabbed the ball for the penalty, Muir presented  the shell-shocked Dons defender with a red card and his involvement was  over after 95 seconds.                             <br>                            Considine&#39;s foul was apparent but Aberdeen could argue that a  yellow card was sufficient as Zander Diamond was racing across to cover.                              <br>                            Jamie Langfield did not have the best of games against Celtic at  Hampden in the 4-1 Co-operative Insurance Cup semi-final defeat, but he  denied Stokes a penalty goal with a dive to his left - an inspirational  save.                             <br>                            But Celtic could smell blood and they tore the Reds apart in the 12th minute.                             <br>                            Quick-thinking Hooper worked a one-two with strike partner  Stokes, raced past a static Aberdeen defence and slid the ball beyond  Langfield for his 11th Scottish Premier League goal.                             <br>                            Worse was to follow for the home side. Ryan Jack had started the  match in midfield in favour of Derek Young but had moved into defence  with Considine&#39;s sending-off.                             <br>                            Soon he was hobbling off injured at the same time as David  McNamee, who had switched from right- to left-back, was wincing in pain  with a groin injury.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      Brown threw on Derek Young and new loan signing Steven Smith for  the duo as Aberdeen&#39;s decimated defence contemplated a long evening.                             <br>                            Celtic&#39;s Kris Commons had looked lively, firing over the bar  after 10 minutes, and tested Langfield twice more with his left foot in  the first half.                             <br>                            He smacked a first-time shot at the Dons goal that was well  saved in 22 minutes, and 10 minutes later the Aberdeen keeper was down  smartly to his right to turn the former Derby player&#39;s shot round the  post.                             <br>                            The pressure on the Dons goal was constant. Brown blasted a shot  at goal that Zander Diamond blocked with a combination of head then  arm, then Beram Kayal stole into space 25 yards out and curled a  powerful shot around Langfield that cracked off the inside of the post.                             <br>                            Aberdeen&#39;s Rob Milsom cleared off his goal-line with Stokes  ready to pounce before Aberdeen made a late first-half rally.                             <br>                            Nick Blackman had three Celtic players puzzled when he left them  in his wake with a 180-degree turn and shot just wide in 38 minutes,  then Chris Maguire belted a first-time angled volley that stung Fraser  Forster&#39;s palms.                             <br>                            Reaching half-time a goal down was an achievement for Aberdeen.  They would have been level in 42 minutes had Forster not been alert to a  sweet volley by Scott Vernon from eight yards as he connected with a  corner.                             <br>                            While Celtic have been consistent in racking up the SPL points,  their defence has been shorn of any sort of pattern. Efrain Juarez, Mark  Wilson, Charlie Mulgrew and Emilio Izaguirre were in at the back, with  Glenn Loovens, Thomas Rogne and Daniel Majstorovic injured and Darren  O&#39;Dea and Jos Hooiveld out on loan.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      Aberdeen worked hard to limit the chances in the first 20  minutes of the second half; enough, indeed, for Lennon to withdraw Kayal  for Paddy McCourt to try to increase Celtic&#39;s attacking intent.                             <br>                            In 66 minutes the pacy Commons evaded a desperate challenge by  Smith, rounded Langfield then struck the post when he ought to have  rolled the ball into the net.                             <br>                            Wilson&#39;s last goal was five years ago but it was the defender  who eased Celtic&#39;s nerves that they may be stung by Aberdeen when he  rose to meet Commons&#39; in-swinging corner. His powerful header from six  yards gave Langfield no chance at all.                             <br>                            The Dons were three goals down after as many minutes had passed since Wilson&#39;s header.                             <br>                            Hooper was running away from goal in the Aberdeen box but  managed to find his strike partner Stokes, who cut on to his left foot  and shot between Langfield and his near post.                             <br>                            Celtic are unbeaten in 12 league games and are applying pressure to their title rivals.                             </div>                              <div class="bo">                                           </div>                              Story from BBC SPORT:<br> http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9383749.stm<br> <br> Published: 2011/02/01 21:44:04 GMT<br> <br> &copy; BBC 2011<br><br><br><div class="headline"><h3>     Lennon hails strike partnership   </h3></div>                                                                      <b>                            Neil Lennon was full of praise for strike duo Gary Hooper and Anthony Stokes after the 3-0 win at Aberdeen.                            </b>                            <br>                            Both men were on target in a comfortable victory, although Stokes was guilty of missing an early penalty.                             <br>                            &quot;Gary Hooper started the game very well and his goal was a thing of great beauty,&quot; said the Celtic manager.                             <br>                            &quot;He and Anthony feed off each other and there is great  competition between them.
