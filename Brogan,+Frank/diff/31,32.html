He was a chartered accountant by trade.<br><br>The Stepps-born winger was blessed with lightening quick pace and could reportedly run 100 yards in a fraction over 10 seconds. His debut for the Bhoys came in a 1-1 <a href="/page/Glasgow+Charity+Cup" target="_self">Charity Cup</a> final tie with Clyde at Hampden on <span class="diffAdd">9th </span>May <span class="diffRemove">9th</span><span class="diffAdd">1961</span> though it was not until the latter part of the <span class="diffRemove">&#39;61-&#39;62</span><span class="diffAdd">1961-62</span> season that he started to get a regular slot in the first team and even so was constantly switched between outside right and outside left.<br><br>Notable performances included scoring both goals in a 2-0 victory over Aberdeen in the league <span class="diffRemove">Mar</span><span class="diffAdd">in March</span> 1962, and a goal in both the 1-0 win over St Mirren in the Scottish Cup quarter-final and a goal in the 5-2 win over Raith Rovers in the semi-final that took us all the way to final, which was sadly lost in a replay against Rangers.<br><br>However despite some excellent performances Frank <span class="diffAdd">Brogan </span>failed to hold down a regular first team starting spot for long enough. He was a regular for much of the second half of the 1962-63 season taking over from Byrne, but into the next season he was mostly fighting with John Hughes for the same spot in the side and lost out to him.<br><br>He made a total of 48 appearances for the Hoops - and bagged 17 goals - before departing south to Ipswich Town in <a href="/page/1964" target="_self">1964</a> where he was a firm favourite of the support. He was too often out of the Celtic first team as in it, and the then management were not happy with his participation (irony overload). <br><br>Must add that this was a desolate time for the Celtic side. The First Team hadn&#39;t won anything since the classic 1957 League Cup final, and the manager was undermined and totally demoralised by the board. All decisions used to be on the whim of the chairman, and this created a vicious circle that was destroying the side. Into this set-up no player could really do well. Even the Lisbon Lions (to be) who were in the squad at the similar time were seeing their career seriously dented by the environment.<br><br>Despite all the frustrations of the era, he had the great honour to be the Celt to score the landmark 5000th league goal for the club. The 2000th was scored by McLean, 3000th by McGrory and the 4000th by Delaney. So exceptional company to be in.<br><br>In later years, injuries were to be a curse. He missed most of the 1970-71 season with a broken ankle, and tried a come-back with Morton (where he walked out before a match). Then at Halifax, a bone snapping again meant he knew it was time to quit and duly did. He went on to become a coach for junior side Blantyre Celtic.<br><br>Frank <span class="diffAdd">Brogan </span>is the brother of <a href="/page/Brogan%2C+Jim" target="_self">Jim Brogan</a> who had a much more successful career with Celtic in the late 1960&#39;s &amp; early 1970&#39;s. <br><br>Overall, Frank <span class="diffAdd">Brogan </span>had a fair record in returns for goals, so that is much to respect.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1960-64</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  37</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  9</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  48</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals:</td><td align="center" width="16%">13</td><td align="center" width="16%">3</td><td align="center" width="16%">1</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">17</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Honours with Celtic</h3>none (barren years)<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Brogan%2C+Frank+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>Where are they now? Frank Brogan 				 				</h3><div class="newsInfo"> 					By: Joe Sullivan on 17 Jun, 2013 16:01 					<div class="newsShare"> 						 						 						 						<a href="https://twitter.com/share" target="_self">http://www.celticfc.net/news/4154?item=4154</a></div><div class="newsShare"></div></div>OVER the past 12 months, the Celtic View  tracked down some of the club&acute;s unsung heroes to look back on their  career highlights and discover what happened to them after exiting  Paradise.<br><br>So interesting were these stories that, during the  summer, we will be reproducing these interviews on the official website.  Next up is former Celtic winger, Frank Brogan.<br><br>Frank Brogan was  part of the team that pulled the Hoops from the mire of the early 1960s  towards the heights of European glory but a move to Ipswich Town in  1964 saw him miss out on Celtic&rsquo;s treasure trail.<br><br>However, he  did pick up a few gems of his own thanks to his life down south and his  career had moved on a long way since heand brother and fellow-Celt,  Jim, first tested their football skill at St Joseph&rsquo;s in Dumfries, where  Celtic founder Brother Walfrid is buried.<br><br>After completing his  primary education at the boarding school, Frank qualified for St  Mungo&rsquo;s, a noted supplier of Celtic players, and it was there that his  speedy wing play started to turn heads.<br><br>He joined the Hoops  straight from school and after making his debut in 1961, he scored 17  goals in 48 games before leaving for Ipswich in 1964.<br><br>He  finished his career in the early &lsquo;70s with stints at Morton and Halifax  but he will forever be remembered as the Celt who scored the club&rsquo;s  5,000th league goal 50 years ago &ndash; and he returned to Paradise in Hoops&acute;  first league game of last season to donate the ball he scored the goal  with to the club.<br><br>Here, Frank talks about his life and times with Celtic.<br><br>Why did you end up at St Joseph&rsquo;s?<br>My  Dad was a St Mungo&rsquo;s Academy boy and he was taught by the Marists but  when he was playing for St Mungo&rsquo;s FP, he went down for a game at St  Joseph&rsquo;s and I think, secretly, he would have loved to have been a pupil  there. So I think he wanted that for his boys &ndash; but it was a boarding  school and I hated it. Jim loved it but I didn&rsquo;t enjoy it at all &ndash; I  wanted my Mammy!<br><br>You were training to be a Chartered  Accountant and your parents obviously prided themselves in the  education of you and your brother. What was their reaction to you  wanting to take up football?<br>I think my parents gave me  a long rein and let me do what I wanted to do, within reason, as even  when I was 17 or 18-years-old, I had to be in by 10pm. But as far as the  organisation of my own life was concerned, I was given pretty much a  free hand. My parents were both strong-willed and intelligent people but  they realised that Jim and Ijust wanted to play football.<br><br>What role did Jock Stein play at the time?<br>Jock  did a fair bit of coaching with the younger lads that were coming  through and I can remember him taking various training sessions, and  althoughhe had great success with the reserve team, I don&rsquo;t think any  of us thought that things would turn out the way they did. When he got  the freedom to manage in his own way, then things changed. When he came  back to Celtic, things were in such a bad way that Robert Kelly decided  to give fullcontrol to Jock. That was an astute move that turned out to  be fabulous for the club.<br><br>What do you recall of your &lsquo;debut&rsquo; in the Charity Cup final of 1961?<br>I  didn&rsquo;t even know I was playing until I got there, which was maybe a  good thing for a young lad as I would have been 18 at the time. The one  thing I do remember was hitting the post with a shot in the second half  that would have won the cup for us outright instead of sharing it with  Clyde after a 1-1draw. We shared the cup for six months each but I never  got a medal as you couldn&rsquo;t give a player a medal for just six months. I  never got a medal for the Scottish Cup final in 1963 either, as I only  played in the first game and missed out on the replay.<br><br>Then there was your debut proper in the league against Hearts in February, 1962?<br>I  remember that game as it was a good football match. We had just beaten  them 4-3 in the Scottish Cup at Tynecastle a few days earlier. That was a  great game as well as I was in the party and watched it &ndash; there were no  subs in those days. It was 2-2 here and I enjoyed it, I was playing  outside-right against Davie Holt at left-back. I remember turning in  front of The Jungle early on in the game and he came rushing at me. He  was a hard man and I thought, &lsquo;watch out&rsquo; but I just basically stabbed  the ball and it went right through his legs. Then I was around the other  side of him right in front of The Jungle &ndash; that was me made.<br><br>In your sixth league game, your fourth goal for the Celts was the club&rsquo;s 5,000th league goal. How did that feel?<br>It  was a free kick maybe five or 10 yards outside the box and I ran over  the top of the ball. Paddy Crerand pushed it around the wall to the  side, I was in the penalty area by that time and I swivelled on my right  foot and basically just hit it. It just flew into the top left-hand  corner and it was ex-Rangers keeper George Niven who was in goal and  that made it all the sweeter for me.<br><br>You were also  pictured with other milestone scorers, Celtic legends Adam McLean  (2,000th), Jimmy McGrory (3,000th) and Jimmy Delaney (4,000th). Mr  McGrory was manager but how did you feel to be in such exalted company?<br>I  was in their company for only 60 seconds really, but they were Celtic  legends to me, especially McGrory. I mean, how do you score as many  goals as he did? Jimmy Delaney was also a legend and he&rsquo;s the only  player to have won cup winner&rsquo;s medals in Scotland, Ireland and England,  so that speaks for itself. It wasn&rsquo;t until later on that I realised  what a great player Adam McLean was, but I found out he was a true  legend.<br><br>How hard had it been to break into the side?<br>It&rsquo;s  always been heard to break into the first team of a huge club like  Celtic and it will be the same just now for the young lads as was for  myself and Wee Jinky, Bobby Lennox, Bobby Murdoch and so on. It was  difficult and you had to improve and reach a certain standard very, very  quickly. And even that, certainly in my case, wasn&rsquo;t enough at times  because, if your face didn&rsquo;t fit then that was it, or at least that&rsquo;s  the way I see it.<br><br>Appearance-wise, season 1962/63  had been your most fruitful but by the following term, younger brother  Jim was starting to pick up the odd first-team appearance. Was that a  source of family pride?<br>It was, especially for my Mum  and Dad. To have two boys playing for Celtic at the one time was a dream  come true. I can&rsquo;t remember my father ever missing a Celtic game that I  played and that speaks for itself if you&rsquo;re talking about family pride.  It was the same with Jim as when I went down to Ipswich, my father came  down for the odd game but I don&rsquo;t think he missed very many games with  Jim playing for Celtic.<br><br>After 17 goals in 48 games, you moved to Ipswich Town on June 11, 1964. How did that come about?<br>The  reason I moved was basically over money as I wanted my wages to be made  up to the average for the first team. Football contracts ran until June  30 and about 10 days before that I got a phone call from Jimmy McGrory  to go up to Celtic Park. I thought to myself, &lsquo;Great, they&rsquo;re going to  give me the money&rsquo;. So up I went and the boss asked me if I was still of  the same opinion and wouldn&rsquo;t sign for the same terms as the previous  year. I said no and that I wasn&rsquo;t signing for anything less than what I  asked for. He then told me that Ipswich Town manager Jackie Milburn was  up, and Jackie was a legend with Newcastle so I said that I would speak  to him, never believing for a second that I was going to go. Basically, I  didn&rsquo;t want to leave Celtic, all I wanted was four quid &ndash; taking me  from &pound;26-a-week to &pound;30 which was the average wage in the first team at  the time. I spoke to Jackie and apart from being an absolute legend in  the game, he was such a nice man who inspired me with confidence as he  really wanted to sign me. The money I was offered was three times what I  was getting at Celtic Park &ndash; three times! But I still hadn&rsquo;t made up my  mind because I thought I could stay and fight to get my place back in  the team. But I was adamant about the money, I wanted that &pound;4 and I  thought to myself that if they can&rsquo;t give me &pound;4 on trust for being in  and around the first team then there wasn&rsquo;t much hope for the rest of my  career here. All these things were going around in my mind so I went  into Glasgow to meet my father who was a florist at Agnes Brogan  Florist&rsquo;s in Castle Street. He spoke to Jackie and he got on as well  with him as I did and Jackie said, &lsquo;I can see you&rsquo;re in a quandary. I  know what it&rsquo;s like to love a club, Newcastle United were my great  love.&rsquo; So he asked me to come down just to see the place. My father  arranged for me to get a flight down to Heathrow and from there I went  over to Liverpool Street to get the train up to Ipswich.<br><br>What happened next?<br>Jackie  was there waiting for me with a local reporter and photographer to take  me to the stadium. It was a lovely stadium with an absolutely  magnificent pitch. It was so wide, I thought to myself. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to  run amok here - they&rsquo;ll never get near me.&rsquo; It was a beautiful playing  surface with it being in the farming country of Suffolk and it was well  known in England that only Wembley had a better pitch and, of course,  Wembley was only used for a handful of games a year. The Ipswich Town  pitch was immaculate so I hummed and hawed and Jackie did his best. I  met the chairman and I thought, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to go for it.&rsquo; I came back  here once to collect my boots and old trainer Jimmy Gribben had them for  me. He was sorry to see me go and I was sorry to leave him. It was the  same with Sean Fallon who also said he was sorry to see me go and I told  him I had my regrets as well but I had signed now and that was me &ndash; so  off I disappeared into the sunset.<br><br>You then missed out on the Jock Stein years. Did you ever think &lsquo;What if?&rsquo;<br>I&rsquo;ve  asked myself that question so many times but I met my wife down there  and I&rsquo;ve got my two beautiful daughters and my five grandchildren which I  wouldn&rsquo;t have had if I hadn&rsquo;t moved down there so it&rsquo;s swings and  roundabouts really. I had a great time at Ipswich with a good  goal-scoring record. I was well thought of, I was well-respected and it  was a nice quiet place to live so I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;ve any real regrets. On  the football side of things, yes, but on the personal life side of  things &ndash; no.<br><br>Did you watch Jim&rsquo;s career from afar?<br>It  was great to see Jim do so well as in a way it meant that I hadn&rsquo;t  really left as he was filling me in with what was happening when we  talked on the phone. We did that about three or four times a week when I  was telling him about Ipswich and he was telling about what was  happening behind the scenes at Celtic Park.<br><br>Why did you decide to donate the ball back to Celtic?<br>I  spoke to one of the guys from the higher echelons of the supporters&rsquo;  clubs, Alan Horne from Grangemouth. I told him I would like to make a  wee gesture to the club. I actually made up my mind the day that Celtic  hammered Kilmarnock to lift the title and I thought to myself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had  this ball for 50 years so I&rsquo;m going to give it back to the club.&rsquo; Well,  not give it back, but give it to them because they never had it in the  first place, it was Thistle&rsquo;s ball as they were the home side. So I  spoke to Alan and he fixed it up for me to come through and I was  treated like absolute royalty. I couldn&rsquo;t believe how well I was  treated. I was with my grandsons and met Peter Lawwell who introduced me  to the chairman, Ian Bankier, and the other directors. It was nice to  see Big Billy in there and I met Bobby Lennox later on for a wee bit of  patter. They asked me to make a speech at half-tine and I managed to get  through that and then the chairman took me out on to the pitch for the  presentation and I was really happy about the cheer from the crowd. It  was a great day and it was the day after my 70th birthday and I was  having my party on that Saturday night so, all in all, it turned out to  be possibly the greatest weekend of my life<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><br></div>
