At Carrow Road Forster had played an key part in helping the Canaries to the League One title and Lambert was eager to retain his service for the club&#39;s return to the Championship.<br><br>Standing at 6ft 7ins, Forster&#39;s superb performances for Norwich had caught the eye of several would-be suitors, among them Celtic, who now included in their backroom team Alan Thompson who had been a youth team coach at Newcastle.<br><br>The Bhoys had recently lost the highly popular Artur Boruc to Fiorentina and new Hoops boss Neil Lennon appeared unconvinced by Lukasz Zaluska who had taken over as first-choice stopper. Keen to bring in a new No.1, Lennon was linked with a move for the seasoned England international David James who eventually opted for a switch from Portsmouth to Bristol City (much to our good luck).<br><br>However on 24 August 2010 the keeper hunt was over when Forster joined the Hoops initially on a loan deal with later fanfare, and with some whinging as usual of the board taking the cheap short term option. <br><br>Forster made his Celtic debut on 29 August 2010 away at Motherwell and kept a clean sheet as the Bhoys triumphed 1&ndash;0, and it was to be something that marked out his time at Celtic.<br><br>The young Englishman - the tallest player in the SPL - impressed from the off and comfortably retained his starting spot throughout the remainder of the campaign. A superb shot-stopper Forster had perhaps been guilty of the odd positional error, but for the most part he gave the Hoops fans little cause for concern. He was developing and learning, and was ambitious enough.<br><br>A red card in a 2-2 Scottish Cup draw at Ibrox in February was a slight blemish on his record but overall he kept errors to a minimum. At such a young age he was to continue to develop and all were sure that the Scottish Cup he collected in May would be first of many major honours in his career.<br><br>The Celtic actually thought Celtic had lost him back to Newcastle who were not willing to hand him back or sell him, but after persistence, Lennon &amp; his team coaxed Newcastle into loaning him back to the club for another year with an option to purchase at the end for just &pound;2m. Very welcome back he was too.<br><br>The big turning point many would say for Forster came in Dec 2011 v Hearts. Celtic were going through a reasonable patch and Forster was in fine form. Leading one nil with just one minute to, Celtic conceded a needless but disputed penalty. It looked like unnecessarily dropped points, but then Forster brilliantly saved the penalty, our first penalty save since 2008. Finally all rose to pay him the respect he was due and the attention he deserved from the support. It wasn&rsquo;t to be his last and saved a number of penalties in his time at Celtic. He was a valuable asset. <br><br>Fraser Forster gave probably his first blinding performance only a few days later. Playing away to Udinese, little was thought possible for Celtic. Celtic came away with a 1-1 draw which while not enough to put the team through to the next round but gave the squad a big morale boost. This knock-out was in no way in part due to Fraser Forster. He was exceptional with some excellent shop stops from Italian golden boy Di Natale, and even a double stop at one time. Great reflexes and attention from him. He deserved all the plaudits as all stood to applaud him for his performance that night. <br><br>Add to that a week or two later, where he saved a certain goal by Rangers by clearing the ball from the line, he was becoming a bit of a hero. Cracking performances by the man and the season 2011/12 saw him cement the no.1 jersey permanently for himself and the crowd loved him, and finally recognised the gem that the club had brought up.<br><br>After such a huge improvement in his form there were large concern that he would leave the club. The problem was that he had hoped for a chance with the England national side. Taking in how poor they were and the lack in depth they had in practically every position, surely Forster was up in the running. Pathetically he wasn&#39;t picked or really considered for the squad for Euro 2012 (where England performed poorly). <br><br>Forster was thought to wish to move south to increase his chances, but thankfully opted to stay at Celtic much to the relief of a very thankful Celtic support, signing on for &pound;2m on 29 June 2012. Our great gain and Newcastle&#39;s loss as became quite clear as Forster&#39;s performances were to show with the universal praise along with it. In time, the Newcastle fans were to complain vociferously of how the club could have let go of such a talent even though at the time they laughed at him.<br><br>At home he was peerless, but despite being overlooked foolishly at the international level, he was to be given the exposure he deserved in the Champions League and he proved himself beyound doubt. His performance v Barcelona in the two matches in the 2013/14 season, were amongst the finest anywhere that season, pulling off some wonder saves. He was rightly rewarded with further praise and Spanish papers began rumours of a bid in for him from Barcelona. He was dubbed as &#39;<i>La Grande Muralla</i>&#39; (The Great Wall) by the Spanish Press in his honour. <br><br>Lionel Messi never forgot that performance and remarked a few years later highly on Fraser Forster:<br><blockquote>  <i>&ldquo;The performances of Fraser Forster against us were talked about for a long time. There was one game in Scotland where he was not human, it is the best goalkeeping performance I have seen. When Victor Valdes said he was leaving we even talked about him playing here. I was sure he would end up at Arsenal, Chelsea, or Manchester United.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>He was showing his best. He had quick reflexes, great bravery and was improving in marshalling the defence. Additionally, his kicking was improving which was something that in earlier seasons was a weakness.<br><br>In the league, he was the bulwark in the side that created a formidable record of clean sheets, breaking former Aberdeen keeper Bobby Clark&#39;s 43-year-old record. If anything, the incredible run was only going to end with a bang, and that was duly delivered by (ironically) Aberdeen in Feb 2014 with a thunderbolt of a shot from outside the box. They duly scored twice to defeat Celtic 2-1. Fraser Forster&#39;s clean-sheet run ends at 1,256 minutes, and a 27 game unbeaten run.<br><br>Overall, it was an inspiring and exceptional spell. Some critics may have tried to undermine it with the usual negative responses, but they were best laughed off. Forster saved Celtic often in matches, and his massive frame was an intimidating sight for any approaching striker.<br><br>The long dry spell for the defense admittedly was not due to one man alone, and the defensive unit in season 2012/13 will become one of the most celebrated Celtic have ever had. However, Forster was the lynchpin, and he had executed some exceptional saves in this spell that alone in any single game would be remembered. He had truly developed into a formidable goalkeeper, and one that could be labelled as world class (not that the England setup were paying him the due respect). <br><br>On a personal note, the England no.1 spot was a bugbear as that was a personal key aim. He&#39;d achieved so much already with Celtic: medals, trophies, honorary place in UEFA Champions League team of the week multiple times and so on. The international spot was the missing piece, with the at times hapless Joe Hart in that role. <br><br>Finally he was awarded an England cap on 15th Nov 2013 in an England friendly v Chile. They lost two nil having fielded a mainly second string team, and pathetically Forster had to play behind a woeful defence. Yet he was given unwarranted flak by many of England&#39;s Barmy Army supporters, it was pathetic. &#39;<i>The Times</i>&#39; newspaper and some other more respected analysts though gave him a glowing report, so much respect to them. <br><br>He was finally &#39;rewarded&#39; as part of the England squad that went to Brazil for the World Cup in 2014. Yet despite a pathetic campaign the England management did not play Forster. He deserved a game, it was a disgrace that he was sidelined.<br><br>As a person, he never created any problems off field, and if you ever see the pictures of Forster with the celebrated Thai Tims, you&#39;ll see just what a top guy he was. The kids loved him and vice versa, and he was a great role model for all.<br><br>Sadly, his last competitive matches were the humiliating 6-1 aggregate defeat games in the Champions League 3rd round to Legia Warsaw. Granted, the second match score was reversed and Celtic won on the away goals rule (4-4). Forster conceded many goals but he wasn&rsquo;t wholly responsible, and he actually saved a penalty in the first match. He deserved to sign off with a better scoreline and moment to say farewell. A terrific footballer who developed strongly at the club, and one that we hope all will learn to replicate. <br><br>He moved to Southampton after four years at Celtic for &pound;10m. A level we all believed was below his full value. Breaking into the bloated arrogant mega-clubs is not an easy move, but we all knew he could make it in time.<br><br>A great Celtic player, and one of the finest goalkeepers Celtic have ever had. It&#39;s a mark of pride that we saw him develop from a junior to a great success at Celtic. We believed in him, and he repaid the club all back in full on the pitch.<br><br>Fraser Foster: <i>&quot;I am a Celtic supporter for life and will be cheering the club on in everything they do.&quot;<br><br></i>We wished him all the best.<br><br><b>Southampton Playing Career</b><br><div>His time at Southampton was mixed. He was a regular for a few years, punctuated by a loss of time due to a knee injury. During that time he made a great contribution to the side with plenty of plaudits, and went on to win a handful of caps. However, his form slipped and after a poor match v Tottenham Hotspurs in December 2017, he was relegated in the pecking order.</div><div></div><div><br>Pathetically, Southampton put him up for sale in July 2018 on the same day that England were to play Croatia in the World Cup semi-finals in Russia. Taking in that Forster, give or take a few changes in circumstances, could have or should have been one of the squad members (and even the no.1 England goalkeeper), then this was a major blow &amp; a bit of an insult. You could argue it was done to time to hide the announcement. His many supporters would have very much sympathised with him, and he deserved better. <br><br>He was touted by the best only a couple of years earlier, and now his current treatment by his club was cold-hearted &amp; poor.</div><br><b>Celtic Second Stint</b><img align="right" alt="Forster, Fraser - Pics - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/96b5a00d5fc106d9f3ab28b5f1dd392c" title="Forster, Fraser - Pics - The Celtic Wiki"><br> 		 	With Celtic faltering at the start of the 2019/20 season, and Lennon having returned as manager, Fraser Forster was drafted back to Celtic as a loan goalkeeper in August 2019.

But they should at least learn to love what they&rsquo;ve got. In concluding a deal to take the 6ft 7in Fraser Forster on a season-long loan from Newcastle United yesterday, the Parkhead club effectively landed Shay Given&rsquo;s younger, taller, protege. The 22-year-old, who hails from Hexham in Northumberland, has yet to make a first-team appearance for his boyhood heroes Newcastle United. <br><br>But he has spent some 50 matches on the St James&rsquo; Park bench, and feels he has learned from the best in the form of Given, his fellow veteran Steve Harper, and the former Celtic goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe. &ldquo;He [Given] was here as a kid and obviously he was fantastic to learn from at Newcastle,&rdquo; Forster said yesterday. &ldquo;He has moved on to new things, and is a bit unlucky to lose his place. But no doubt he will fall on his feet. <br><br>You just learn so much from watching him. In fact, it was like having three goalkeeper coaches.&rdquo; These days Forster hopes to do his learning on the job. Big things are expected of a player who becomes the tallest player currently active in the SPL, and the tallest player in the club&rsquo;s 128-year history. Not least from Paul Lambert &ndash; the man who took him on a productive season-long loan to Norwich City this time last summer and tried to take him back to East Anglia this season only to be thwarted by an accumulation of injuries at Newcastle, and Chris Hughton&rsquo;s desire to keep him during pre-season. Lambert eventually ended up with former Motherwell goalkeeper John Ruddy, but he would have preferred to have kept Forster. <br><br>No wonder. In its entirety, his 2009-10 campaign saw him make 42 appearances &ndash; four of which were in an early season loan spell at Bristol Rovers &ndash; with no fewer than 22 ending in clean sheets. The former Celtic midfielder was one of the first people Forster phoned when the move started to come together. <br><br>&ldquo;Paul was spot on with me,&rdquo; Forster said. &ldquo;He looked after me when I needed looking after and filled everyone with so much confidence to go and play for him. And obviously we won the title. I spoke to him twice last week, including on Saturday night. He obviously told me a lot about the club and said I should get straight up there and sign the papers. He was a fantastic player for Celtic so it was a massive recommendation.&rdquo; Lambert has even appeared in certain newspapers in the last few days predicting his former player could use his Parkhead powerbase to infiltrate the England squad. It is not as outlandish as it seems. <br><br>With Paul Robinson retiring in disgust, Robert Green out of favour, and David James at down-at-heel Bristol City, Fabio Capello turned to unknowns Scott Loach, of Watford, and Frankie Fielding, of Blackburn Rovers, for the recent friendly against Hungary. Chris Sutton and Alan Thompson used their time at Celtic as a springboard for international caps, and things could yet go the same way for Forster. Not that he is the type to have his head in the clouds. <br><br>Metaphorically at least. &ldquo;The only way talk about England can happen is if I can perform for Celtic,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never been involved at any level but it is every player&rsquo;s dream to play for their country. Some are lucky. A lot aren&rsquo;t. It is all about working hard and proving myself here. If I do that it&rsquo;s up to someone else whether they want to pick me or not. But you want to test yourself,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like playing for a team that&rsquo;s doing well and in front of a crowd. <br><br>That is what I hope to do here.&rdquo; His three loan spells to date &ndash; Stockport County, Bristol Rovers and then Norwich &ndash; mean Forster is no stranger to usurping a previously settled incumbent. <br><br>Lukasz Zaluska may be the man in possession at Parkhead, but his short-lived loan spell at Bristol Rovers saw him unseat club captain Steve Phillips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always strange when you turn up as a goalkeeper,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is always someone already in that position. It&rsquo;s all about being ruthless.&rdquo; It isn&rsquo;t just Lambert who Forster has made an impression on. Alan Thompson, his former reserve coach at Newcastle, helped facilitate the deal, and at Norwich his team-mates made him player of the year. <br><br>The award was presented by Delia Smith. &ldquo;She was delighted for me,&rdquo; Forster recalled. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nice for someone like that who has put a lot of money into a club when it all comes together.&rdquo; Recipe for success or not, at 6ft 7in Forster will be hard to miss. He says there are &ldquo;pros and cons&rdquo; to having such height but he &ldquo;works hard on the training pitch to make everything a pro&rdquo;. He actually became a goalkeeper at the age of 13, but didn&rsquo;t undergo his growth spurt till 15 or 16. <br><br>&ldquo;I just started growing and kept on growing. I haven&rsquo;t seemed to stop.&rdquo; He could be a big signing if his personal development continues this season. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div>  <h3>  Celtic&#39;s Fraser Forster can command a fee if he can learn to command his box</h3>Richard Wilson   <br>The Herald<br><br>One penalty save will not eradicate all of the doubts, but the sudden acclaim of Fraser Forster at the end of last Saturday&#39;s victory over Hearts seemed a reflection of his growing worth.<br><br>He was a goalkeeper in need of appreciation, at least from the broad extent of the Celtic support, and his reaction to securing the 1-0 win was a surge of emotion. Forster roared, as if liberated.<br><br>In his second season at Parkhead, and in the fifth loan spell of his career, he is seeking stability. There is a clause in the agreement between his parent club, Newcastle United, and Celtic that allows this current move to be made permanent for a &pound;2m fee. Having had a &pound;1.5m offer rejected last summer, and watched his development continue, Celtic might now consider that the price offers value for money.<br><br>At 23, there will still be moments of rashness from Forster, and he remains reluctant to use his broad 6ft 7in frame to dominate his area. Opposition strikers do not cower from him, but he is a capable shot stopper, as his penalty save from Eggert Jonsson last Saturday proved. There was also an act of devilment, since he protested at the positioning of the ball on the penalty spot, and so applied some extra psychological pressure to the Hearts midfielder.<br><br>This element of his game, a brash authority, continues to be mostly absent, though. Forster needs to be the dominant figure in Celtic&#39;s defence, imposing his command on the back four. When Neil Lennon was asked to identify the best goalkeeper he played alongside, he immediately responded, &quot;Artur Boruc&quot;. The Pole was a compelling mix of arrogance, brawn, assurance and talent, who was also quick to lambast any team-mates who made a mistake in defence. &quot;I like a goalkeeper to dominate his back four and take great delight in getting after them to keep them on their toes,&quot; Lennon explained.<br><br>Forster kept 24 clean sheets last season, a record, and four in his last five games. Yet he is not an imposing presence, even if physically he towers over players. The domineering attitude will come with age, and what best serves the goalkeeper in his formative years is a strong mentality. Despite a mix-up with Cha Du-Ri that led to Rennes scoring in France last October, Forster went on to make several impressive saves in the game. He will commit further errors as he develops and, particularly at a high-profile club such as Celtic, where success is measured in trophies won, he cannot succumb to any self-doubt.<br><br>&quot;As long as it&#39;s the occasional mistake, but that&#39;s the case with Fraser,&quot; says Bryan Gunn, the former Aberdeen and Norwich City goalkeeper who watched Forster closely during his loan spell at Carrow Road. &quot;Fraser&#39;s done very well at recovering and that&#39;s the attribute that all the top goalkeepers have. You get on to the next part of the game and wipe it away from your memory. At Norwich he was fantastic and some of the saves he made helped them win the league. When John Ruddy took over the following season, he found it difficult because Fraser had set such high standards.&quot;<br><br>With his height and the long reach of his limbs, Forster can seem ungainly. Following Celtic&#39;s 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the Europa League two weeks ago, the goalkeeper was described in the Spanish press as having &quot;the grace of an elephant&quot;. The depiction was cruel, since Forster can move swiftly for such a tall figure, but there remains a separation between perceptions of him and his true potential.<br><br>After Forster&#39;s season-long loan at Norwich, Paul Lambert identified him as the best young goalkeeper he had seen in his career, claimed that he would be &quot;world class&quot; and could one day play for England. The plaudits were generous after a campaign in League One, but there is time enough for Forster to prove the observations authentic. The penalty save from Jonsson will renew his confidence, and Lennon already detected a more aggressive, formidable attitude in the goalkeeper&#39;s display at Celtic Park.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a confidence position and the more times that you come off the pitch having kept a clean sheet and made important saves, receiving plaudits from sponsors and the press, the more confident you become,&quot; says Gunn. &quot;That makes you play better and as a young goalkeeper, Fraser will be inspired on to bigger and better things. He&#39;s got the physical attributes, an excellent build, and maybe there&#39;s a bit of youthfulness there. He&#39;s still learning his trade. It&#39;s a great experience for him as a young goalkeeper, playing at a high level with Celtic. Fraser needs to decide now where his future lies. He&#39;s done very well in his time at Celtic and he&#39;ll need to think about his career and what his next move will be.&quot;<br><br>Forster wants his next move to be permanent, so that he can settle down and establish roots somewhere. If his preference might have been Newcastle, having grown up in Hexham as a supporter of the club, he has not played a single competitive first-team game during his six years at St James&#39; Park. It is at Celtic that Forster is fulfilling his potential, and it would suit both the player and the club to extend their relationship.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Boss cares about me.. that&rsquo;s why I knew I&rsquo;d be staying put at Celts</h3>Fraser Forster talks to Derek McGregor   <br>The Sun<br>2 July 2012<br><br>In safe hands ...

There&rsquo;s always speculation, but in my mind I felt I&rsquo;d end up back at Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very happy that I&rsquo;m going to be at Celtic for the next four years at least.<br><br>&ldquo;We won the league last season and it&rsquo;s important we aim to keep on improving, individually and collectively.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  Forster: After the 18 months I had I will never be able to put into words how good that (Lazio) felt<br></h3>   <br>Date: 3rd November 2019 at 7:50pm<br>Written by: Joe McHugh<br>https://videocelts.com/2019/11/blogs/latest-news/forster-after-the-18-months-i-had-i-will-never-be-able-to-put-into-words-how-good-that-lazio-felt/<br>On the surface his career could hardly be in a better place right now but Fraser Forster is carrying a few issues.<br><br>A year ago, Southampton were losing 6-1 at Manchester City with Alex McCarthy in goals and Angus Gunn on the bench. The same duo was in place yesterday with McCarthy back in favour after Gunn lost nine goals at home to Leicester City.<br><br>Forster was Southampton&rsquo;s first choice keeper during the 2017/18 season right up until a 5-2 defeat to Spurs on December 26. After that he made just one more EPL appearance with &pound;10m paid for Gunn as the giant Geordie dropped from being third choice keeper for England at the 2014 World Cup to third choice keeper at Southampton.<br><br>Mauricio Pelligrini was the manager at the time, Mark Hughes followed him before Ralph Hasenhuttl took charge with Forster firmly off the menu.<br>ADVERTISING<br><br>Throughout a career that has taken him to the heights of European football and international recognition the big keeper has been nothing but a model professional, happier on the training ground than in the headlines and spotlight.<br><br>After more than 18 months bereft of playing time the breakthrough came with a move to Celtic, in his second match he kept a clean sheet in the Glasgow derby at Ibrox and it seemed just like the old days again.<br><br>Yesterday it was a Betfred Cup semi-final, on Thursday it&rsquo;s a Europa League tie against Lazio with Forster back in the firing line and appreciating every minute.<br><br>I got to speak to him at Hampden yesterday, while enjoying the return to action there was a recurring feeling of frustration at lost time in his career. He&rsquo;ll discuss that in his own time but as he enjoys being back in action, doing his job again there is clearly a sense of hurt over whatever went on at Southampton.<br><br>Joe McHugh: Somehow the League Cup evaded you first time around, you&rsquo;ll be looking to put that right?<br><br>Fraser Forster: It would mean the world to me. When you come here you are expected to do well and win trophies. I&rsquo;m enjoying every game; it would be good to add a League Cup to the collection but that&rsquo;s on the back burner because we have a lot of important matches coming up.<br><br>JM: Where was your career a year ago?<br><br>FF: Obviously I wasn&rsquo;t playing, I was frustrated. I didn&rsquo;t know what was going on, a lot of other people didn&rsquo;t know what was going on. It&rsquo;s been and gone, I&rsquo;m here at Celtic and trying to make the most of it.<br><br>JM: Confidence is so important in sport; how did you retain your confidence?<br><br>FF: I always had a belief in my quality and what I had to offer. I never doubted my quality. I went in every day to do my best in training.<br><br>I just concentrated on what I could control, I went in, I knew what was going on behind the scenes. I&rsquo;ve said that when the time is right, the situations I was put in, the stuff I had to do, I will speak about that when I want to speak about it.<br><br>I just put my head down, worked harder than ever, concentrated on what I could offer, trained as hard as I could and tried to be good around the lads, that&rsquo;s all I could do.<br><br>JM: Were there other options apart from Celtic in the summer?<br><br>FF: There was a bit of interest during the summer but as soon as there was a sniff of interest from Celtic, I was desperate for it to happen.<br><br>JM: When did you hear of Celtic&rsquo;s interest?<br><br>FF: There are two very good keepers here, it all happened very quickly in the end after Scott Bain got injured, as soon as I got a sniff about that I was desperate to get back and do whatever to make it happen.<br><br>I was in the car within 10 seconds of hearing from Celtic, straight up the motorway, it was a no-brainer for me. After the year I had last year I just wanted to go somewhere that I felt the love. That was the big thing for me, I just wanted to go somewhere that I was wanted and that was it. I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get back, it was a fantastic club with amazing people, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get back and be a part of it.<br><br>JM Did the Lazio match have similarities to the Barcelona game in 2012?<br><br>FF What was nice about the Lazio game, I&rsquo;d never compare it to any other, was the way that the lads played to get the win. People talk about money and whatever in football but the feeling after the Lazio game is why we are in it, why we play football. Given the 18 months that I&rsquo;d had before that as well, I&rsquo;ll never be able to put it into words how good that felt. It was nice.<br><br>All the best to Fraser in Rome and the remainder of his stay with Celtic  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  <br></h3><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  <br></h3><br><br></div></div>
