Honduras is plagued by gang violence and has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Peralta had complained about violence in his homeland in a tweet late last year.

Still got some serious problems, the continued  persistance of that Johansen in the team, poor form of Armstrong, lack  of ability of Cifcti, the dallying of Bitton, Gordon being a big  shampooebag and add in our usual calamitous defensive error we at least  showed some balls to come back and get a draw. Yes, it&#39;s against ten men  but I don&#39;t look at that as a negative at all. <br><br>I thought the subs we put on were right and at the right time for a change also. <br><br>However,  the glacial pace at which we pay. It&#39;s awful, once it went to 10 men we  can&#39;t shake ourselves out of the crab football we&#39;ve lapsed into. <br><br>There&#39;s  a nucleus of decent players in that team I just cannot see it being  nurtured or improved under Deila as a manager.

Craig Fowler gives his take on the performance of  each player in green and white.</div></h3><div class="spoiler_toggle">Spoiler: click to toggle</div>GK &ndash; Craig Gordon &ndash; 3<br><br>Prior  to his mistake this match seemed poised to host a vintage Gordon  performance. He made an excellent fingertip stop at his front post to  deny Diego and looked confident when coming for cross balls.<br><br>Then  he let Markovic dribble the ball through his legs with little effort on  the part of the attacker. He didn&rsquo;t have much to do after that, but the  damage was done.<br><br>RB &ndash; Mikael Lustig &ndash; 8<br><br>In a team full of  chronic underachievers in Europe this season, Lustig has flown under  the radar somewhat. However, this was more like the old Lustig, the man  Celtic fans pined for during his lengthy injury spells.<br><br>He was  strong in defence and helped out whenever he could in attack, including  the cross for Kris Commons to head the visitors level.<br><br>CB &ndash; Dedryck Boyata &ndash; 8<br><br>This  type of performance is what Celtic were missing in the early group  stage games. Aside from one hairy moment when he dribbled himself, and  his team, into trouble 25 yards from his own goal, he was solid, both in  defence and with the football.<br><br>His enthusiasm to charge forward led to the goal as it pulled the Fenerbahce defence out of sorts and freed Lustig on the right.<br><br>CB &ndash; Jozo Simunovic &ndash; 8<br><br>Like  Boyata, he too gave supporters a scare on one occasion, but otherwise  it was a polished defensive performance. In particular he stood up well  to the challenge of Fernand&atilde;o, who he thwarted all by himself on more  than one occasion.<br><br>LB &ndash; Kieran Tierney &ndash; 7<br><br>This was  arguably the left-back&rsquo;s weakest performance since breaking into the  Celtic line-up. Part of that was him being curtailed on the attacking  front, since Celtic were forced to sit back, and partly because the  opposition finally started to cause him problems. Having said that, it  was still a positive showing with a couple of key interceptions, and he  continued to be strong in the tackle.<br><br>DM &ndash; Nir Bitton &ndash; 6<br><br>There  were occasions where he showed his undoubted close control and  composure on the football, and then there were times when he would  concede possession so needlessly. His early pass through to Nadir Ciftci  was a high point in the game for him, and it deserved to lead to a  goal.<br><br>DM &ndash; Stefan Johansen &ndash; 5<br><br>The injury to Brown, along  with the emergence of Tom Rogic and Scott Allan returning to fitness,  means we&rsquo;ll likely see more of Johansen in the defensive midfield role,  though there is no doubt it isn&rsquo;t his strongest position.<br><br>On  occasion he was weak in the tackle and would often get his team-mates  into trouble with ill-advised passes. That said, he still worked hard  all over the park and often remained cool with the football in the face  of pressure.<br><br>MR &ndash; Callum McGregor &ndash; 7<br><br>Arguably had the  best showing of Celtic&rsquo;s starting attackers. His strong running with the  football helped ease the pressure on occasion as he dragged his  team-mates up the field, even if the final ball was lacking. Defensively  he put in a power of work and it&rsquo;s telling that he remained on the  field for the full 90 minute while three of the remaining, and more  experienced, midfielders went off.<br><br>AMC &ndash; Scott Allan &ndash; 5<br><br>This  wasn&rsquo;t the game for Allan to show Celtic fans and his manager what he&rsquo;s  capable of. The playmaker, from his time in the Championship with  Hibernian, is used to starring in a side with plenty of the football.  Tonight he was asked to provide the spark on a team forced to sit-in for  long periods.<br><br>When he got the ball his touch was a little rusty  and he was closed down quickly. The reverse pass through for Ciftci  (that just carried a little too far) demonstrated the vision that will  become a key weapon with more playing time.<br><br>ML - Stuart Armstrong - 5<br><br>Typical  Armstrong performance in a Celtic shirt. Showed his enthusiasm,  athleticism and energy with and without the ball, but didn&rsquo;t do enough  to impact the play in the opposition half. He was deservedly the first  away player to be subbed off.<br><br>FC &ndash; Nadir Ciftci &ndash; 5.5<br><br>The  only one to get a half-mark. That&rsquo;s because this writer was stuck  between wishing to reward the player for an improved display or facing  up to the reality of the performance.<br><br>He&rsquo;s still got to show a  lot more if he&rsquo;s going to have a future at Celtic, but there were little  glimpses of the star who dazzled fans at Dundee United for two seasons.  Still severely lacks confidence in front of goal but at least looked  defiant by trying to get into dangerous areas.<br><br>Substitutes<br><br>James Forrest &ndash; 7<br><br>Had  he been fit he likely would have started over Armstrong. His ability to  run at opposing full-backs, scaring the life out of them, has a real  galvanising effect on the rest of his team. They seem to feed off his  energy. As per usual, his final ball wasn&rsquo;t quite there, but he remains  an asset to the team regardless.<br><br>Tom Rogic &ndash; 6<br><br>The  quietest of the three substitutes but another who impacted proceedings  in a positive manner. Even when he&rsquo;s not influencing play in the final  third, his skill and quick feet allow him to move attacks along before  defenders can put him under pressure, thus opening space for others.<br><br>Kris Commons &ndash; 8<br><br>With  Fenerbache down to 10 men, there was an expectation something would  happen when the veteran emerged on the touch-line, ready to be brought  on.<br><br>He remains Celtic&rsquo;s most potent goal threat outside of Leigh  Griffiths. Whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or a bad thing, you can decide.<br><br>Read more: <a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/fenerbahce-1-1-celtic-celtic-player-ratings-1-3972671#ixzz3tzdteTOr" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/fenerbahce-1-1-celtic-celtic-player-ratings-1-3972671#ixzz3tzdteTOr</a><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>BBC<br>Celtic could face further sanctions from UEFA after travelling fans set  off flares during last night&rsquo;s 1-1 draw in Turkey against Fenerbahce.<br><br>Since  2011, Celtic have been in trouble with UEFA on seven occasions &ndash;

this season.<br><br>However, Deila said: &quot;I think that frightened is the wrong word; it&#39;s experience that&#39;s important.<br><br>&quot;You need to play games like we did (against Fenerbahce) with a different atmosphere and way of playing.&quot;<br><br>Despite drawing 1-1 in Istanbul, Celtic finished bottom of Group A and without a win from their campaign.<br><br>&quot;We obviously need to try more - we look a bit afraid when it comes to the pressure,&quot; Johansen told BBC Scotland.<br><br>&quot;Hopefully we can get that off our shoulders and play better next year.&quot;<br><br>Johansen accepts the youthful Celtic squad need to acquire more nous for the rigors of European football.<br>Paul Brennan, Celtic blogger<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a very big concern. Celtic really have to be hitting Champions League football regluarly. His [Ronny Deila&#39;s] failures to do that in the first two seasons and lack of progress in the Europa League group stages this season really counts against him.<br><br>&quot;Apologies count for nothing. There has to be a big decision to be made. If we have significant plans for the transfer window and the club have faith in those then my expectation is he will be given January and the second half of this season to see where he takes the club.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is behind us now and we can&#39;t dig ourselves into the ground.

We just haven&#39;t been good enough in Europe.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;re a top quality side with good players, but I think we showed we have the work-rate back.<br><br>&quot;We were compact as a team and we didn&#39;t give them many chances. Of course the passing could be better but we will work on that.&quot;<br><br>Arriving back in Glasgow on Friday, Deila said focus returned to domestic matters and Sunday&#39;s trip to St Johnstone.<br><br>&quot;Sunday is maybe going to be one of the hardest games and we&#39;re going to fight hard for those points,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s too early to talk about the treble with so many games to play.
