A few days prior to this match, the wonderful Oscar Knox died at just the age of five.

Very  emotional with the tribute to wee Oscar at the start and big Samaras  showing a real touch of class by taking the wee guy onto the pitch with  him. Same for our manager giving up his medal, yet another example of  the difference between us and anybody else.<br><br>The &#39;plane with the banner was a massive GIRUY to the non-Celtic minded in the vicinity.<br><br>All in all a very well executed celebration, hopefully many more to follow.<br><br>Edit.  Also meant to add that the boys entering the half-time competition  weren&#39;t given much of a chance. The ball wasn&#39;t allowed to bounce before  it entered the boot of the car. Not one of them even got it anywhere  near the car never mind in the boot. Poor stuff from the organisers.  						 						 						<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="2014-05-11: Celtic 3-1 Dundee United, SP - Pic" height="533" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/wYAkCg8YVrsOxNzbUcchHQ104585/GW800H533" title="2014-05-11: Celtic 3-1 Dundee United, SP -

Griffiths had the ball in the net two minutes later but the flag was up for an infringement.<br><br>Mackay-Steven replaced Ryan Gauld on the hour mark and there was a big cheer from the home fans seconds later for Samaras when he came on for Griffiths.<br><br>Commons came close when he had a powerful effort saved at the near post by Cierzniak but moments later it was the Hoops top scorer who put a cross on to the head of Stokes to head past the United keeper from six yards for his 21st of the season.<br><br>The goal relaxed the champions and they went looking for number two, Cierzniak again making a good save from Commons, before Forster had to dive low to his right to push a shot from Armstrong, on for Dow, past the post.<br><br>Samaras got his chance for a leaving present when was brought down by Cierzniak and he coolly sent the United keeper the wrong way with the spot-kick.<br><br>Three minutes later the unfortunate Twardzik put through his own goal trying to cut out a cross from Mackay-Steven, who had been sent to the byeline by Armstrong, but there was no real chance of a comeback.<br><br>With eight minutes remaining, and the United defence all over the place, Stokes set up Commons who calmly knocked the ball past Cierzniak for number three, and the celebrations began in earnest.  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br>By Roddie McVake BBC Scotland<br><br>Celtic broke through the 100-goals mark as they cruised past Dundee United on the day Neil Lennon&#39;s side were presented with the Premiership trophy.<br><br>Anthony Stokes nodded the opener before Georgios Samaras doubled the hosts&#39; lead from the penalty spot, having been brought down by Radoslaw Cierzniak.<br><br>A Filip Twardzik own goal reduced Dundee United&#39;s deficit.<br><br>But Kris Commons restored the two-goal cushion with a fine finish following a slip by Keith Watson.<br>Celtic striker Georgios Samaras<br><br>Samaras made a scoring appearance on what is likely to be his last game for Celtic<br><br>The Celtic players took to the field wearing black armbands in memory of five-year-old fan Oscar Knox, who lost his battle with cancer this week, and applause rang around the ground after five minutes as a tribute.<br><br>There was a distinct end-of-season feel to the opening exchanges, with plenty of free-flowing football on show but little threat in either final third.<br><br>Dundee United will be back at Celtic Park next week for their Scottish Cup final date with St Johnstone, and Jackie McNamara&#39;s side looked comfortable in the surroundings.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s first sight of goal fell to Leigh Griffiths from a fine Scott Brown pass, but with the ball dropping over his shoulder, the hitman produced a fresh-air swipe.<br><br>Stokes then had a dig from the edge of the box but it lacked power and United goalkeeper Cierzniak gathered easily.<br><br>At the other end Paul Paton tried his luck, curling an effort over the bar from 20 yards after tenacious play from Morgaro Gomis.<br><br>The best chance of the opening hour fell to United front man Farid El Alagui five minutes after the break.<br><br>Mark Wilson fired an effort that Fraser Forster saved, and when the ball dropped to El Alagui a few yards out, he shot over with the goal gaping.<br><br>Minutes later Griffiths had the ball in the net after latching on to Stefan Johansen&#39;s through ball, but the flag was up for offside.<br><br>United&#39;s Ryan Gauld made way for Gary Mackay-Steven on the hour and Samaras, whose Celtic deal ends this summer, came on in place of Griffiths.<br>Anthony Stokes socres for Celtic against Dundee United<br><br>Stokes (third from left) opened the scoring with a header past Cierzniak<br><br>And Stokes made the breakthrough after 64 minutes, netting the club&#39;s 100th league goal of the campaign.<br><br>Commons was the creator, working the ball on to his right foot and delivering to the back post where the Irishman was waiting to nod beyond Cierzniak.<br><br>Ryan Dow went off for United and his replacement, Stuart Armstrong, almost made an immediate impact. El Alagui set him free down the left with an excellent header and the midfielder cut inside before drilling in a low effort, but Forster got down brilliantly to tip it round the post.<br><br>The hosts then doubled their lead from the penalty spot.<br><br>Samaras picked Gavin Gunning&#39;s pocket in the box with a fine sliding challenge and Cierzniak hauled the Greek to the ground. The forward then got to his feet and easily beat the goalkeeper from 12 yards, netting his first league goal at Celtic Park this season.<br><br>The two-goal cushion was short-lived, though, as United got back into the game thanks to a Twardzik own goal.<br><br>Mackay-Steven was played in down the right by Armstrong and his attempted centre was diverted past Forster by the Czech.<br><br>Celtic bagged another goal immediately through Commons&#39; delicate finish after Keith Watson slipped and gifted possession to Stokes.<br><br>Substitute Beram Kayal missed a glaring chance as Celtic poured forward in search of more goals, but it mattered little as soon the title party ensued.<br><br><br><br><br>Celtic boss Neil Lennon hopes to add new faces in summer<br>BBC<br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon hopes to bolster his Premiership-winning squad this summer to boost their bid to make an impact in the Champions League.<br><br>Virgil van Dijk and Fraser Forster have been two of Celtic&#39;s stand-out performers this season and have been linked with moves away from the club.<br><br>But Lennon is hoping to hang on to his star names and bring in some new faces.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got some good players here, ideally you want to build on that now and add to it,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;At the end of the day, the Champions League is where we really want to be and the experience they&#39;ve had this season will stand them in good stead going forward.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll probably sit down with Peter [Lawwell, chief executive] and John [Park, scout] in the middle of next week and start really planning things and looking at options we have.&quot;<br>Kris Commons trophy<br><br>Kris Commons holds aloft the Premiership trophy<br><br>Lennon&#39;s side received the top-flight trophy on Sunday after a 3-1 win over Dundee United on the last day of the season.<br><br>The result took Celtic on to 99 points for the campaign, they broke through the 100 league goals mark, and it ensured they finished the season unbeaten at home in the Premiership.<br><br>&quot;To finish off the season with a win is everything I could have asked for from the day,&quot; added Lennon.<br><br>&quot;The players have been brilliant and it&#39;s all about them and the supporters today. I said to the players, &#39;Enjoy it because it goes very very quickly&#39;.<br><br>&quot;As soon as the Champions League group stage was finished, we felt we&#39;d be more consistent in the league and that turned out to be the case.&quot;<br><br>Anthony Stokes hit the opener against United, with Georgios Samaras adding a penalty and Kris Commons completing the scoring after a Filip Twardzik own goal.<br><br>Commons, who won the PFA Scotland player of the year and will also be named the PFA football writers&#39; player of the year, admitted he is already excited about next term.<br><br>&quot;From last year, our league form needed to be rectified and to get 99 points, 100 goals and a clean-sheet record is outstanding,&quot; he said<br><br>&quot;Hopefully, in pre-season, we&#39;ll be fitter, stronger and more determined to make things happen next year.<br><br>&quot;I just can&#39;t wait for next year to start and crack on with the Champions League qualifiers.&quot;<br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 3, Dundee United 1.<br>90:00 +2:03 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 3, Dundee United 1.<br>90:00 +1:52 Booking<br><br>Booking Beram Kayal (Celtic) is shown the yellow card.<br>90:00 +1:47<br><br>Foul by Beram Kayal (Celtic).<br>90:00 +1:47<br><br>Stuart Armstrong (Dundee United) wins a free kick in the defensive half.<br>90:00 +0:12<br><br>Hand ball by Beram Kayal (Celtic).<br>89:35<br><br>Attempt missed.

Twardzik o.g. 76<br><br>CELTIC turned on the style in the second half to dispatch Dundee United 3-1 in Paradise and finish their fantastic season with a flourish.<br><br>Anthony Stokes&rsquo; header - the Hoops&rsquo; 100th goal of the campaign &ndash; and a Georgios Samaras penalty put the champions in charge after a low-key opening 45 minutes.<br><br>Filip Twardzik&rsquo;s unfortunate own goal gave the visitors a glimmer of hope but Kris Commons&rsquo; cheeky finish sealed the victory as the party got into full swing.<br><br>It was the perfect prelude to the trophy presentation which followed after the final whistle as Scott Brown was handed the Scottish Premiership prize by Celtic greats John Hartson and Stiliyan Petrov and held it aloft for a third successive season.<br><br>And there were then special scenes as the players and management team were accompanied by their families on a lap of honour around the ground and took the acclaim of a huge crowd.<br><br>Neil Lennon had made six changes to the Celtic side who shared the spoils against St Johnstone on Wednesday night. <br><br>Just 48 hours after helping the Under-20s to five-in-a-row, Czech youngster Twardzik was restored to the top team for the first time since September 2012, having spent the majority of that time on the treatment table. Fraser Forster, Brown, Commons, Stokes and Leigh Griffiths also came into the starting XI.<br><br>Although there was a carnival atmosphere around the ground ahead of kick-off, matters took on a more sombre note for a while as Paradise remembered brave Bhoy Oscar Knox. The five-year-old tragically passed away earlier in the week after a long illness and the players donned black armbands to honour the youngster.<br><br>Supporters had already sang You&rsquo;ll Never Alone before the game got underway, and when the five-minute mark was reached the whole of the stadium stood on masse, applauded and gave a further rendition of that famous, moving anthem. It was a fitting tribute. <br><br>On the pitch, the visitors, who would be reappearing here next weekend in the Scottish Cup final, started briskly without ever really testing Forster.<br><br>Gavin Gunning saw a free-kick blocked by the all, before Paul Paton and John Rankin both dragged shots from distance wide.<br><br>Celtic gradually found their rhythm, however. An incisive passing move involving Virgil van Dijk and Griffiths presented Stokes with some space to exploit in the box, but the Irishman&rsquo;s return pass lacked accuracy and the chance went amiss.<br><br>At the other end, talented teenager Ryan Gauld then picked out Ryan Dow inside the box but van Dijk showed his class by making a timely interception.<br><br>And moments later, Griffiths&rsquo; pace saw him beat Keith Watson to a long ball and bring out a save from Radolsaw Cierzniak from an acute angle.<br><br>The speed and movement of the former Hibernian man was proving Celtic&rsquo;s main threat in the opening stages. But after a favourable break of the ball in the box gave him a sight of goal, he was unable to capitalise as his weak effort was gratefully scooped up by Cierzniak. <br><br>The Polish shot-stopper then thwarted Stokes and Griffiths in quick succession. Paton and Stokes tried their luck at either end before the break but a breakthrough remained elusive for both sides.<br><br>During the interval, the U20s took centre stage as they were presented with their prize after sealing a fantastic fifth consecutive championship at Tannadice on Friday. Captain Marcus Fraser lifted the trophy to huge cheers before the rest of the Bhoys and the coaching staff took the acclaim of the crowd.<br><br>Determined to finish the season with a flourish, Celtic displayed greater urgency after the restart but it was the Terrors who fashioned the first opening as Farid El Alagui blazed over after Forster has pushed away Mark Wilson&rsquo;s attempt from a tight angle.<br><br>Back came the Bhoys, and Griffiths had a goal disallowed for offside, before they finally found a way through the Tannadice side in the 64th minute.<br><br>Commons dug out a dangerous delivery from the right and Stokes rose highest to guide a header beyond Cierzniak into the far corner for his 21st goal of the season. <br><br>As the game became more stretched, Commons stung Cierzniak&rsquo;s palms with a fizzing drive from 20 yards before Forster surpassed his opposite number with a diving save to deny Stuart Armstrong.<br><br>Samaras had been given a rapturous reception as he entered the fray from the bench and it was the Greek striker who doubled the advantage.<br><br>Displaying terrific determination, he won the ball back off Gunning in the box, rounded Cierzniak and was then brought down. The crowd urged him to take the spot kick and he was duly handed the ball by his team-mates, and Samaras made no mistake, sending the keeper the wrong way.<br><br>United reduced arrears in fortuitous circumstances as Gary Mackay-Steven&rsquo;s cross was deflected into his own net by the unfortunate Twardzik, who had turned in an assured and composed performance at left-back <br><br>But that was proved merely a consolation as Celtic extended their lead as Commons was sent clear and deftly chipped over the advancing Cierzniak.<br><br>Beram Kayal and van Dijk could have added gloss to scoreline as the clock ticked down, as the champions finished strongly to end a dominant season with only one league defeat to their name. <br><br>CELTIC (4-3-1-2) Forster; Lustig (Kayal 78) Ambrose, van Dijk, F.

They got over 100 goals and the likes of Commons and Stokes can reflect on a very productive season. <br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a remarkable season for some of them &ndash; van Dijk, Forster, Brown. We have some good players here at the club, and certainly in the second half of the season there has been real progress and improvement which gives us a lot of encouragement to build on for next season. <br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very special wining every sort of trophy. For a long time in the 1980s and 90s it was a struggle for us but now we are very productive in terms of picking up trophies and being successful on and off the field. So I&rsquo;m very proud of that and proud to have joined a select band of Celtic managers. <br><br>&ldquo;I am one of a few who have actually being privileged enough to do this job and when you are here you want to make it work and make the most of it. We can be pretty proud of what we have achieved in the last four years. <br><br>&ldquo;The players have kept themselves really focused and now we will look to the qualifiers and making sure we are at the big table for next season.&quot; <br><br>It was an emotional afternoon for Georgios Samaras who converted a penalty after earning it for himself on what could be his last appearance for the club. <br><br>&ldquo;It looked that way,&rdquo; said the Irishman. &ldquo;It was a nice touch from Kris to give Sami the opportunity to say goodbye properly, and we wanted to give him that as well. <br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no big secret now that it doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s going to be here next year and if he does go he goes with the warmest wishes of the backroom team and players.&rdquo;<br><br>And asked what his been most memorable moments of the past 12 months, the Hoops boss cited several highlights. <br><br>&ldquo;Seeing Fraser Forster getting capped for England was a remarkable achievement for a player playing in Scotland, qualifying for the Champions League and the fact we have only lost one game out of 38,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;We had the one blip at Aberdeen when we were down to 10 men and that can happen. Their consistency is fantastic, getting over 100 goals and winning the league by a big margin.&quot;<br><br><br>Commons: It&#39;s an honour to be a Celt<br><br>By: Kenny McKay on 11 May, 2014 16:04<br><br>KRIS Commons has hailed the Celtic support as they celebrated a third consecutive Scottish league title with a trophy day win at Paradise.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s Player of the Year praised the impact of the supporters as he helped the Hoops to a 3-1 victory over Dundee United to kick-start the Trophy Day celebrations.<br><br>After the full-time whistle, Celtic legends Stiliyan Petrov and John Hartson took to the stage to present the Bhoys with their medals before captain Scott Brown lifted the SPFL Scottish Premiership trophy &ndash; sending Paradise into raptures.<br><br>Speaking exclusively to Celtic TV after the match, Commons, who bagged his 32nd goal of the season, described the atmoshphere at Celtic Park as unique.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;I was in two minds whether to smash it or dink it but luckily enough for me, the keeper went to ground and that made things easier, and I got the goal on a great day for everyone.<br><br>&ldquo;There are a lot of good players in Scotland and down in England who don&rsquo;t get the chance to experience and appreciate this, it&rsquo;s special and there&rsquo;s no other club like it.<br><br>&ldquo;It makes you appreciate every moment that you have with the club. The fans are one of a kind, that goes without saying, but it&rsquo;s on days like this when you collect your medal that you get a sense of how much it means to everyone. It&rsquo;s an honour to be here and to be involved with this club.&rdquo;  <br><br></div>
