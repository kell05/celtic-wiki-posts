This country would be a better place if Rangers did not exist.&quot;   <br><b>Ian Archer (journalist, 1970s), for full article see: <a class="external" href="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/jZT0c0XagMFQJu4xGnrK2Q253131/GW344H650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a></b><br><br>&quot;The incessant bigoted chanting by Rangers fans at Hampden was shocking. Unarguably the most socially-backward fans in British football. The really damaging thing for RFC is, it&rsquo;s not the mythical &lsquo;small minority&rsquo;. There appear to be 1000s upon 1000s singing these songs.&quot;<br><b>Graham Spiers (Journalist) on his Twitter feed commenting on the Huns in their league cup final appearance (March 2011) (<a href="/page/2011-03-20%3A+Celtic+1-2+Rangers%2C+League+Cup" target="_self">match</a>)</b><br><br>COMEDIAN Andy Cameron was barracked by fellow Rangers&#39; shareholders yesterday when he asked the club&#39;s chairman Mr John Paton to &quot;come out and be honest&quot; about the board&#39;s policy towards Roman Catholics. Mr Cameron, whose earlier remarks about the calibre of the Rangers&#39; team had drawn laughs and cheers from the floor of the club&#39;s annual meeting, was heckled and told to sit down. Minutes later, a number of shareholders milled round Mr Cameron and exchanged angry remarks with him.<br><b>The Herald (Oct 2010); the above happened in 1985</b><br><br>&quot;Celtic came from the poorer classes from the East End of Glasgow, to a certain extent Rangers had gone the other way because they had become popular with the aristocracy with managing directors for example, magistrates who came to Ibrox and there started to become a division between the two. So Rangers were seen to be the club of authority of the union, and Celtic had their Irish which to some extent was suppressed as well. So that&#39;s what started to create the divisions.&quot; <br><b>David Mason - Club historian for Rangers/Sevco; From &quot;Football A brief history of the game&quot;<br></b><br>&quot;There&#39;s nothing worse than sitting in the dressing room at Celtic Park after a defeat, not a word being said, listening to them going mental next door.&quot;<br><b>Ally McCoist (ex-Rangers striker)</b><br><br>&quot;Rangers like the big strong powerful fellows, with a bit of strength and solidity in the tackle, rather than the frivolous, quick moving stylists like <a href="/page/Jimmy+Johnstone" target="_self">Jimmy Johnstone</a>, small, tiptoe-through-the-tulips type of players who excite people.&quot;<br><b>Willie Waddell, Rangers manager 1972</b><br><br>Brian Clough: &quot;What team did you say you support again?&quot;<br>Man in the studio audience: &quot;RANGERS!&quot;<br>Brian Clough: &quot;That&#39;s not a football team! That&#39;s a gang of villains.&quot;<br><b>The irrepressible Brian Clough on &quot;Sport in Question&quot;</b><br><br>&quot;In every hick town in Caledonia across the pseudo nation, you can see the most ****** up scum who were shat into creation, where a blue McEwans&#39; lager top equals NO imagination!<br>&quot;Think you&#39;re a success?<br>&quot;Your psyche&#39;s a mess!<br>&quot;Your economy is in distress, you&#39;re HUN-believable!!!&quot;<br><b>Irvine Welsh, the irrepressible novelist on his opinion about Rangers fans (1996)<br></b><br>&ldquo;We are the biggest club in Britain and people had better realise it. There&rsquo;s no limit to our ambition.&rdquo; <br><b>As an example of hubris, this statement from then Rangers chairman David Murray(1993)</b><br><br>&quot;If Celtic never won another game it would be a source of enormous rejoicing to me.&quot; <br><b>DeidCo vice-Chairman Donald Findlay (Mar 1996)<br></b><br>&quot;Rangers fans are different from Celtic fans in the respect that they take it badly when they lose. Celtic have gone public, many of their fans have stumped up hard money to buy shares, which in turn has helped finance their stadium. As a result, I sometimes think that their supporters feel greater loyalty to the cause. Rangers fans basically got the stadium for nothing, and some of them have had it too easy for too long.&quot; <br><b>David Murray (1997)</b><br> <br>&quot;You can sing &#39;Live Forever&#39; and get a good feeling. I don&#39;t know whether you can get a good feeling out of &#39;Follow Follow&#39;.&quot;<br><b>Alan McGee (Creation Records founder, 1998)</b><br><br>&#39;It&#39;s not that they weren&#39;t penalties - it&#39;s just that they&#39;re the kind of penalties nobody else gets!&#39;<br><b>Not the View fanzine in 2003 after Rangers were awarded three penalties in their 2-2 draw with Dundee in May 2003</b><br><br>&quot;I&#39;d just come from Italy and France which are catholic countries,very warm and friendly,and here I was in Glasgow with some of my team-mates [i.e. fellow Rangers players] hating catholics. I just couldn&#39;t understand it and frankly found it ridiculous.&quot;<br><b>Ray Wilkins on an ESPN documentary said about Rangers (June 2007)<br></b><br>Walter Smith, a two-time former manager of the club and now manager of Scotland, once said to me: &ldquo;There is a Protestant superiority syndrome around this club . . . you can feel it.&rdquo; <br><b>Graham Spiers quoting Walter Smith (taken from his book on Paul Le Guen&#39;s time at Rangers, 2007)</b><br><br>&quot;When I came here in 1964, we had no Catholics,&quot; he said. &quot;Not just the playing staff, anywhere. There was no bit of paper, it was an unwritten rule. David Murray changed that and it moved on significantly in 1989 when <a href="/page/Johnston%2C+Maurice" target="_self">Maurice Johnston</a> signed. You cannot clear up 80 years of sectarianism in eight months, but we are a huge way down the road.&quot;<br><b>Sandy Jardine</b><br><br>It was not until the 1960&rsquo;s that the burning issue of sectarianism reared its ugly head at Ibrox. A former player, Ralph Brand, made the sectarian policy at Rangers public knowledge and around this time the behaviour of Rangers fans was a real problem for the club. In 1963, Rangers fans jeered during the minute&rsquo;s silence for assassinated Catholic U.S. President John F. Kennedy. Then, in 1967, then vice Chairman Matt Taylor was questioned about Rangers no Catholics policy and he stated that he felt that they policy was &ldquo;part of our tradition....we were formed in 1873 as a Protestant boys club. To change now would lose us considerable support.&rdquo;<br><b>Vice-Chairman Matt Taylor of Rangers from 1960s</b><br><br>&quot;I was reluctant to entertain exposing my family to the risk of a recurrence of the bigotry that I had encountered in my playing days... Cathy&#39;s religion [she was Catholic] would probably have been enough in itself to convince me that returning to Rangers was not a good idea.&quot; <br><b>Alex Ferguson (ex-Rangers player) on why he turned down advances to take over Rangers managers role<br></b><br>&ldquo;The principal muck-spreader was Willie Allison, the bigoted public relations officer, who clearly felt that anybody married to a Catholic was not a fit and proper person to play for Rangers. Allison was a religious bigot of the deepest dye. I had a thoroughly Protestant upbringing but, of course, Cathy is Catholic and so were my mother&rsquo;s family.&rdquo;<br><b>Alex Ferguson (ex-Rangers player) on Rangers</b><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Alex Ferguson - Pic" height="870" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/lDJjNLxphSBXlEjwG5ciTw1693567/GW489H870" title="Rangers - Alex Ferguson - Pic" width="489"><br><b>Alex Ferguson (ex-Rangers Player) on his time with Rangers</b><br><br><i>To the Rangers fans:</i> &quot;Stay and vomit in your own home, urinate in the corner of your own sitting room, fight with your own neighbours Celtic (who deserve a medal for putting up with you) and foul the streets of Glasgow.

I told him I wasn&#39;t. I was an English Protestant. Why, then, he asked, did I cross myself? &quot;I told him it was for luck but he told me to remember I was a Protestant and warned me never to do it again - if I did, he would really sort me out. &#39;<br><b>Based on Terry Butcher&#39;s book, surprising Ally Hunter would later have Celtic down for his testimonial (in <a href="/page/1981-11-03%3A+Ipswich+Town+2-3+Celtic%2C+Testimonial+-+Pictures" target="_self">1981</a>)</b><br><br>&quot;The people in that CCTV footage acted like a pack of wolves.

Now Mutu has expressed his own distaste.<br>&quot;I&#39;ve never seen a team play like that at home before, but that is their game, their tactic, and what they believe in,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought maybe they would want to make more of a spectacle for the fans. For me, it was an ugly game. They were defending all the time and I just hope we see a bit more attacking, some spectacular&quot;<br><b>Mutu (Fiorentina) on Rangers just before 2nd leg game in UEFA cup v Huns (Apr 08)</b><br><br>&quot;The wife of a Rangers Supporters Club secretary from East Kilbride declared that she had been suffering from insomnia as a result of disturbing religious visions involving Johnston: &ldquo;My blood is boiling. Is Mo Johnston going to run about Ibrox with his crucifix? I&rsquo;ve though about nothing else all night.&rdquo; David Miller, General Secretary of the Rangers Supporters Association was peddling an equally hard line: &ldquo;I never thought in my wildest dreams that they would sign him. Why him above all? It&rsquo;s a sad day for Rangers. There will be a lot of people handing in their season tickets. I don&rsquo;t want to see a Roman Catholic at Ibrox. Rangers have always stood for one thing and the biggest majority of the support have been brought up with the idea of a true blue Rangers team. I thought they would sign a Catholic eventually, perhaps in three or four years time, but someone from the continent.&rdquo; <br><b>Quotes from Not The View Fanzine</b><br><br>&ldquo;Celtic have all the cool people supporting them.

I&#39;d never been sent off in my career and so I had this conversation with him. Basically I told him that, if he sent me off, he&#39;d be demoted from Grade One refereeing - the lot. That was in the days when Rangers had a good relationship with the Scottish FA.&quot;<br><b>Football Bloody Hell by Patrick Barclay when it mentions a tussle between Alex Ferguson and John Greig (Rangers player) that results in Greig getting sent off. Greig who felt he deserved only a booking relates. Plus ca change....</b><br><br><div>  &quot;....yes we&#39;ve had some pretty rank poets over the years. Thomson was probably a Rangers fan in-waiting. Rule Britannia has no modern value and should be dumped in the dustbin of history. It celebrates sentiments and ideologies that have brought great shame on parts of &#39;our&#39; collective British history. Anyone that thinks slavery is smart or justifiable or just a wind up should reconsider why this song still persists in parts of Neanderthal British life. Forget the &#39;Hokey Cokey&#39; guff, Rule Britannia is a song that lords it over other races, celebrates institutionalised racism, and promotes racial supremacy and it should be banned. No correction it should not need to be banned. People should be so ashamed of its vile sentiments they would not knowingly sing it. Its hardly surprising that Rangers fans are the exception. No one else would want to sing this dated piece of imperialist cant. &quot;<br><b>Stuart Cosgrove (Journalist)</b></div><br>Sergio Porrini thinks Rangers could pick up a European trophy within the next three years. He said, &quot;if we can overcome Gothenburg I think we can reach the quarter finals.

Daft idiot!</b><br><br>Rangers have been dubbed &quot;the stupidest club in Europe&quot; by France Football magazine. Senior correspondent Christophe Larcher condemned Rangers in a scathing attack on Strasbourg&#39;s opponents in the UEFA Cup first round. He said, &quot;Rangers have spent fortunes on second-rate players and they keep getting knocked out in the first round of European competition. For these reasons they deserve the title of the stupidest club in the continent. As if further proof was needed, they went out against Gothenburg in the European Cup qualifiers after a 3-0 thrashing in Sweden.&quot;<br><b>Christophe Larcher (France Football) 3 September 1997</b><br><br>&quot;The famous Rangers Iron Curtain of the 1940s derived from the emphasis on physical strength which Struth had developed in the previous decades. Another potent factor was they were all Protestants, to a man (with suspicions over one or two). And it mattered, deeply. Hardly an eyebrow was raised in Scottish society about this exclusivity during the Struth reign. People largely acquiesced as simply a fact of life. And Struth himself, with a penchant for made-to-measure three-piece suits, a stern countenance and a master of moral rebuke, seemed to be the epitome of the Presbyterian High Tory for whom the tugging of the forelock was expected in an orderly, unchanging society.<br>&quot;Certainly people from both sides of the divide had a high regard for him as a man of principle, including Paddy Travers of Clyde, a Catholic with whom Struth had holidayed on the Isle of Man. And, ironically, there was a great bond between the man who effectively brought Stein to Parkhead, Jimmy Gribben the Celtic trainer, for whom Struth kept a &ldquo;wee hauf&rdquo; at Ibrox any time Celtic played there.<br>&quot;At that time he was not being forced to engage himself with the highly dubious morality of valuing people of another religion as not fit for purpose. With ample Protestant talent available to him, on the principle of<b> &ldquo;If it ain&rsquo;t broke, why fix it?&rdquo;</b>, life simply rolled on.<br>&quot;That is why the Struth legacy contains a crucial paradox for the modern Rangers. It can be interpreted in two ways. Without doubt the triumphs, the longevity, the production of great players, all point to a man of distinction and talent. On the other hand, from the baseline of supremacy and triumphalism set, he bequeathed the club a dilemma. The temptation to maintain the tradition was initially overpowering. Waddell and Wallace in the 1970s and 1980s began to see their recruitment options diminishing but were shackled by their own personal inclinations.&quot;<b><br>The Herald article on Bill Struth</b> (<a class="external" href="http://sundayheraldsalon.com/salon/2006/09/the_whole_struth.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>)<br><br>&ldquo;On the Rangers terracing on Saturday there was congregated a gang, thousands strong, including the dregs and scourings of filthy slumdom, unwashed yahoos, jailbirds nighthawks, won&#39;t works, burro-barnacles and pavement pirates, all, or nearly all, in the scarecrow stage of verminous trampdom.

But Terry Butcherhas revealed how Johnston was initially treated as an outcast by some of his Scottish team-mates at Ibrox. <br>And Rangers kitman Jimmy Bel, made sure he got the message, refusing to leave Mo&#39;s training kit outside his hotel door at their Italian pre-season base, as he did with other players. <br>Former club captain Tel explains in his autobiography: &quot;It was, as far as I was concerned, a fabulous signing for the club because Mo was such a good player, while Souness had achieved his ambition of beginning to break down the sectarian barriers at Ibrox. <br>&quot;Our only doubt was we knew Mo was fiercely proud of being a Celtic fan and we wondered how he would settle. We need not have worried - he was terrific. <br>&quot;Next day, the club wanted the Scottish and English players to hold a press conference to tell the media what a good signing he was. <br>&quot;There was no problem as far as Ray Wilkins, Chris Woods, Mark Walters, I and some others were concerned.

In fact, in the end he made a joke about it. <br>&quot;But this was a complete upheaval for the club. Even at meal-times there were a number of Scots who would not sit with him. <br>&quot;What had happened to the moral high ground claimed by Rangers? <br>&quot;They always used to say it was Celtic who were intolerant and unable to cope with the mixing of religions.

No, their real religion is Rangers Football Club.<br>&quot;Glasgow Rangers is the sporting icon for loyalist bigots. The club&#39;s own words are irreproachably neutral. It is law-abiding. It is patriotically British. Its outward message is of harmony and ecumenism. But to the large thug element amongst the Rangers fans the key to their identity is almost like the Third Secret of Fatima. It is this: NO FENIANS here.<br>&quot;There is a congenial, indeed government-backed myth, in both Scotland and in Ireland, that &quot;one side is bad as another&quot;: that Sinn Fein-IRA are pretty much the same as the UDA/UVF. This is simply untrue. There is no republican equivalent to the Romper Rooms of the UDA, wherein men were routinely beaten to a pulp by loyalist thugs, and from which both the term and the practice became celebrated. And then there was Lenny Murphy and his merry gang, the Shankill Butchers, who for years in the mid-1970s abducted, tortured and murdered Catholics -- usually by cutting their victims&#39; throats.<br>&quot;This culture did not emerge simply as a response to IRA violence. It was there already. It was feckless, violent, drunken, lost, lumpen proletarians for whom a perverted tribal identity conjoined with a Godlessly Calvinist sense of superiority, even as they stewed in their ghettoes of suffocating illiteracy and economic failure. But they were nonetheless elevated by the insane delusion that they are the chosen people, who have been deprived of their birthright by some vast conspiracy between the Catholic Church and the British government.&quot;<br><b><a class="external" href="http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/kevin-myers/kevin-myers-tribal-bigotry-is-not-a-response-to-ira-violence-it-was-there-before-2803409.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kevin Myres</a> (Independent.ie)<br><br></b>&quot;Rangers had an unfortunate historical legacy with regard to the religious issue.
