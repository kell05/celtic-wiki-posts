However, the match will be remembered for a bad decision by the incompetent referee who ajudged McGeady to have dived and sent him off! Disgraceful, and he was wrong, even over ruling his own linesman. Deserves to get barred from games. He was too card happy also.<br><br>First half was a real damp squid, but we still managed to grab a lead from a Samaras header via a Hinkel cross. Other than that, Hibs were excellent at the counter attack and lucky for us their strikers had poor shots else we&#39;d not have gotten 3pts. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3"

Martin Conaghan</span><br><span class="diffAdd">BBC</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Aiden McGeady was sent off as Celtic held on for a thrilling Scottish Premier League win at Hiberian.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Georgios Samaras headed Celtic ahead four minutes from half-time from an excellent Andreas Hinkel cross.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The visitors were reduced to 10 men on 63 minutes when McGeady was shown a second yellow card for simulation.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Artur Boruc made a terrific stop from David Wotherspoon&#39;s blistering 25-yard shot and Hibs goalkeeper Graham Stack kept out a late Samaras solo effort.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The hard-fought victory at Easter Road keeps Celtic locked with Rangers at the top of the table with maximum points from three games.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Less than 60 seconds after kick-off, Samaras was caught late by Patrick Cregg, to set the tone for a hotly-contested match.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Hibs had the first real chance of the match when Wotherspoon fired in a cross from the right and Glenn Loovens was forced to make an awkward clearance.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">McGeady then completed a sweeping move through the Hibs midfield but blasted his long-range effort over the crossbar, while a Samaras header clipped the top of the Hibs goal-frame from a corner.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">McGeady was shown his first yellow card in the 22nd minute when he felled Derek Riordan after the Hibs striker had broken free down the left.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">However, the former Celtic man failed to convert the resulting free-kick, inching it past Artur Boruc&#39;s right-hand post.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">A Danny Fox free-kick shortly after the half hour mark looked promising, but Samaras miscued his shot and the ball was finally cleared.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The stalemate was broken four minutes from the break when Samaras headed in from close range after Hinkel powered down the right and delivered a wonderful ball for the Greek international.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Following the restart, Boruc was forced into a double-save from Riordan&#39;s 18-yard shot and subsequent corner.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic looked confident on the counter-attack, with Shaun Maloney sending a ball across the face of the Hibs goal in the 55th minute with which Samaras failed to connect.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Souleymane Bamba missed an opportunity to level the scores as the hour mark approached, hacking the ball wide from a wide angle from six yards out.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">McGeady was issued his second yellow of the day and sent for an early bath as Paul Hanlon withdrew from a tackle near the halfway line.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Referee Dougie McDonald decided that no contact had been made and the Republic of Ireland international was dismissed for simulation.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Moments later, Wotherspoon blasted in a spectacular, dipping half-volley from 25 yards out that Boruc pushed on to his right-hand post.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Riordan was again denied by Boruc when the

Celtic helped stimulate debate  about simulation in the corridors of power with their protestations following  Eduardo&#39;s antics for Arsenal against them last week, but yesterday saw them reap  the whirlwind when Aiden McGeady was sent off against Hibernian - for  simulation.</div> <div class="LeadPara">To be fair to the Parkhead club, the call for Uefa to  re-focus their attempts to root-out diving was led by midfielder Massimo Donati,  now on the brink of a move to Bari, and also Gordon Smith, the chief executive  of the Scottish Football Association.</div> <div class="TailParas">While angered by the penalty award last in last week&#39;s  Champions League play-off, manager Tony Mowbray was less voluble, perhaps  fearing that his club might be bitten on the backside.</div> <div class="TailParas">If so, his concerns were justified, with McGeady now the  latest high-profile footballer to land in the mine-field that is the diving  debate. The winger fell after a challenge from Hibs left-back Paul Hanlon just  after the hour mark in his side&#39;s 1-0 victory yesterday, and felt the full  impact of the recently revived resolve within the game to penalise those who aim  to gain an advantage through deceitful means. The irony of Celtic being the ones  made to suffer in the midst of this crackdown will not be lost on Arsene Wenger,  among others.</div> <div class="TailParas">The Arsenal manager complained of a Scottish conspiracy at  the end of last week, noting the presence of Scots such as David Taylor in high  office at Uefa. He also drew scorn for his attempt to link Eduardo&#39;s dive in  midweek to an earlier incident where the player received serious injury. But  Mowbray&#39;s argument yesterday that McGeady was simply tired also deserves to be  met with incredulity. Wenger suggested Eduardo had dived away from Artur Boruc  as a preventative measure during Arsenal&#39;s 3-0 victory on Wednesday, with  memories of a career-threatening injury sustained against Birmingham City two  years ago still fresh in his mind. Mowbray&#39;s attempt to exonerate McGeady was  similarly hard to credit.</div> <div class="TailParas">Whether he was tired or not, McGeady was adjudged by  referee Dougie McDonald to have made the most of the incident, with Hanlon  having attempted to pull-out of the challenge. The Celtic player was thus  booked, and, having collected a yellow card earlier, subsequently sent  off.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Unfortunately we seem to have suffered a double-whammy,&quot;  said Mowbray. &quot;We suffered from the penalty on Wednesday and we suffered again  today.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">The Celtic manager, who had been standing just yards away  from where the incident occurred, vented his fury on the touchline. McGeady  exhibited less agitation and headed away almost immediately for the  tunnel.</div> <div class="TailParas">His manager later used his good view as a reason not to  watch the incident again on a television monitor, when invited to during an  interview on ESPN.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It happened right in front of me. I didn&#39;t need to watch  it again,&quot; he later explained to reporters. &quot;You have to put it in the context  of the boy travelling 40 nor 50 yards before the incident. You can make whatever  judgment you want on the incident but he has travelled with the ball for 20  yards. He has skipped past the first tackle, he has carried on and skipped past  the second tackle, and then he sees another tackle coming. Is it a dive? Never  in a million years. A dive is when you try to influence the referee and throw  your arms up. If the Eduardo situation had not blown up nationally, then 99  times out of 100, or even 100 times out of a 100, never would a yellow card have  been shown.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It&#39;s just unfortunate for Aiden that we have had the week  we have had,&quot; he continued.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It happened straight in front of me. There was a very  tired footballer there. The referee has to use a bit of a game knowledge. [It  was a] very poor decision. The half-way line is not the place to try and  simulate a dive and gain an advantage.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Mowbray noted that the near-side assistant referee had  flagged for a foul to Celtic. Even Hibs manager John Hughes thought that Hanlon  was the one being booked when the referee brought out his card.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I would suggest the linesman is a lot closer to the  referee,&quot; said Mowbray. &quot;In the week we have had the referee has probably been  influenced by this diving situation. I work with Aiden McGeady every day.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;If you have any intelligence you look at the build-up to  the incident and the fact he is skipping tackles. Players like Aidan McGeady  must ride tackles otherwise they will never play football. He nicked it past  him, skipped the tackle and went over. He went to ground because he was probably  knackered. You just can&#39;t keep skipping tackles like that.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Hughes rued his side&#39;s inability to make the most of the  one-man advantage, although David Wotherspoon did hit the post with a long-range  effort.</div> <div class="TailParas">The Hibs manager also expressed some sympathy for McGeady,  hinting at the caution referees must exhibit in such circumstances. &quot;You have to  watch what you are doing,&quot; he said. &quot;Sometimes someone sticks a leg out and you  have to hurdle it, which results in losing your balance. It&#39;s a very thin line  we are treading here.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">(c) 2009 </div> <div class="TailParas">The Scotsman</div><br><div class="Title"><h3>Shadow of Eduardo looms over Mowbray as Celtic take points but  lose McGeady for diving: Hibernian 0 Celtic 1 Samaras 41</h3></div> <div class="Provided"> <div>31 August 2009</div>Provided by: The Guardian</div><br><div class="LeadPara">A penny for Arsene Wenger&#39;s thoughts. Four days and  thousands of column inches since Eduardo da Silva&#39;s penalty-box dive for Arsenal  against Celtic, it was the Scottish side who were at the centre of a simulation  controversy. As far as the Celtic manager, Tony Mowbray, is concerned, Eduardo&#39;s  con trick - or more accurately the hubris which has followed it - played a part  in the dismissal of Aiden McGeady.</div> <div class="LeadPara">McGeady, already on a yellow card for a first-half foul on  Derek Riordan, earned a second caution after 62 minutes having embellished a  challenge from Paul Hanlon near the halfway line. Cue much wailing from Celtic&#39;s  supporters - the same ones who have been calling for Eduardo to be hung, drawn  and quartered in recent days - and a similarly perplexed reaction from Mowbray.  In what was a highly amusing post-match scene, the manager even refused to watch  the contentious incident when replayed on a television monitor beside him.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I don&#39;t need to watch it again, it happened right beside  me,&quot; Mowbray insisted. &quot;If the Eduardo thing hadn&#39;t been blown up, hadn&#39;t become  nationally so big, then never in a million years was that a yellow card. The  match officials got sucked in. If it hadn&#39;t happened this week, 99 times out of  100 that decision would not have been given. I think we are all in disbelief;  the linesman even signalled for a free-kick to us at the time and he was a lot  closer to the incident than the referee.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Although Mowbray&#39;s explanation that McGeady was &quot;knackered&quot;  and attempting to ride Hanlon&#39;s challenge following a 30-yard run has a degree  of merit, at least one camera angle proves there was no contact between the  players. Wenger, who has been so vociferous over what he regards as a  &quot;witch-hunt&quot; against his striker, would have been an interested onlooker. &quot;I  didn&#39;t touch him,&quot; Hanlon confirmed. &quot;Aiden isn&#39;t a cheat, he was running at a  fair pace at the time, I just managed to get my body out of the way. I think the  referee got it right.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">McGeady&#39;s red card threatened to halt Celtic&#39;s flawless  start to the league season but basic belligerence, and some brilliance from  their goalkeeper Artur Boruc, secured the three points. Hibernian laid siege to  the visiting goal in the closing stages, Boruc superbly clawing a David  Wotherspoon volley on to the frame of the goal before Anthony Stokes, Riordan  and Sol Bamba and Colin Nish all passed up opportunities to restore  parity.</div> <div class="TailParas">Ultimately Hibs could not cancel out Georgios Samaras&#39;s  41st-minute goal, which was headed beyond Graham Stack from six yards after a  fine Andreas Hinkel cross, but that basic detail will be lost amid what is sure  to be another cheating debate north of the border. McGeady received support, at  least, from the Hibs manager, John Hughes. &quot;I don&#39;t think Aiden&#39;s that kind of  guy,&quot; Hughes said. &quot;He&#39;s an honest, hard-working player and I don&#39;t want to see  anyone getting sent off.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Mowbray refused to confirm that his trio of McGeady, Scott  Brown and Scott McDonald will still be Celtic players after the closure of the  transfer window.</div> <div class="TailParas">Man of the match Artur Boruc (Celtic)</div> <div class="TailParas">Celtic&#39;s Aiden McGeady is sent off for diving after a  disputed second booking</div> <div class="TailParas">&copy; Copyright 2009.
