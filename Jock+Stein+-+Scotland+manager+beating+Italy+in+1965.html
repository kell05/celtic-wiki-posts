Having succeeded Ian McColl and taken temporary charge of the national team - the big man was also manager of Celtic - Stein guided Scotland to a 1-0 win over Italy after dispensing with six of the players who had forfeited points in the nation&#39;s previous World Cup qualifying tie on home turf against Poland. <br><br>In front of a full house of almost 101,000, Martin, the scorer of 53 goals in 65 league games for Hibs before being transferred to Roker Park, was among those enlisted by the legendary manager to breathe new life into Scotland&#39;s hopes of qualifying for the 1966 World Cup finals in England. <br><br>After losing a World Cup tie at Hampden for the first time in 11 years, the Scots came into the match as underdogs. Having thrashed the Poles 6-1 in their previous match, the Italians, on the other hand, were strong favourites to book their place in the finals by avoiding defeat in Glasgow. While McLeish was pleased the Old Firm matches were postponed last weekend, in 1965, Edmondo Fabbri, the Italian manager, was granted a month free of league games to prepare his men for Scotland. Stein, who previously managed Hibs, knew Martin&#39;s capabilities from his time at Easter Road. Against Italy in a crunch encounter, however, this clinical goalscorer was instructed by his prescient manager to fulfil a more complex role and deny the Italian sweeper either time or room to dictate possession. <br><br>&quot;Jock knew Italy&#39;s strengths and weaknesses and had spotted how they liked to build possession from the back,&quot; Martin recalled in conversation yesterday. &quot;Their goalkeeper wouldn&#39;t just kick the ball up the park. Instead he threw it to the sweeper. So Jock told me as soon as the ball was dead to press up on top of the sweeper and stop the keeper giving it to him. I was marking him rather than him marking me. I had a lot of running about to do and it was a fairly thankless task. In a lot of ways, it was much the same job either Kenny Miller or James McFadden might be asked to do on Saturday. I did a heck of a lot of running without the ball. <br><br>&quot;At that time, Italian football was renowned the world over for its defensive nature. AC Milan and Inter were the top club sides of the day and their players found it second nature to defend for 90 minutes. Jock said they would sit back and try to hit us on the break. That was what happened because Italy only needed a draw. Although we were on top of them all the time, we created very few openings. I suppose, in that respect, we were fortunate to get the late goal from John Greig. With just two minutes left, I think most of us feared it wasn&#39;t going to happen. <br><br>&quot;I played alongside Alan Gilzean and the Italians were so quick and skilful we didn&#39;t get many chances. I remember thinking, because of the ability they had, Italy didn&#39;t need to play that way. They could easily have been more attack-minded. What&#39;s different today is Scotland play the same style of football as Italy once played against us. We&#39;re more likely to score from a set-piece or from the middle of the park than through our attacking play. I feel there&#39;s a lot of hype surrounding the match which will only make Italy more determined. One thing is for sure, we won&#39;t get many more chances on Saturday than we did 42 years ago. I can only see one goal in the game and just hope the boys get the same result we did in 1965.&quot; <br><br>A tall, combative 25-year-old at the peak of his powers in the Sixties, Martin won three caps during that World Cup qualifying programme. He&#39;d caught Stein&#39;s eye at Easter Road and, like the peerless Willie Hamilton, who collected his solitary cap against Finland during the same campaign, was rewarded with international recognition. <br><br>&quot;I was on the books at Easter Road when Jock moved from Dunfermline and took over as manager, so he knew what I could do,&quot; added Martin. &quot;The situation with Scotland at that time was similar to today in as much as Walter Smith and Alex McLeish are shrewd men, who get the lads working for each other. That was also Jock&#39;s strength - he knew how to blend a team. <br><br>&quot;In those days the first preferences of the selectors were players who played for Rangers and Celtic. <br><br>&quot;When you think about it, the idea of a selection committee picking the team was farcical. Jock insisted on a bigger say and wouldn&#39;t have taken over unless he&#39;d been given more freedom.&quot; <br><br>Having returned to live in Tranent five years ago after a playing career in England which also included stints with Coventry, Nottingham Forest, Brighton and Crystal Palace as well as assisting Dave Mackay when he managed in the Gulf, Martin, 67, recalls with affection the opportunity to play in the same Scotland and Sunderland sides as Jim Baxter. &quot;He was so arrogant - the Italians were frightened of Baxter. We don&#39;t have anyone today with that confidence, apart from McFadden, who reminds me a wee bit of Jim in the way he&#39;ll take on anyone.&quot; <br><br>Should Scotland emulate the class of 1965 on Saturday, then McLeish&#39;s men will book a place in the finals of the European Championship. All those years past the Scots still had to travel to Naples and avoid defeat against Italy to stand a chance of World Cup qualification. <br><br>Martin was omitted and Stein handed the Liverpool centre-back, Ron Yeats, the No 9 shirt in what was a cautious game plan. Not even giants of the game get every decision right and Scotland were crushed 3-0. <br><br>Martin recalls the SFA selectors griping to the press about Stein&#39;s tactics at the airport on the journey home. The unimpressed manager was angered by the lack of faith shown in him and promptly relinquished the caretaker position. <br><br>While Stein would return in the late Seventies to manage Scotland in the aftermath of Argentina, Martin never played for his country again. &quot;When Jock stepped down, John Prentice followed him as manager and I wasn&#39;t selected again,&quot; he remembered. &quot;In those days, Scotland had plenty of good players. I was scoring 35 a season and couldn&#39;t get in. But, if we win on Saturday, my guess is whoever plays centre-forward won&#39;t look back on the game as their last cap.&quot;   <font face="Helv" size="2"><br><br><br>HEROES O F 1965 : WHERE ARE THEY NOW? <br>* BILL BROWNThen Spurs&#39; No 1, Brown went on to collect 28 caps for Scotland. Played in Toronto and settled in Canada to work in property development, where he died in 2004. <br><br>* DAVIE PROVANThis was one of only five Scotland caps for the Rangers full-back. After 12 years atIbrox, Provan joined Plymouth Argyle in 1970 and finished his playing career in England. Since inducted into Rangers&#39; Hall of Fame. <br><br>* JOHN GREIGThe goal hero won 44 caps for his country during a legendary 17-year career at Rangers. Awarded an MBE in 1977 and managed the Ibrox club between 1978 and 1983. Now a club ambassador and board member of Rangers. <br><br>* BOBBY MURDOCHThe Celtic midfield maestro remarkably earned only 12 caps. A Lisbon Lion, he left Parkhead in 1973 to join Middlesbrough who he also briefly managed. Died in 2001 aged 56. <br><br>* BILLY BREMNERThe tenacious Leeds United skipper picked up 54 caps in an impressive Scotland career. The Hall of Fame legend died in 1997 aged 54. <br><br>* RONNIE McKINNONThe Rangers defender was winning the first of 28 caps for Scotland. After 473 appearances for Rangers, McKinnon went on to play in South Africa in 1973 beforeemigrating to Australia. Now lives on the Isle of Lewis. <br><br>* JIM BAXTER&#39;Slim&#39; would go on to achieve legendary status among the Tartan Army for his ball juggling act in the historic 1967 win over England at Wembley. Lost his battle with cancer in 2001. <br><br>* WILLIE HENDERSONThe lightning-fast Rangers winger was another at the peak of his powers against Italy. Earned 29 international caps and now runs a hotel in Lanarkshire. <br><br>* ALAN GILZEANThe Spurs hero, who began his career with Dundee, led the line for Scotland against Italy and scored 12 goals in 22 internationals. Managed Stevenage Borough, and now lives nearby in Enfield. <br><br>* NEIL MARTINThe Sunderland striker made his third and final Scotland appearance against Italy. The former Hibs man went on to play for Coventry and Nottingham Forest before coaching and retired to his hometown of Tranent, East Lo t h i a n . <br><br>* JOHN HUGHESThe big Celtic striker earned eight caps for Scotland, and was a surprise inclusion by manager Jock Stein. But, with 189 goals in 416 Celtic outings, his class was beyond question. &#39;Yogi&#39; is now a Glasgow publican. <br><br>(c) 2007 <br>The Scotsman</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font></div></div>
