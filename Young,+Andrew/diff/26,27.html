He made his debut in a Regional League 2-2 draw at home to <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibs</a> on February 12 <a href="/page/1944" target="_self">1944</a>, taken off with blood streaming from a gash over the eye.<br><br>A talented and creative attacker Young&rsquo;s talents were obvious. However his wartime work as a miner in Fife meant it was near impossible for Young to work long shifts down the pit at Oakley on night shift and play for the Bhoys. The War Years were understandably difficult, and Andy Young is an example of the cost to our club of lost talent due to the circumstances (as much as due to anything else).<br><br>Consequently after just three games the gifted Andy Young was allowed to join Raith in September <a href="/page/1945" target="_self">1945</a>. <br><br>He was said at one time in 1953 to be &quot;<i>the most neglected player in Scottish football</i>&quot;, when some regarded that he deserved recognition with an international cap. Luck wasn&#39;t on his side.<br><br><blockquote><i>&quot;Andy Young is the most neglected player in Scottish Football... serves up tremendous stuff... not a better right-half in Scotland... when asked to moved forward has unfailingly put new life in the Raith front line Yet never a glance from the selectors despite one storming game after another&quot; (1953)</i><br></blockquote><br>Young went on to become one of the Kirkcaldy sides all time greats, and we&#39;ll never know what Celtic missed out on and what further he possibly Celtic&#39;s first team could have achieved with him. <br><br>He helped Raith Rovers in a golden period for the club, helping them to the second tier title and so promotion to the top tier, where they remained for a long time. Incredibly in season 1951-52 they even finished 5th in the final league standings way ahead of a woeful Celtic side, and similarly in season 1956-57 they finished 4th, just above Celtic who won the league cup that season. So his transfer worked out very well for Andy Young.<br><br>He may have come in mighty handy especially in the following years after his transfer when Celtic really hit their nadir and narrowly escaped from even being relegated. Celtic were poorly run throughout the War Years and for a long time beyond, and possibly the loss of Andy Young is another example of this poor management although poor luck due to circumstances is another arguement too in his case.<br><br>In time, Andy Young was to return to Celtic acting as a scout, and then had the same role for Leeds Utd. He was said to have brought on Tommy Callaghan, Bud Johnston, Doug Rougvie and Ian Porterfield.<br><br>He passed away in 2008.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career<br></h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br><br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">REGIONAL<br>LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr><td width="16%">1944-45</td><td align="center" width="16%">3</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">3</td></tr><tr>  <td width="16%">Goals:</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Honours with none</h3>none<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li><a href="/page/Young%2C+Andrew+-+Pics" target="_self" title="Player Pics"><font color="#0066cc">Player Pics</font></a></li></ul><h3>  Links</h3> <ul><li><a href="/page/World+War+Two" target="_self">World War Two</a><br></li></ul>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  Andy Young: Footballer</h3>Scotsman Obituary: <a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/andy-young-footballer-1-1138030" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/andy-young-footballer-1-1138030</a><br><br>Published on Tuesday 21 October 2008 20:36<br><br>Born: 21 June, 1925, in Oakley, Fife. Died: 17 October, 2008, in Dunfermline, aged 83.<br><br>THERE are Raith Rovers supporters of a certain age who insist that, while Willie McNaught was undoubtedly a fine footballer, deserving of more Scotland caps than the meagre five he collected, their favourite Rovers player was Andy Young. Versatile, consistent, enduring and a match-winner, he was the complete footballer in all but pace. It is no accident that the club&#39;s golden years coincided with Young&#39;s 16 years at Stark&#39;s Park.<br><br>There have been few more effective players in the club&#39;s history than the former miner from Oakley. He was comfortable in any position, such was his all-round ability, and outstanding in midfield or attack.<br><br>To everyone&#39;s astonishment, he did not receive a representative honour. One can only speculate how many caps he would receive in the present day, and he probably suffered from a belief among selectors that one Raith Rovers player in the team was sufficient.<br><br>A powerful header of the ball, with a blistering shot as well as a deft touch, he was a consistent goal scorer through his long and loyal service to the club.<br><br>He attended Blairhall School, near Oakley, and was one of a handful of outstanding players who emerged from this small corner of west Fife. Within four years of his birth, Blairhall also produced future footballing luminaries Charlie Fleming and Tommy Wright, both of East Fife, Sunderland and Scotland, and the Rangers goalkeeper George Niven.<br><br>Young rose to prominence first at Wellwood Juveniles, and then at Steelend Juniors. At 17 years of age, he was recommended to Celtic, played a trial for them at Dumbarton and signed for them, along with Bobby Evans, after the game.<br><br>During his two-year spell at Celtic Park, he made regular first-team appearances but was hampered by the demands of his day job &ndash; he had to combine playing football with working in Blairhall pit, which often meant doing a night shift followed by travelling to Glasgow, or places such as Aberdeen, to turn out for Celtic.<br><br>The travelling forced Young to leave Celtic and go on loan to Raith Rovers in February 1945, making his debut in a 2-1 Northern League defeat to Arbroath. He signed permanently for Raith in September that year, and over the next 16 seasons he would play in every position, including a 20-minute stint as goalkeeper.<br><br>But it was in the half-back line that Andy Young would make his name, firstly as part of the Ernie Till, Young and Tommy Brady partnership that would win the Second Division championship and finish runners-up to Rangers in the League Cup final in 1949.<br><br>The partnership of Young, Harry Colville and Andy Leigh in the early part of the 1950s, and latterly the even more famous Young, McNaught and Leigh trio, were to serve Raith well in an era when the Kirkcaldy club were one of Scotland&#39;s leading lights, and the half-back line revered throughout the country.<br><br>During a discussion about his career and the game in general in the 1950s, Young said: &quot;There wasn&#39;t much by way of tactics or changing positions during a match. If things weren&#39;t going right, no-one thought about how they might change the formation or anything like that. You were picked for your ability to play in a certain position, and you went out and played as well as you could.<br><br>&quot;There can be little doubt that the three wing halves, myself, McNaught and Leigh, would have won many caps for Scotland had we played for a more fashionable team. Andy Leigh got a representative cap against the Army at Newcastle, and McNaught got a handful of caps, but I got no further than being a reserve. We were as good a defensive unit as there was in the game at the time but never got the international recognition we deserved.<br><br>&quot;I often wondered why I was never picked. I watched as players were selected who were no quicker than me and certainly not as good all-round footballers. I could score goals, and others who were picked couldn&#39;t.&quot;<br><br>The highlight of the 1950s golden era was undoubtedly the 5-1 destruction of Rangers at Stark&#39;s Park in December 1956. It was the peak of the greatest Raith Rovers team in 30 years and, for a while, they looked genuine championship contenders, eventually finishing in fourth place, their highest position since 1922 and one that has not been bettered since.<br><br>In all, Young played 611 times for Raith Rovers, his last appearance being a Fife Cup tie against Dunfermline Athletic in May 1960. Only Willie McNaught has played more games for Raith, while Young scored an incredible 141 goals. Not bad for someone who would nowadays be called a defensive midfielder.<br><br>Although he had a three-year stint as manager of Fife junior club Lochore Welfare, it was talent-spotting that Andy loved more than anything else in his post-playing days. As manager at Lochore, he won three Fife Championships and launched the careers of Willie Johnston (Rangers, West Brom, Hearts and Scotland), Ian Porterfield (Raith and Sunderland, then manager of Aberdeen and Chelsea), Arthur Mann (Hearts), Tommy Callaghan (Celtic), Willie Renton (Dunfermline) and Jocky Richardson (Raith Rovers).<br><br>He also scouted for Celtic and Dunfermline Athletic and it is down to Young that Jim Leishman was given his first break in Scottish football.<br><br>Later, he would join his great friend Don Revie at Leeds United, and it was Young who was responsible for Gordon McQueen moving from St Mirren to Elland Road. While on the payroll at Leeds, Young was a guest at the 1973 FA Cup final against Sunderland. It was ironic that one of his protgs &ndash; Porterfield &ndash; should score the winning goal for Sunderland.<br><br>Young retired from football in 1994, having resisted Jimmy Nicholl&#39;s attempts to lure him back to Raith Rovers in a scouting role. He did return to Stark&#39;s Park many times as a member of the newly formed Raith Rovers Former Players Association, in which he held the post of honorary president.

He spent 16 years as a Raith Rovers player - his time at Stark&#39;s  Park being an era among the finest in the club&#39;s history.  <div>    He was born in the Fife mining village of Oakley and was educated at  the nearby Blairhall School. Mining communities frequently produced  outstanding footballers and, following in Young&#39;s footsteps, Charlie  Fleming and Tommy Wright (East Fife, Sunderland and Scotland) and the  Rangers goalkeeper George Niven were born in Blairhall.     Young, almost inevitably, went down the mines, but found an outlet in  football, first, at Wellwood Juveniles, and then at Steelend Victoria.  Aged 17, he played a trial for Dunfermline Athletic before being  recommended to Celtic, signing on February 5, 1943, in former manager  Willie Maley&#39;s Bank Restaurant in Queen Street, Glasgow, following a  trial match at Dumbarton.     A wing-half or inside-forward, it was 12 months before the Fife  youngster made his Celtic debut, partnering the legendary Jimmy Delaney  on the right wing in a 2-2 home draw with Hibernian in a Southern League  fixture on February 12, 1944. He had received a signing-on fee of &pound;20  from manager Jimmy McStay and earned &pound;2 in the first-team, &pound;1 in the  reserves - but opportunities were somewhat restricted during the war,  with Young working full-time down the pits. Two more appearances the  following season were his lot at Parkhead and he was freed in the summer  of 1945.     He would find his spiritual home in Kirkcaldy, having joined Raith  Rovers on loan the previous February, making his debut in a 1-2  North-Eastern League defeat at Arbroath, then signing for the club on a  permanent basis the following September in return for a &pound;75 signing-on  fee.     Young would develop into a consistent footballer of outstanding  ability - resourceful, strong in the air and with a powerful drive, an  attacking midfielder to use the modern parlance. He was also more than  capable of adapting to several positions, including that of goalkeeper,  taking his turn between the posts at Dumfries for 20 minutes.     The Second Division Championship was won in 1948-49, while at the same  time Rovers reached the League Cup final - going down 0-2 to Rangers.     By then Young had evolved into a superb wing-half, perhaps a lack of  pace being his only failing. In January 1951 Derby County offered  &pound;10,000 for his signature - but the player was reluctant to leave his  native Fife.     He would be a member of not one but two truly outstanding half-back  lines with Raith, first with Harry Colville and Andy Leigh, then with  Willie McNaught and Leigh. That League Cup final of 1949 was the closest  Young would come to major trophy success - suffering semi-final defeat  in the Scottish Cup of 1951, 1956 and 1957 and the St Mungo Cup of 1951.     Season 1956-57 was perhaps the summit of that fine Rovers side. On one  never-to-be-forgotten winter&#39;s day on December 8, 1956, reigning league  champions Rangers were overwhelmed 5-1 at Stark&#39;s Park. Rovers would  eventually finish in fourth position that season, their highest league  placement since 1924, and one that has not been equalled in the past  half-century. A controversial Scottish Cup semi-final replay defeat to  Falkirk at Tynecastle was a bitter pill to swallow, and Raith would  never come so close again.     In all, Young played 611 games for Raith, an appearance record  bettered only by Willie McNaught, scoring a remarkable 141 goals. He was  one of the most popular players in the club&#39;s history, yet incredibly  did not receive a single representative honour. It has been said that  had he played for a bigger club, he would surely have received  international recognition - but how can a club that produced players of  the class of Alex James and Jim Baxter be described as unfashionable?     In his later years at Stark&#39;s Park he had an influence on the young  Jim Baxter, and after retiring in 1960 he was manager of junior club  Lochore Welfare for six years, helping to develop the careers of Willie  Johnston, Tommy Callaghan, Arthur Mann and Ian Porterfield, and winning  three consecutive Fife Junior League titles.     He later scouted for Celtic, Dunfermline and Leeds United (under  manager Don Revie). He took future Scottish internationalist Gordon  McQueen to Elland Road and at Wembley in 1973 he saw one of his &quot;old  boys&quot; - Porterfield - score the winner for Sunderland in the FA Cup  final.     He was honorary president of Raith Rovers Former Players&#39; Association,  continuing to live in the same Lochgelly house he and his wife had  occupied since 1951.     Young died in Queen Margaret Hospital, Dunfermline, after a short  illness and is survived by his wife Jessie, son Ian and granddaughter  Gemma.
