Brown was excellent too.<br><br>Ciftci took his goal well and did well for Brown&#39;s too.<br><br>Some great goals and some great attacking football. Magic.<br><br>(Fboab of KDS)<br>Terrific performance today, could easily have been double figures. Rogic  was fabulous, and passes the ball forwards into the area, which we  haven&#39;t been doing. Forrest and Commons were also terrific, and we kept a  high tempo all over the pitch. No real failures today, and Izzy nearly  brought the house down . What a shampooe penalty though .<br>More defensive performances like this will help too, Efe and Boyata should be very happy with the clean sheet.<br>Rogic should keep his place for now, and Ciftci made his best cameo yet, and the goal will help him no end.<br>All in all , the most entertaining game in ages. 						 						 						 					<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Teams</font></h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Gordon         </li><li>    22  Janko         </li><li>    04  Ambrose         </li><li>    20  Boyata         </li><li>    03  Izaguirre         </li><li>    08  Brown         </li><li>    06  Bitton         </li><li>    15  Commons      (Mackay-Steven - 63&#39;

3-1 win at Hearts earlier in the afternoon had taken them eight points clear of the champions at the top of the table but Ronny Deila&rsquo;s side turned in their best performance of the season to demoralise the Dens Park men.<br><br>Returning midfielder Tom Rogic scored with a volley in the 14th minute before setting up Leigh Griffiths two minutes later for the Hoops&rsquo; second goal and the striker&rsquo;s 10th of the season.<br><br>Left-back Emilio Izaguirre, sent off in the 2-2 draw with Ajax in their Europa League Group A opener in Amsterdam on Thursday night, scored twice in six second-half minutes before missing a penalty for his hat-trick.<br><br>Skipper Scott Brown and substitute Nadir Ciftci added late goals with the Turk scoring for the first time since signing from Dundee United in the summer.<br><br>And while Aberdeen stretched their winning run since the start of the season to eight games, Celtic&rsquo;s performance will be a reminder that there is still a long way to go in the title race.<br><br>Deila freshened up his side from the trip to Holland.<br><br>Saidy Janko came in for Mikael Lustig at right-back, Efe Ambrose replaced Jozo Simunovic in central defence with Rogic in for Stefan Johansen.<br><br>In-form Griffiths had three attempts on goal before Rogic&rsquo;s opener; a free-kick which sped inches wide, a drive just over the bar and a full-blooded shot which Dundee&rsquo;s over-worked keeper Scott Bain saved at point-blank range.<br><br>When Rogic was given his chance from an Izaguirre cut-back he made no mistake, volleying past Bain from 12 yards.<br><br>The Australian then turned provider two minutes later, powering down the left before chipping to Griffiths who took the ball past James McPake before rifling into the net from eight yards.<br><br>The Taysiders could not find any respite.<br><br>In the 20th minute Bain pulled off a fantastic diving save from Rogic&rsquo;s thunderous right-footed effort, before James Forrest&rsquo;s shot from the edge of the box swerved wide of the far post.<br><br>Another Bain save from Rogic followed, as did a drive by Forrest and an attempt by Kris Commons as Dundee&rsquo;s defence was opened at will.<br><br>In the 41st minute, in a rare Dees attack, Brown fouled Nicky Low at the edge of the box with Celtic keeper Craig Gordon making a decent save from Gary Harkins&rsquo; free-kick and Kane Hemmings knocked the rebound over the bar.<br><br>But there was time before the break for Forrest to crack a shot off the bar and Bain to save again from Rogic.<br><br>The procession towards the Dundee goal continued in the second-half and a clever one-two between Izaguirre and Commons ended with the Honduras international driving past the helpless Bain.<br><br>Griffiths then made way for Ciftci but it was Izaguirre who grabbed number four when Janko&rsquo;s deflected cross allowed him to knock the ball in from a yard out.<br><br>Callum McGregor and Gary Mackay-Stevens replaced Forrest and Commons respectively and in the 64th minute, when McGregor was fouled in the box by Dundee defender Gary Irvine, referee Steven McLean gave Izaguirre the chance to grab his hat-trick from the spot but he blasted wildly over the bar.<br><br>Ciftci had the ball in the net after Bain had fumbled but referee McLean signalled for an infringement in the box.<br><br>However, moments after the Turkish striker had picked out Brown in the 86th minute to slide in number five from 12 yards, Ciftci capitalised on a slack Irvine back pass to race through and break his duck and make it number six by slipping the ball past Bain.  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br>By Richard Wilson BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br><br>Celtic delivered a timely reminder of their commanding nature with an impressive sweeping aside of Dundee.<br><br>The visitors could not suppress Celtic&#39;s cutting edge or endeavour, and were quickly two goals behind thanks to Tom Rogic and Leigh Griffiths.<br><br>Emilio Izaguirre took over the scoring after the break, striking twice and also missing a penalty.<br><br>That was a rare moment of relief for a subdued Dundee, who conceded further goals to Scott Brown and Nadir Ciftci.<br><br>Soon after this game kicked off, Aberdeen scored to lead 3-0 at Tynecastle. The Celtic players would have been unaware of that fact - although plenty of the home fans were following events on the other side of the country - but they are alert enough to the pressure being applied by Derek McInnes&#39;s side.<br><br>Celtic, the defending champions, are currently in pursuit of the league leaders. They were certainly quick to respond against Dundee, taking full advantage of the visitors sitting too deep and being wasteful in possession.<br>Touch of class<br>Australian midfielder Tom Rogic opened the scoring against Dundee<br><br>Australian midfielder Tom Rogic opened the scoring against Dundee<br><br>The latter issues riled Paul Hartley, but the Dundee manager would no doubt concede that they were in part a response to Celtic&#39;s attacking intent. Griffiths had already sent a free-kick into the side netting and another chance over before the home side scored.<br><br>Dundee often had 10 men behind the ball, but Celtic had the refinement of touch and imagination to break through the lines. They were well served on the flanks, too, and Brown&#39;s deft pass released Izaguirre down the left and his cross was expertly volleyed into the net by Rogic.<br><br>The Australian attacking midfielder grew into a commanding presence. Tall, rangy, powerful and with a delicate touch, he provided all the qualities that Celtic have missed while Stefan Johansen has suffered a dip in form. He might have scored again, but after a brilliant surging run he saw his shot pushed away by Bain, and the Dundee goalkeeper was also equal to another volley later in the first half.<br><br>Celtic were comfortably in front long before then. Rogic turned provider two minutes after opening the scoring, crossing for Griffiths who took the ball on his chest, stepped past Gary Irvine then drilled a shot past Bain.<br>Deep Dark Blues<br>Paul Hartley looks on in horror as his Dundee team leak six goals<br><br>Paul Hartley looks on in horror as his Dundee team leak six goals<br><br>Hartley was infuriated on the touchline, mostly because his team was so deep. When they did have the ball, they tended to be ponderous, although Paul McGinn did manage a long run down the right that ended with him falling to the ground inside the area as Efe Ambrose challenged, but half-hearted penalty appeals were turned away by the referee Steven McLean.<br><br>The visitors could not devise a more effective game plan during the interval and it took just one minute of the second half for Rogic to deliver another shot on target, that Bain again saved. Torment continued for the visitors, and Izaguirre finished nearly from close range with his right foot after a one-two with Kris Commons sent him into the area.<br><br>For all that his defensive nous is questioned, Izaguirre can be irrepressible going forward and he struck again when a cross from his fellow full-back Saido Janko was deflected to the back post and into his path.<br><br>Only sentiment could disrupt Celtic&#39;s poise. When Callum McGregor was pulled back inside the area by a forlorn Irvine, the home fans shouted for Izaguirre to take the spot kick. He was handed the ball, but then wildly blazed it over the bar and spent he next few minutes of the game shaking his head in disbelief.<br>Breakthrough for Ciftci<br>Nadir Ciftci celebrates after scoring his first goal for Celtic<br><br>Nadir Ciftci scored his first goal for Celtic since his move from Dundee United<br><br>Nadir Ciftci thought he had finally broken his duck for Celtic near the end, but a foul was awarded on Bain just before Ciftci tucked the ball into the empty net from McGregor&#39;s free-kick. The Celtic fans booed the decision, but it was a minor complaint on a satisfying afternoon for the home fans at Celtic Park.<br><br>Ciftci also wasn&#39;t finished. Moments later, he crossed for Brown to clip the ball past Bain, and then the former Dundee United striker did grab a goal, latching on to a loose passback and poking the ball past Bain.<br><br>There was loud acclaim for the goal, and for the scoreline.<br><br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 6, Dundee 0.<br>90:00 +2:26 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 6, Dundee 0.<br>90:00 +0:19<br><br>Attempt missed.
