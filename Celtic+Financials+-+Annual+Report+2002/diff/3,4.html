Until this process has run its course, the share prices of quoted football clubs can be expected to remain depressed.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The situation in Scotland differs from that in England and other leading European countries in two important respects: first, Scottish Premier League clubs&#39; income from <a href="/page/media" target="_self">media</a> contracts generally represents a smaller proportion of their total revenues than their counterparts elsewhere; secondly, the expiry of the existing contracts at the close of last season gave Scottish clubs less time to adjust to the changing <a href="/page/media" target="_self">media</a> climate.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>In these circumstances it is hardly surprising that tensions arose within the Scottish Premier League, throwing doubt on the future of the competition.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Nor should it be surprising against this background, that Celtic explored suggestions that they might consider joining the Nationwide Football League along with <a href="/page/Rangers" target="_self">Rangers</a>.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>In the event, this possibility did not develop beyond an exploratory stage.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>I believe the factors which prompted us to explore such possibilities will not disappear; and we will continue to be receptive to structural change, while maintaining our stance of not abandoning Scottish football.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>How these objectives are reconciled is, of course, a challenge.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We believe it can be done, with goodwill on all sides.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>On the field, Celtic won the Scottish Premier League for the second successive season, the first time we had achieved this in 20 years.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The Championship was won with only one loss in 38 games, with a record number of points and in front of an average home league attendance of over 58,000 spectators.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We reached the semi-final and final of the Scottish League and Scottish FA cups respectively. Our first ever participation in the UEFA Champions&#39; League was exciting and promising, winning all of our home games and only narrowly failing to proceed to the second stage.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Particular mention must be made of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s exceptional contribution to our football success.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We will make every effort to renew his contract.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The financial benefits arising from our successes domestically and in Europe allowed us to improve significantly our financial performance in a number of ways.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Turnover rose by over one-third and multi-<a href="/page/media" target="_self">media</a> revenues by almost two thirds in comparison to the previous year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Profit from operations rose from under <span class="diffRemove">#1</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;1</span> million in <a href="/page/2000" target="_self">2000</a>/<a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2001</a> to over <span class="diffRemove">#5</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;5</span> million in the year just ended; the loss before taxation was reduced from over <span class="diffRemove">#11</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;11</span> million to under <span class="diffRemove">#3</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;3</span> million; net assets, benefiting from the successful share issue last summer, rose from <span class="diffRemove">#30</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;30</span> million to just over <span class="diffRemove">#47</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;47</span> million and net debt fell from around #30 million to <span class="diffRemove">#16.5</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;16.5</span> million.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Further investment was made in the playing squad, and expenditure on player remuneration and youth development increased by over 25%. Football labour costs at 49.2% of total turnover continue to be well below the average of the sector. Nevertheless we recognise the need to control our player costs going forward.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Looking ahead, we believe we can maintain the progress in carrying forward the strategy for the club determined by the Board two years ago.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Success in domestic competition remains fundamental and we hope that participation in the Champions&#39; League would allow us to continue the work of strengthening our football infrastructure, our business base and our finances.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Finally, my thanks go to our supporters and to our footballers for a successful and exciting year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Celtic is a unique football family with aspirations to match our traditions.<span class="diffRemove">   </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>CHIEF EXECUTIVE&#39;S REVIEW<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Introduction<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The on field performance of Celtic continued successfully during the course of last year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Domestically, we reached the semi final of the <a href="/page/League+Cup" target="_self">League Cup</a>, the final of the <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup" target="_self">Scottish Cup</a> and most importantly, gained 103 points in the Scottish Premier League, retaining the Championship as a result.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The retention of the title was greatly assisted by the team&#39;s form at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a>, where we remained undefeated in all our League games.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Success has been particularly important this year, as it provides us with the only Scottish opportunity to qualify and subsequently participate in the group stages of the UEFA Champions&#39; League.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Such participation motivates the team, stimulates the support and provides the Club with much needed incremental income.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Last year&#39;s performance was very encouraging, remaining undefeated at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a> in the first group stage of the Champions&#39; League and narrowly missing qualification for the second group stage. We were also unfortunate in our <a href="/page/UEFA+Cup" target="_self">UEFA Cup</a> tie with Valencia, losing on penalties to a side who had competed in the previous two Champions&#39; League finals.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Financial Performance<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Integral to Celtic&#39;s strategy has been the belief that success on the football field will drive turnover improvements in all other areas of the Company.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>This belief has been borne out by the results for the full year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Turnover rose substantially to <span class="diffRemove">#56.89m;</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;56.89m;</span> an increase of 35.4% on the previous year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The buoyant turnover performance resulted in an encouraging increase in profit from operations to <span class="diffRemove">#5.37m</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;5.37m</span> against a figure of only <span class="diffRemove">#0.87m</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;0.87m</span> for the previous financial year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The reported loss before tax is <span class="diffRemove">#2.97m,</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;2.97m,</span> which is also a significant improvement on the previous year, where an <span class="diffRemove">#11.19m</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;11.19m</span> loss before tax was declared.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Further financial improvement has also been seen in the reduction of Celtic&#39;s indebtedness.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>As at 1 July <a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2001</a>, the net debt at Celtic was almost <span class="diffRemove">#30m.  </span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;30m. </span>This was within the structure of our financial arrangements but was nonetheless higher than was desirable.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>During the financial year, we have managed our debt position carefully and at 30 June <a href="/page/2002" target="_self">2002</a>, it stood at <span class="diffRemove">#16.47m,</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;16.47m,</span> a year on year reduction of 44%.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Our financial management has therefore made strong progress in a high cost, high inflation market.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Football Investment<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>In order to maintain our on field success, we have continued to invest in the <a href="/page/first+team+squad" target="_self">first team squad</a>.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Five new <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> were acquired, namely Balde, Guppy, Sylla, Hartson and latterly Fernandez.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The gross investment cost this year in the acquisition of <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> equates to <span class="diffRemove">#12.11m.  </span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;12.11m. </span>A further <span class="diffRemove">#2.50m</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;2.50m</span> investment was made in follow-up capital payments due against <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> acquired in previous years.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>It is also important to recognise that the trend in football following the Bosman ruling is to re-negotiate and extend contracts to <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> important to the team in order that we retain <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> of calibre.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Consistent with this approach, the Club successfully concluded contract extension discussions with ten key <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> including Agathe, Crainey, Lambert, Larsson, Mjallby and Petta, all of whom are important contributors to the <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">first team </span><span class="diffRemove">squad</span><span class="diffRemove">.  </span><span class="diffAdd">squad. </span>Our strong football investment policy has contributed to a rise in overall labour costs of 26.4% to <span class="diffRemove">#32.74m.  </span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;32.74m. </span>This represents 57.6% of turnover, which confirms the intent of the <a href="/page/Celtic+Board" target="_self">Celtic Board</a> to retain a controlled ratio between wage cost and total income.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Nonetheless, the ability to field a competitive side and retain control on costs remains a constant challenge.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>This situation is symptomatic of the increased level of investment undertaken in recent years in relation to both increases in player pay and the transfer fees paid to acquire calibre <a href="/page/players" target="_self">players</a>.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The latter investment cost is written down in equal proportion throughout the length of individual <span class="diffRemove">players</span><span class="diffRemove">&#39;</span><span class="diffAdd">players&#39;</span> contracts and has a substantial impact in eroding profit from operations generated in the year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Football Operations<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>For the commencement of season <a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2001</a>/<a href="/page/2002" target="_self">2002</a>, Celtic applied an average season ticket price rise of 20%.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Whilst prices had remained static for the previous two seasons, such a position could not be maintained if we were to continue our player investment strategy.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>It was recognised that this placed significant additional burden on our supporters and to their credit, they renewed tickets in line with the previous year with a total of 53,457 supporters purchasing season tickets.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We are grateful for their continued support.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Our Champions&#39; League games provided further opportunity to grow ticket sales and the combination of the ticket price rise and Champions&#39; League participation, led to a 27.8% overall increase in football revenue to <span class="diffRemove">#27.72m.  </span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;27.72m. </span>It was recognised that supporters had to pay a substantial premium to renew their domestic season ticket.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>As a result, ticket prices for the qualifying tie and those for the first group stage of the Champions&#39; League were priced competitively and a<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>discount was offered if a supporter elected to purchase a ticket package to incorporate all three Champions&#39; League home games.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>This approach resulted in a virtual sell-out for each of the three home matches.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Youth Development<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Youth Development is an important part of Celtic&#39;s strategy for the future with 45 professional <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> up to the age of 21 under contract.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>12 Under-21 <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">players</span> played for the first team, 5 of them competitively within domestic competition, gaining almost 60 appearances amongst them.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Our strength in depth was further evidenced by winning the SPL Under-21 trophy as well as the League Championship and also coming runner up in the Under-18 League.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>However, we are still looking to improve further in this area.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We have recruited John Stephenson, formerly Head of Youth Development at Preston North End, to support Tommy Burns in improving our scouting and coaching network.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The number of Celtic scouts has been trebled in the last twelve months and is set to grow further.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Our training facilities at Barrowfield have been enhanced with the addition of two further training pitches with further plans to improve the building infrastructure.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We also have Celtic Youth teams at U-12, U-13, U-14 and U-15, selected throughout the country with a view to developing their skills and assessing their potential as future professionals.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>A number of new coaching appointments were made during the year to improve management within this area.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>It has been important for Celtic to develop and improve its Youth Development infrastructure and this has been the priority for this financial year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Options for a purpose-built Training Academy are currently being considered.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Youth Development is a sizeable investment for the Club and a significant contribution to its cost emanates from Celtic Development Pools donations. Celtic Pools has over 1,000 agents collecting weekly contributions from 38,000 supporters.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Both the Pools and the half-time draw are the most successful football schemes of their kind throughout Great Britain, which is a very positive result in a market now dominated by the National Lottery.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Stadium Development<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Included in the total season ticket sales are almost 3,000 corporate hospitality purchases.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span><a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a> provides matchday catering in twelve different lounges and dining facilities in addition to a series of corporate boxes.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>A further dining facility (&quot;Number 7&quot;) for the premium end of the market was added during the course of the financial year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Standards of service and quality of catering have been a constant source of attention.<span class="diffRemove">   </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Improvements have been made and it is our intention to maintain an appropriate standard in each of these areas.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>There are further plans to improve levels of food service within concourse catering and focus will also be placed on increasing non-matchday sales to grow income further.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We have also invested in an extensive refurbishment programme within a number of existing corporate facilities in order to improve standards of presentation.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Multi <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">Media</span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Multi <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">media</span> income grew by 63.7% to #16.22m.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Champions&#39; League participation provided an opportunity for Celtic to significantly increase its <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">media</span> income through our share of the UEFA TV pool. This was a most welcome contribution to income but regrettably the level of income is not solely based on success within the competition but is driven by population size and TV audience within the home country.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>As a result, Olympique Lyonnais earned<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>triple the income from the TV pool in comparison to Celtic despite achieving the same number of league points within the competition.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>It is hoped that through the newly established UEFA Club Forum, there will be an opportunity to challenge this arrangement.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Our investment in new <a href="/page/media" target="_self">media</a> continues with daily internet transmissions to supporters from our website.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We have also launched a text messaging service providing supporters with the opportunity to receive game updates and <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">news</span> bulletins direct to their mobile phone.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We continue to experiment with live game production and transmission on the Celtic website with a total of six games being transmitted during the course of the season.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Celtic has also gained close to 200,000 registered users of the website in over 200 countries, indicating the scale and potential income source from an international supporter base. Research will continue this year to identify this potential more closely.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>This aspect of our fan base provides Celtic with a further potential income opportunity, provided new <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">media</span> rights are retained by the Club.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Merchandising<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Merchandising grew by 30% within the year to <span class="diffRemove">#10.0m,</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;10.0m,</span> predominantly driven by replica strip sales.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The stores benefited from continued strong sales of the home top launched the previous year and the replacement away top launched last September.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Internet and mail order sales reached almost <span class="diffRemove">#1m</span><span class="diffAdd">&pound;1m</span> with room for further growth.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>However, we recognise that we need to continue to improve ease of website navigation and a new distribution facility at <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a> has also been developed to improve customer delivery times and the efficiency of store replenishment.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We also opened a new store in Edinburgh last November.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>A further store in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, opened in early July <a href="/page/2002" target="_self">2002</a>, extending the total number of stores to nine.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>New product ranges within the stores are also introduced regularly in order to grow sales of fashion items and casual wear.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>This has proved very successful with strong growth in both ladies and childrenswear during the year.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>As part of our Brand Management plan, we also published and co-wrote the recent <a href="/page/Moravcik%2C+Lubo" target="_self"><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">Lubo Moravcik</span></a> biography, which to date has sold over 5,000 copies.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Summary<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Since the Bosman ruling, transfer fees and player pay has seen substantial growth.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Football clubs have seen very high cost inflation particularly if they wish to compete in European competition.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">Media</span> income has helped reduce the impact of these cost rises but as the advertising and <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">media</span> market hardens, it has become increasingly difficult to rely on <span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link">media</span> income to continue as a guaranteed and growing source of revenue.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Celtic has therefore been faced with a rising cost base but has been successful in maintaining control over these costs, whilst still delivering on-field success.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The hardening of the <a href="/page/media" target="_self">media</a> market was felt severely by the SPL during the course of the season, which included a feasibility study on the development of an independent pay television channel for Scottish football.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>It was appropriate to assess the potential of such a venture but the final analysis indicated high risk both to subscription levels expected and potential liabilities.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>The resultant rejection of the concept has led to deep divisions within the SPL, which unfortunately remain unresolved.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>Celtic has a responsibility to Scottish football but we also have a duty to our shareholders and our supporters to act in the interests of <a href="/page/Celtic+Football+Club" target="_self">Celtic Football Club</a>.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>To this end, we retain an open mind to discussions on structural change within Europe and recognise that the problems facing Scottish football are felt similarly in other smaller European countries also.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>We remain optimistic that structural change will occur providing a more level playing field for football competition within Europe and further opportunities for the growth and future success of Celtic as a result.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>People<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>I have great confidence in our team here at Celtic.<span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd"> </span>At every level and in every area of this Club we are fortunate to have deeply committed<span class="diffRemove">
