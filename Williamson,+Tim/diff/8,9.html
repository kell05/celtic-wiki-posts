Glaswegian Williamson was at George Graham&rsquo;s Spurs for two years as head academy physiotherapist, joined Leeds United in a similar role and stayed for two years before moving to Celtic and was building a reputation as a very dependable physiotherapist. MacDonald as club doctor and head of the Clinical Services at the club, assessed that another first team physio was required to cope with the expanding work load and to bring in new techniques and procedures for the recuperation of first team players.<br><br>His appointment appears to have marked the start of the slow exit by Brian Scott from the club. Scott was alleged to want Williamson to be seen as subordinate to his position. This appears to have led to a rift between MacDonald and Scott which culminated in allegations being made and an ultimatum being given to Martin O&#39;Neill by Roddy MacDonald that it was &quot;.....either he goes or I do.&quot; Brian Scott was sacked by the club in August 2003 after 25 years with the club and went on to sue the club for unfair dismissal in a very public court case in September 2004. Tim Williamson became Head Physiotherapist after Scott was sacked.<br><br>Williamson had a very good relationship with the first team players - a very necessary part of being an effective member of the clinical coaching staff - and he appeared to have the complete confidence of the players. He continued with Celtic after Martin O&#39;Neill left the club taking most of the back room staff with him to Aston Villa (including renowned long term Fitness and Conditioning and Sprint coach Jim Henry).<br><br>However at the end of the 2007 - 2008 season Williamson left for Birmingham City.<br><br><span class="diffRemove">He joined Alex McLeish at Birmingham City for the start of the 2008-09 season and immediately set about instituting changes in the way injured players were dealt with and generally upgrading The Blues Physio department. McLeish had known Williamson from when he had worked as a part-time physiotherapist at Hibernian during the period he was studying for his Physiotherapy degree at Edinburgh University.</span><span class="diffRemove">  </span>Neil Lennon appears to have targeted Williamson for a return to his Celtic, after having built up a good rapport with him during his playing days. With Lennon&#39;s appointment as the new Manager he set out to lure him back to Glasgow. On 5th July 2010 Birmingham City announced that Williamson would leave Birmingham to rejoin Celtic - right at the start of pre-season training for Birmingham.<br><br>He returns as first team Physiotherapist at a time when the club are seeking to appoint ageing gveteran players from the Premiership and free signings from other clubs.<div></div><div><span class="diffAdd">Williamson was seen as a vital part of Lennons backroom team during the 4 year reign, he was also seen as a close friend to Lennon.</span></div><div></div><div><span class="diffAdd">In 2012 after a board level decision to reshape the medical department Williamson replaced Dr MacDonald as Head of Sports Medicine working with other club physios and voluntary Dr Sharpe. Williamson is well respected within his role and as stated above has a great working relationship with the first team squad.</span></div><div></div><div><span class="diffAdd">When Lennon left Celtic in 2014 just as happened before Williamson remained at the club, in Ronny Deila&#39;s first season he was seen as an important figure but after some disagreements and Deila&#39;s want to bring in his own staff he was replaced by injury prevention specialist Grete Homstoll in January 2016 although as a request of the CEO he remained at the club as a physio.</span></div><div></div><div><span class="diffAdd">In May 2016 along with Deila, Collins and co, Homstoll departed Celtic. After the appointment of Brendan Rodgers Williamson was reinstated to the top medical role at the club and is now found in the dug out week in week out working close with new head of performance Glenn Driscoll and the manager himself.</span><br><br><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">External Links:</span></h3><br><br><ul><li><a class="external" href="http://sport.scotsman.com/top-stories/Celtic-physio-was-embarrassment.2562032.jp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Celtic Physio was an embarrassment</span></a><span class="diffFormatting" title=""> - 7th September, 2004</span><br></li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/birmingham-city-fc/2008/07/25/new-faces-in-birmingham-city-backroom-team-65233-21408669/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">New Faces in Birmingham City backroom team - 25th July, 2008</span><br></a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2008/08/08/we-will-not-cut-corners-says-birmingham-city-physio-tim-williamson-97319-21499651/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">We will not cut corners says Birmingham City Physio Tim Williamson - 8th August, 2008</span><br></a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/birmingham-city-fc/birmingham-city-fc-news/2010/07/05/birmingham-city-physio-to-leave-club-97319-26785038/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Birmingham City Physio to leave the Club</span></a><span class="diffFormatting" title=""> - 5th July, 2010</span><br></li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.pressreader.com/uk/scottish-daily-mail/20160130/283021168700590" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="If Deila Sinks, It will be with his crew"><span class="diffAdd">If Deila Sinks, It will be with his crew</span></a><span class="diffAdd">30th January, 2016</span><br></li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3601298/Brendan-Rodgers-named-new-Celti
