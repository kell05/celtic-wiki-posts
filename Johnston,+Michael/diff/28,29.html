Celtic had just beaten TheRangers 5-1 at Ibrox a week ago, and were heading for the treble under Brendan Rodgers (Scottish Cup final to go), so in the league there was room to provide appearances for the upcoming juniors who had been making a name for themselves with a clutch of recent trophies. Michael Johnston was one of the cream of the crop, with stories that Chelsea were interested in him after he earned rave reviews. <br><br>Mikey Johston was given the thumbs up by a supportive Brendan Rodgers:<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;Young Mikey, you see the profile of player I like. He came in to  replace Scott Sinclair, which is never easy but I felt he came in and  did very well.</i>  <i>&ldquo;Again, he&rsquo;s a very exciting player. He&rsquo;s fast and his maturation  level isn&rsquo;t like Tony&rsquo;s [Ralston]&ndash; he still has a lot of growth left in him - but  he&rsquo;s just turned 18. He&rsquo;s dynamic and, once he becomes a little bit  better on the final pass and can add goals, then he&rsquo;s going to be a big  talent.</i><br><br></blockquote>Came to the attention of many in June 2018, when Scotland reached the semi-finals of the Toulan U21s tournament just prior to the 2018 World Cup, only to lose 3-1 to England U21s, but Mikey Johnston scored the sole Scotland U21s goal: Johnston collected as pass from on the left  wing, then deftly slalomed his way in and out of two English defenders which propelled him into the box, where he still had the one in front of him.                                                                                                         Johnston beat him for pace before whipping in a brilliant shot, which proved too much for the keeper as it fizzed past him into the net.It was a brilliant strike. He was to be voted in the tournament as one of the top three players. He again came to the forefront with a fine chip goal v Standard Liege in a friendly in 2017, and his name was being widely referenced. <br><blockquote><br></blockquote><div>He came to attention when given chances in late 2018 when injuries availed him of some opportunities, and v Motherwell in Dec 2018 he blew up on the scene with an exceptional world class goal which was from the edge of the box which was chip &amp; shot hybrid goal which all applauded. He was showing his talent. As Celtic had faltered of late, his form and various other youngsters that night really gave hope for the future for Celtic youth academy players (there were four on the field that night). A later surprise appearance v Sevco later in the season saw criticism, only for Mikey Johnstone to silence them all with a great two goal scoring match the week following (even overshadowing young Dembele). He was showing his value, but he was young and there was a new manager (Neill Lennon) to impress.</div><div></div><div></div><div><br><b>Neil Lennon era</b><br>[...]<br><br><br>  <table align="bottom"

deal</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/12568<br>By: Mark Henderson on 06 May, 2017 19:29<br><br>CELTIC is delighted to announce that highly-rated youngster Michael Johnston has today signed a new three-year deal with the club.<br><br>The 18-year-old put pen to paper in Paradise a matter of minutes after making his competitive debut for the Hoops in the 4-1 victory over St Johnstone to complete an unforgettable day for the winger.<br><br>Part of the Celtic Youth Academy since the age of nine, Johnston has enjoyed an impressive season for the Development Side and he played a starring role in their 3-0 Youth Cup victory over Rangers last week at Hampden.<br><br>It was these types of performances which prompted Brendan Rodgers to hand Johnston his Celtic bow this afternoon against the Perth side.<br><br>And the manager was thrilled at how Johnston and fellow teenager, Anthony Ralston, acquitted themselves in another sparkling showing from the six-in-a-row champions.<br><br>Speaking exclusively to the official website after penning his new contract, Johnston said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a really special day and I&rsquo;m absolutely delighted. I have played for this club for about 10 years and I have supported them my full life so to make my debut and then sign the contract today and commit my future here is unbelievable.<br><br>&ldquo;It was literally straight after the final whistle. Once I got changed, I went straight in and got the deal signed. I knew it was happening and it all came on the right day.<br><br>&ldquo;I have committed my future here for a reason. This is where I want to be and hopefully I can get many more appearances under my belt.<br><br>&ldquo;This is the club I have supported all of my life so it&rsquo;s always easier when they come in with a new contract offer. I wanted to get it done very quickly so I could focus on playing for Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;Making my debut was one of my goals this season and to do that was a delight and to sign the contract just topped it off.<br><br>&ldquo;All my family were there when I signed and it was a special day. They were all delighted for me and they were a bit emotional when I was playing as well. All of them were really happy for me.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;This has been a great season for Celtic, one of the best in the club&rsquo;s history, and it&rsquo;s something you want to be part of. I will be aiming to get more games under my belt and keep improving and doing what the gaffer the asking me to do.<br><br>&ldquo;I wanted to go out and play with a freedom and show I have the personality to put on the jersey, play well and not let the nerves get the better of me.<br><br>&ldquo;I had a couple of good chances that I probably should have taken but hopefully I get more chances and more goals in the future.&quot;<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s Head of Youth, Chris McCart was delighted to see such a promising player commit his future to the club.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;We only really started about extending his contract a week ago so it&rsquo;s a credit to him and his family that we were able to do it so quickly.<br><br>&ldquo;His agents Lee Robinson and Lee Naylor came in and they were very good to deal with along with Michael, so it was very quickly put together, and the timing couldn&rsquo;t have been better with him making his competitive debut and signing a new three-year contract at the same time.<br><br>&ldquo;Michael has had a very good season working with Tommy McIntyre and Jim McGuinness. He has been at the Academy since the age of nine, and he has put a lot of effort and dedication in.<br><br>&ldquo;He has always been a Celtic fan, along with his family, and they have been waiting for the day when he would make his debut and I felt he had an excellent one. He was well received by the fans and he was appreciated by his team-mates.<br><br>&ldquo;It was a credit to the manager, who has seen all the talent and the potential in Michael, to offer him the opportunity of his first-team debut.<br><br><div>&ldquo;He has went through a lot of growing in the last 18 months height-wise and now what he needs is more sports science, all the proper diet and nutrition, along with developing all the other aspects of his game, which will make him more well rounded to realise his potential.&rdquo;</div><div></div><h3><br>From The Scotsman Jun 2018</h3>Read more at: https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/what-s-in-store-for-celtic-s-raft-of-attacking-midfielders-next-season-1-4761792Michael JohnstonAnother impressive left-sided attacker at Celtic Park, Michael Johnston was excellent for Scotland during the Toulon Tournament in France last month. He netted a wonderful solo goal against England and was included in the competition&rsquo;s best XI, while he finished third for player of the tournament.His performances were that of a player who was telling Brendan Rodgers that he was there, ready and waiting for his chance.Johnston is ready for first-team football having already made his first-team debut. Featuring regularly for Celtic may be a step too far, he should be seen somewhere this season in the Ladbrokes Premiership.<br><br><h3><br>Mikey Johnston has a &lsquo;lovely arrogance&rsquo; says Brendan Rodgers<br></h3>Stephen Halliday<br><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/mikey-johnston-has-a-lovely-arrogance-says-brendan-rodgers-1-4770081" target="_self">https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/mikey-johnston-has-a-lovely-arrogance-says-brendan-rodgers-1-4770081</a><br><br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has played down the prospect of Michael Johnston being loaned out by the Scottish champions this season.                The exciting 19-year-old winger has been the subject of enquiries from &ldquo;a number of clubs&rdquo; according to Rodgers, although he added he was unaware of any possibility the player could join Hibs on loan as part of Celtic striking a deal for transfer target John McGinn.                                                    There is firm interest in Johnston from St Mirren manager Alan Stubbs, while the teenager himself has admitted he may have to consider a loan move in order to further his development with regular first team football.                                                    But Rodgers insists Johnston, in contention to make his European debut for Celtic tonight in the second leg of their Champions League first qualifying round tie at home to Alashkert, could yet have a significant role in his plans for the coming campaign.           &ldquo;Mikey is a big talent,&rdquo; said Rodgers. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s obviously interest from a number of clubs in getting him on loan. You are in the situation where it&rsquo;s a case of can you give his talent the game time he needs? &ldquo;With Alan Stubbs, we had a very good chat about Mikey and they&rsquo;ve got a good history at St Mirren of bringing young players through. There are other guys I&rsquo;ve spoken to as well, so we&rsquo;ll see.&ldquo;It just depends. We don&rsquo;t want him to stagnate. He might play less games here but he&rsquo;ll be learning still and that&rsquo;s important. Just being around this squad will help his development, as opposed to only getting games in his legs.&ldquo;He&rsquo;s developing well but, at this point, we are not thinking of letting him out on loan. You always have to be mindful there are a couple of injuries in our first team squad and we may need Mikey.&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t want to stop that growth and development. Some young players need to have a career outside a club to have a career in it. Others, like Kieran Tierney, can go in and play regular first team football for Celtic straight away. You are always trying to balance giving them games or letting them go out on loan.                                                                                                         &ldquo;It&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t always be a good loan, sometimes you have a bad loan as well. Some players have spells that don&rsquo;t quite work out but good or bad can work for you. It&rsquo;s about creating the right pathway for the player.&rdquo;Johnston was a star performer for the Scotland under-21 side which reached the semi-finals of the Toulon tournament this summer and he thrilled the Celtic support with his contribution and goal in the 4-1 friendly win over Standard Liege on Saturday.Rodgers is satisfied with the progress being made by a player he feels is beginning to appreciate the need to ensure his individuality can operate effectively within the collective framework of the Celtic side.  &ldquo;You saw Mikey at the weekend and tactically he&rsquo;s improving all the time,&rdquo; added Rodgers. &ldquo;He has incredible ability one versus one but you have to play with the idea tactically. He has that special ability to go past people, that speed that ​takes him away, and he&rsquo;s got confidence and a bit of  charisma on the field.                                                                                                         &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t need an injection of confidence, that&rsquo;s for sure. He&rsquo;s got a lovely arrogance when he plays. He knows he can go either way but it&rsquo;s about fitting in to the collective.&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no top team in the world that plays with freedom and players just going out and playing. You play with a structure and there&rsquo;s moments in the game when you qualities come in to it.&ldquo;He knows now that you can&rsquo;t run forward if you can&rsquo;t run back. We will see in time.  I can see a great future for him as long as he wants to learn.&rdquo;<br><br>  <br><h3>&lsquo;Frail&rsquo; Mikey Johnston hopes gym can help him muscle into Celtic side</h3><br>Andrew Smith<br>Published: 06:00 Sunday 06 January 2019<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/frail-mikey-johnston-hopes-gym-can-help-him-muscle-into-celtic-side-1-4852334<br>On the surface of it, 2019 is starting for Mikey Johnston just as did 2018. The Celtic winger yesterday headed off with the rest of Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; squad to Dubai for a winter training camp, as was the case 12 months ago. However, there the parallels end for the 19-year-old.<br><br>In the closing weeks of last year Johnston made the breakthrough that he has sought since his senior debut in May 2017. He started three of Celtic&rsquo;s final four pre-shutdown fixtures and, more significantly, netted three times in those games to open his first-team goal account. An injury crisis that left the club without a striker may have accounted for the wide player being pressed into action through the middle, but he certainly seized his moment.<br><br>Johnston showed his finishing prowess with a fine strike in a 3-0 win at home to Motherwell &ndash; which led to him tweeting that he was &ldquo;living the dream&rdquo; &ndash; only days before he netted a clinical double as the same scoreline was recorded against Dundee. The year may have ended with the bitter disappointment of derby defeat at Ibrox. However, the youngster was left with an impossible job to shine when leading the line that day, with Rangers&rsquo; swamping of Rodgers&rsquo; side resulting in him being entirely starved of service.<br><br>Despite that misery, Johnston can still reflect on having made significant progress in a season abridged by a hamstring problem that kept him out for the entirety of October. And it&rsquo;s why he will not feel that he is retreading his footsteps when he flies out to the United Arab Emirates.<br><br>&ldquo;Dubai, it&rsquo;s an opportunity, especially for younger players,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Just being away every day and training, it gives opportunities to impress. I was there last year as well and it was the same but I felt more like a young player then, I was being brought away, I was getting chances but this year I&rsquo;ve been a bit more involved and I feel like I&rsquo;m not just coming on to make appearances sometimes, I want to try and stamp a place.&rdquo;<br><br>Johnston&rsquo;s task to make good on that goal would not appear to have been made any easier by Celtic&rsquo;s loan signing of Olivier Burke from West Bromwich Albion yesterday. While the Midlands club&rsquo;s &pound;15 million buy is ostensibly a right-winger and the teenager&rsquo;s preferred position is on the opposite flank, it is one more attacker to swell the ranks of those already operating at the Scottish champions.<br><br>It is likely two more forwards will also be added &ndash; Timothy Weah is expected to join on loan from PSG and two bids have been rejected by Slovakian club Dunajska Streda for Ivorian striker Vakoun Issouf Bayo &ndash; meaning that Johnston could have his openings seriously squeezed.<br><br>Yet, the fact that a clutch of home-grown products have prospered under Rodgers despite the intensity of the competition, most notably in the shape of Kieran Tierney, James Forrest and Callum McGregor, ensures Johnston is certain there is a pathway available to him.<br><br>&ldquo;Everyone feels as if that&rsquo;s there for players if you work hard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There are always opportunities for people to come in, whether it&rsquo;s training or games. I have always been handled well. The coaches here are all good, it&rsquo;s their job isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;<br><br>Johnston&rsquo;s talents have always been rated more than good, his exceptional close control lauded often by Scotland Under-21 manager Scot Gemmill. And in a year where he endured a series of niggles and strains, his performances in Toulon would rival his late flurry at Celtic for highlights of a mixed year. Not least the brilliant individual solo goal he produced in the semi-final defeat by England, wherein he weaved half the length of the pitch evading red jerseys as if they were cones on the training pitch before slamming a pinpoint effort in from an unforgiving angle.<br><br>&ldquo;That was good,&rdquo; said Johnston, whose boyhood idols were the similarly slight and skilful Aiden McGeady and Shunsuke Nakamura. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d come back from injury, a thigh strain, I was out for nine weeks, and come back and played a few development squad games and then played in Toulon and it was good for my fitness and getting game time. Coming back for pre-season, I only had a week off, so it was good for that,&rdquo; Johnston added.<br><br>&ldquo;The whole year has been a bit up and down for me because I&rsquo;ve had a few injuries and a couple of setbacks. It&rsquo;s ended well but I have been a bit frustrated through the year, so hopefully I can have a more straightforward year this year.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had to work really hard to get back fit a couple of times from a couple of injuries, not bad ones, but it sets you back a wee bit. You might have had chances in games and  have been injured, so it&rsquo;s frustrating, but I&rsquo;ve worked hard and at the end of the year I&rsquo;ve got my opportunities.&rdquo;<br> <br><br>His promotion came with a warning from his manager that he required to bulk up to cope with the physical demands of the game &ndash; a comment that echoed Gemmill&rsquo;s assessment that he just had to wait for his body to catch up with his ability. The winger proves slightly defensive on the issue of physical development but does acknowledge that dealing with injuries has certainly assisted his growth when it comes to thinking situations through.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been smaller or more frail than everybody else, so hopefully I&rsquo;m catching up a bit now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only 19, so it will come naturally as well, but I do work hard in the gym.<br><br>&ldquo;My maturity has got better because at the start I&rsquo;d get angry at being injured because when you&rsquo;re young you can play more but when you get older, you start to pick up wee injuries and you just want to be back. It can be frustrating, but I&rsquo;ve just had to be a bit more patient.&rdquo;<br><br><div>That patience could be tested in the months ahead. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><br></div>
