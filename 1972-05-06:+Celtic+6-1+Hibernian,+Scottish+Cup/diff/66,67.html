They paid $370 for a four day trip to Scotland.</li>  <li>  Celtic were offered the chance to play Santos, Pele et al, in New York as part of their post season trip to Bermuda. However no dates could be arranged and the players went off on their Bermudan break.</li><li>On the Thursday prior to this game Celtic lost 3-1 to Hearts at Tynecastle in the Reserve League Cup Final 1st leg.

It was an entertaining game but the contest was over after Celtic&#39;s third goal when Hibs disintegrated. Celtic went for the throat in the second half and could have had more than six.   <br><br>Before the game there was disappointment when both David Hay and Harry Hood were declared unfit because of injury.<br><br>Dixie Deans was star man with a brilliant hat trick and did a famous &#39;roly poly&#39; cart wheel on the Hampden turf after his third goal. This was his first cup final he was appearing in and was only days after the tragedy of his penalty miss against Inter Milan in the European cup semi final.<br><br>Every Celtic player was on form but there were truly outstanding performances from Bobby Murdoch and Jimmy Johnstone. McNeill scored in his third Scottish cup final - a magnificent record for a centre half.<br><br>This was Jim Craig&#39;s last game and he went out on a high with his Celtic team mates giving him a send off to remember.<br><br>The attendance of 106,000 eclipsed the glamourous Wembley final between Leeds and Arsenal by 6,000.<br><br>The winning Celtic team was minus the talents of McGrain, Hay, Hood, Lennox, Davidson and Quinn which gives an example of the strength in depth Celtic had at that time. It was to be a pity that the Celts did not win the penalty shoot out as a European Cup final against a Johan Cruff inspired Ajax would have been quite a prospect and with Celtic in this kind of form they could easily have won it again as in 1967.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams;</h3><b>Celtic: </b>  <br>  <a href="/page/Williams%2C+Evan" target="_self">Williams</a>; <a href="/page/Craig%2C+Jim" target="_self">Craig</a>, <a href="/page/Brogan%2C+Jim" target="_self">Brogan</a>, <a href="/page/Murdoch%2C+Bobby" target="_self">Murdoch</a>, <a href="/page/McNeill%2C+Billy+%281958-75%29" target="_self">McNeill</a>, <a href="/page/Connelly%2C+George" target="_self">Connelly</a>,<a href="/page/Johnstone%2C+Jimmy+%27Jinky%27" target="_self"> Johnstone</a>, <a href="/page/Deans%2C+John+%22Dixie%22" target="_self">Deans</a>, <a href="/page/Macari%2C+Lou" target="_self">Macari</a>, <a href="/page/Dalglish%2C+Kenny" target="_self">Dalglish</a>, <a href="/page/Callaghan%2C+Tommy" target="_self">Callaghan</a>.

To lose by<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the biggest score ever in the history of the 98-year-old competition was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>shattering and maybe incomprehensible to them. The 6-1 final score had<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>been matched in 1888 when Renton, the world champions then, beat<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Cambuslang. <br><br>There is a link in the scores in that after that<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>final Kelly and McCallum the Renton half backs left and joined a new<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>club being formed in Glasgow&mdash; Celtic! James Kelly became captain of the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>first Celtic team. He was the father of the late Sir Robert.<br><br>The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>simple explanation of Hibs&#39; defeat is that Bobby Murdoch established<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>himself as boss of the mid-field. He ruled that area with the haughty<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>majesty of a ring master, bringing order to it and sending out his acts<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>to delight the audience.<br><br><b>WORLD CLASS</b><br><br>His was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>football of world class. Its quality was not just in interception and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>positioning and in accurate imaginative passes to inspire attacks, but<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>in the less flamboyant settling passes. He could step into trouble and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>sweep the ball back to the goalkeeper or to a distant part of the field<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>to allow the defence to get organised again. He always did the right<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>thing. In such form there would be a place for him in any team in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>world. Yet he is not in the Scotland pool of 22 players for the Home<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Internationals. <br><br>He was well supported by the running of the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>willing Tommy Callaghan but not so well by Kenny Dalglish who was out of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>touch completely and found usefulness only in filling space where Hibs<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>hoped to find it. They had banked on establishing some sort of control<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>in the mid-field.</div>  <div>  <br>Hibs had looked for so much from<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Alex Edwards but got very little. I had wondered about him before the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>match but had not expected that he could so vanish from the play that<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Pat Stanton would be shouldered with an intolerable burden. Jimmy<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>O&rsquo;Rourke had his troubles with the speedy Celts and Stanton was left<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>doing the work of three and in a position which is not his best.</div>  <div>  <br>Things<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>began to go wrong for Hibs when the rain came on Friday night and made<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the turf right. The ball sat down and that suited Jimmy Johnstone. There<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>were ominous signs for them them even before the first goal was scored<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>after 120 seconds. Johnstone beat a few men and Celtic strung together a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>few passes and clearly they were in the mood.<br><br>Johnstone gave<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Hibs&#39; defence a terrible time. His briefing was to go wherever he could<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>find space. Thus, since he played in no specific position he was hard to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>mark. Once he got jinking there was only one way to stop him and when<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Hibs&rsquo; defenders resorted to that they lost two goals from free kicks.</div>  <div>  .</div>  <div>  </div>  <div><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffAdd">   </span>The first was a bad one to lose for when Billy McNeill took up<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>position for the free kick he was loosely marked with much space in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>front of him and into that the ball was put. He was unimpeded when he<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>shot the goal. There after Gordon had to do much running going up with<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>McNeill for the set pieces in front of goal.<br><br>It was one of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>McNeill&#39;s best games. He had impressive control in the air and the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>expected heading duel between him and Alan Gordon did not materialise.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Gordon won the ball but twice yet each header of his produced a half<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>chance. Long before the end Gordon and young Hazell had been played out<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>of the game by McNeill and George Connelly and only Arthur Duncan, on<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the left, was a threat. Eventually he was injured and had to be<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>substituted. Connelly was a magnificent partner for McNeill.<br><br>The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>four Hibs backs had much to contend with in the switching imps, Lou<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Macari and Dixie Deans, and the jinking Johnstone and the probing of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Murdoch and the running of<i> </i>Callaghan but they coped commendably<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>well. Schaedler was the better full back for Brownlie, under pressure<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>lost composure. Black was safe but Blackley was more than that in skill<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>and competitiveness. <br><br>Blackley was Hibs&#39; most effective player<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>and had he been able to stick to his own job then Celtic would not have<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>found goal-scoring so easy. But when the midfield was lost he went<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>charging forward trying to get into the game. This was forced on him for<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>nobody else looked like shaking Celtic&#39;s defence.<br><br>In the later<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>stages when Hibs were trying to save face by pushing on they were at the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>mercy of the long passes of Murdoch springing Macari and Deans.<br><br>This<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dixie Deans just can&shy;not keep out of the limelight. He enjoyed the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>circumstances on Saturday for to score three goals in a Scottish Cup<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>final must be the ultimate in foot&shy;ball happiness. The second, in which<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>he beat Brownlie twice and Herriot twice, was one we longed to see in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>action replay. Twice Macari came within an inch or two of matching the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>three goals and that would have been the ultimate in wonder.<br><br>Stein<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>said yesterday. &quot;Let&#39;s take stock of the season, we won the League<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>championship and the Scottish Cup and we were in the final of the League<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Cup and were not beaten in any of the European Cup matches.

Afterwards Ann and I were with Jock Stein and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his wife; they&rsquo;d been guests at our wedding. Big Jock was blaming me<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>for one of England&rsquo;s goals and Ann wasn&rsquo;t standing for it, no matter the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>man&rsquo;s reputation. She gave Big Jock what for.&rdquo;<br><br>Ann wore Jim&rsquo;s<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>medal round her neck, the badge from Hibs&rsquo; December 1972 League Cup<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>triumph, the year&rsquo;s third Hampden final between the greens. Hibs took<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the Drybrough Cup as well but in the May, in front of a crowd of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>106,101, a Dixie Deans-inspired Celtic ran out 6-1 winners for an 18th<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Scottish Cup. Stein vs Eddie Turnbull was the classic dugout<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>confrontation of the age and Herriot, who lives in Larkhall,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Lanarkshire, played for them both.<br><br>&ldquo;Jock was a great manager and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Eddie was a great coach.

Pung (John Hazel) deputised for<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the injured Alex Cropley in the Scottish Cup final, but Sodjer was back<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>for the League Cup. And Herriot? &ldquo;At Dunfermline I was Kookie after the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>detective in 77 Sunset Strip [a hotrod-driving hipster with a heavy<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>personal grooming regime] because I was aye combing my hair like him. At<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Hibs I got another name. Alex Edwards said: &lsquo;You walk just like Robert<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Mitchum &ndash; dead suave.&rsquo; So I became Big Bob.&rdquo; Edwards is one of the old<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>team-mates who regularly checks on his well-being. &ldquo;I aye know it&rsquo;s him<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>on the phone. He&rsquo;ll go: &lsquo;Is that the world&rsquo;s worst goalie?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll tell<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>him: &lsquo;And you&rsquo;re the crankiest wee bugger there&rsquo;s ever been&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br><br>But<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>here&rsquo;s a funny thing. Instead of picking the ball out of the Hibs net<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>six times 43 years ago, Big Bob could have been Celtic&rsquo;s &rsquo;keeper,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>replacing Ronnie Simpson. &ldquo;Big Jock had saved my career at Dunfermline.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>We had five goalies and I was heading out the door but he decided to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>keep me and Eddie Connaghan. Then he tried to sign me for Celtic when I<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was at Birmingham, only they wanted a bigger fee than Stoke paid<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Leicester for Gordon Banks, and he eventually cooled on the idea. I was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>amazed when he went for Evan Williams, who at that point was in Wolves&rsquo;<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>reserves.&rdquo;<br><br>Williams smiles at his rival&rsquo;s recollection when I<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>track him down in Dumbarton. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt Jim&rsquo;s version of events.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Yes, I did wonder why Wolves had bothered buying me [from Third Lanark]<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>but when I was out on loan to Aston Villa, Sean Fallon told me not to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>sign for anyone else because Celtic would be coming.&rdquo; Was he intimidated<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>by having to fill Simpson&rsquo;s gloves? &ldquo;No, because I&rsquo;d had to follow<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Jocky Robertson at Thirds, while at Wolves all I heard was the name Bert<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Williams.&rdquo;<br><br>To show Stein what he was missing, Herriot always<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>wanted to put on a show against Celtic. &ldquo;Sometimes that was my downfall.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>I did have some good games against them but other times I tried too<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>hard and made a fool of myself.&rdquo; In May &rsquo;72, he was undone by an old<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>trick. &ldquo;Billy McNeill scored from a header from a corner. Jock knew from<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dunfermline that I liked to come for crosses so he had Bobby Lennox<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>block me off. Exactly the same thing happened when Billy scored in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>&rsquo;65 final [Celtic 3, Pars 2] and if I remember right it was that bugger<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Lennox again.&rdquo; Alan Gordon equalised but Celtic regained the lead before<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the interval. Herriot again: &ldquo;In the second half Eddie had us really<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>attack them, leaving just three at the back. We had as many chances as<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>them, possibly more, but they were so clinical. I know this might sound<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>daft, given it finished 6-1, but we were quite unlucky.&rdquo;<br><br>Williams<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>would not disagree. &ldquo;Hibs had a great team back then. Even before that<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>final, after I&rsquo;d played my first ten games for Celtic and we&rsquo;d won them<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>all, we went to Easter Road and they beat us with two Joe McBride goals.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>That brought us down to earth. I can name their entire &rsquo;72 side. [He<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>does]. Not bad, given I&rsquo;m 70 this summer. It tells you the quality they<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>had, at a time in the Scottish game when every team had some rare<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>players. I&rsquo;m not being patronising, but even at 4-1 Hibs were still in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>that final. I was pretty pleased with my saves from wee Jimmy O&rsquo;Rourke<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>and that bag of tricks Alex ?Edwards. Even at 5-1 they kept coming at<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>us.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic had a great team, too: five Lisbon Lions plus Kenny<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dalglish, Lou Macari, George Connelly, Tom Callaghan and Hibee nemesis<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Deans (18 goals in 13 games against them). &ldquo;We were lucky back then,&rdquo;<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>continues Williams. &ldquo;Well, not lucky, but we had Jinky who could beat<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the opposition on his own and Dixie who on that day couldn&rsquo;t stop<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>scoring.&rdquo; For one of his goals Deans seemed to have been fired from a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>circus cannon to connect with a wayward Johnstone shot with his head.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>His next trick was impossible but &ndash; rounding Herriot twice and dumping<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>three international defenders on their backsides &ndash; he pulled it off. The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>somersault celebration was less Olga Korbut, more Harry H. Corbett.<br><br>At<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Hibs&rsquo; post-final dinner, Turnbull took the blame for the defeat through<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his gung-ho tactics and vowed the Tornadoes would be back; they were.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>At Celtic there was no real celebration, as was customary. Williams<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>again: &ldquo;The club won so much at that time and Jock didn&rsquo;t want us<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>getting blas&eacute;. I won four league championships but never once got to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>hold the trophy and my four medals were given to me in a oner. Maybe<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>that&rsquo;s why, until recently, every one I won was kept in a Safeway bag.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Sorry to Hibs fans for that!&rdquo;<br><br>What&rsquo;s in a name? Evan Williams was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>christened Samuel. Dixie Deans is really John. The Hibs goalie in &rsquo;72<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>has been called many things, and seen &ldquo;Jim Herriot&rdquo; grow into a highly<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>successful literary brand.
