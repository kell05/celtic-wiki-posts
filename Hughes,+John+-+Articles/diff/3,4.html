I said: &lsquo;But, sir, I don&rsquo;t even like football&rsquo;. He said: &lsquo;You will by the time I&rsquo;m finished with you&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br><br>He nearly scored what might have been the winner in a European Cup final &ndash; 1970, against Feyenoord in the San Siro &ndash; and even though he has never watched a recording of the defeat and never will, he is convinced it was the reason Jock Stein ended his 11-year stint with the club, when he was 11 goals short of a double-century.<br><br>He nearly won Goal of the Season playing for Crystal Palace, but a typically slaloming run and dynamite shot against Sheffield United eventually placed him runner-up to Ronnie Radford (the one for non-league Hereford United which helped dump Newcastle United out of the FA Cup; probably it was the youthful parka-clad charge across the gluepot pitch which was the clincher there).<br><br>And he nearly shared a team-bath with blue-movie actress Fiona Richmond but by the time Palace manager Malcolm Allison contrived his publicity stunt Hughes had moved on to Sunderland for a long-cherished hook-up with his younger brother Billy, only to be crocked 15 minutes into his debut. He would never terrorise right-backs again.<br><br>He nearly came a cropper running pubs, facing up to extortion threats and Crocodile Dundee-type knives, and sometimes the only response was to laugh: &ldquo;I got held up at 11 o&rsquo;clock in the morning once when there was nothing in the till. &lsquo;Look pal,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you put the shotgun down, take off your balaclava and have a pint of heavy and we&rsquo;ll say no more about it&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br><br>Hughes was nearly on the pitch in Lisbon, nearly a member of the immortal, false teeth-sporting, uncologned, Glasgow-and-environs XI who won the European Cup in 1967. Getting injured before the final against Inter Milan haunted him for a long time and he used to say it was the worst moment of his life.<br><br>But what happened six years ago changed his perspective, made him realise that it&rsquo;s only a game.<br><br>I meet the original Yogi &ndash; well, that was Hanna-Barbera&rsquo;s cartoon bear, forever ursine about in Jellystone Park, but you know what I mean &ndash; at his semi-detached in Sandyhills, Glasgow with the personalised-plate Audi in the drive and photos of the grandweans peeking out from behind the Greek columns in the sitting room. He is 71 and looks well. There&rsquo;s a bit more beef about him than in his pomp, when there were still 14 stones, but at 6ft 2ins he can carry it. His father made breeze blocks &ndash; &ldquo;He was a big man&rdquo; &ndash; and so is Yogi, who must be glad to have the weight back after his cancer scare.<br><br>&ldquo;It started with a sore ear and then a growth was discovered on my tongue,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;When I was told it was cancerous I had a whitey.&rdquo; Another near miss; he could have died. &ldquo;My son Martin is a consultant at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and he was with me went I went there for my test results. He only told me recently that my chances of surviving had been 25 per cent.&rdquo; And at this the colossus sheds a tear.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t know that, otherwise I might not have made it. Ken McKenzie of the ear, nose &amp; throat department said it was my stoicism that pulled me through. I guess I&rsquo;ve always been stubborn, but Ken was amazing: great sense of humour and such humility. I lost my hair, my teeth and four stone in weight, with tubes stuck up my nose the whole time. Pals would say, &lsquo;My, Yogi, you&rsquo;re looking great&rsquo;, but I knew they didn&rsquo;t really think that. I got used to the baldy &ndash; my wife, Theresa, reckoned I fancied myself as Kojak &ndash; and I was determined the cancer wasn&rsquo;t going to beat me.&rdquo;<br><br>Other ailing footballers will be pleased he did. &ldquo;I was visiting my old Celtic pal John Divers in hospital the other day. He&rsquo;s got dementia. I always tell him he&rsquo;s a dirty, rotten, crabbit so-and-so. His wife Liz says it&rsquo;s the only time he laughs. The amazing thing about JD is that he played football, scored more than 100 goals for Celtic, despite suffering from bad circulation. Folk thought he was lazy; a surgeon told him when he was 20 that he had the legs of a 70-year-old. But this was kept from the club otherwise he&rsquo;d have been let go.&rdquo;<br><br>Then there&rsquo;s brother Billy, a fine player in his own right, just as lethal a striker and an FA Cup winner with Sunderland, who had the chance to follow Hughes into Parkhead but feared he would struggle to escape the comparison. &ldquo;Now Billy&rsquo;s got cancer; he&rsquo;s in a bad way. It started with his prostate and he&rsquo;s terrified it&rsquo;s going to spread to his bones. I had a long chat with him last night. His wife Linda says he listens to me. We&rsquo;re all hoping for the best, praying for it.&rdquo;<br><br>Hughes, of course, is a green-blazered member of the regularly-reconvening survivors of Scottish football&rsquo;s bright and shiningly greatest club achievement. I say &ldquo;of course&rdquo; but he hasn&rsquo;t always enjoyed Lisbon Revisited. &ldquo;I was sick to miss the final, to be there and not play. Folk say &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it great?&rsquo; but having to watch was absolutely dreadful. I was happy we won but I immediately felt detached from it and that never changed.&rdquo;<br><br>Surely the guys put an arm round his shoulder, reminded him of the part he had played and commiserated. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anyone did. They were caught up in the emotion. Football doesn&rsquo;t work like that; it&rsquo;s a selfish game. But I don&rsquo;t blame them. Maybe I was churlish, not enjoying the reunions, but I did think that only if you were a wonderful human being &ndash; and I&rsquo;m certainly not &ndash; could you turn up at these events and go: &lsquo;This is fantastic&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;I have to say, too, that at one time I might have been excluded from them. There was a move to formalise the Lisbon Lions and make money out of &rsquo;67 and some who shall remain nameless suggested it should be just the 11 who played. I thought that was nonsense. By that logic Willie Wallace would have been included having played three games in the competition and me with my five games would not. Anyway, the fans complained &ndash; they wanted to see everyone.&rdquo;<br><br>Now Yogi is laughing. &ldquo;Me and Bertie are pally now but do you know that when we played I complained to Jock about him? He wouldn&rsquo;t pass to me. He only gave me the ball when he was in trouble: &lsquo;Go on, you look stupid&rsquo;.&rdquo; The next reunion at the end of the month will see the Lions return to the Portuguese capital for the Champions League final. &ldquo;The relationship we have with each other can be difficult to explain. We were pretty close as a team but as the years have gone by the bonds have grown stronger. The reason is we&rsquo;re getting old and some of us are dying.&rdquo;<br><br>He chuckles some more because he is remembering Bertie gags. &ldquo;We were in Belfast for a supporters function, Bobby Murdoch, Tam Gemmell, Bertie and myself, and a big armoured vehicle bristling with guns went past. &lsquo;Look at that&rsquo;, we said. Bertie said: &lsquo;Aye and that&rsquo;s just the breid van&rsquo;!&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s another: &ldquo;Jinky [Jimmy Johnstone] was nearing the end and I was visiting him and Bertie appeared, looking vexed. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rsquo; we said. He said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m just back from Maryhill. They&rsquo;ve pulled down my mother&rsquo;s old shop and found a body&rsquo;. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s terrible&rsquo;, we said. &lsquo;Aye&rsquo;, said Bertie, &lsquo;the poor fella was still wearing this medal: 1922 Hide-and-Seek Champion!&rsquo;&thinsp;&rdquo;<br><br>You want local colour? Yogi has a tale to match Bertie&rsquo;s and his is true. In post-war Coatbridge, the fact the Hughes family had a car marked them down as exotic, all the more so when it trundled up to the house with a greyhound in the passenger seat. Yogi&rsquo;s dad was a bit of a gambler and had driven over to Ireland to splash &pound;800 on the mutt. It was the fastest thing on four legs, right enough, but only in solo trials. Up against other dogs it stayed quaking in the traps.<br><br>Hughes&rsquo; Parkhead career had two distinct chapters. He arrived a big lump of a boy and made enough of an impression, skittling defenders and thumping in 20-odd goals a season, to interest Juventus as a replacement for John Charles (another near miss for him). But he was disillusioned by the lack of proper coaching, fell out with assistant manager Sean Fallon, decided Celtic were &ldquo;dreadful&rdquo; and was planning to quit until Stein tipped him the wink about his impending return. Big Jock began with two big defeats &ndash; 6-2 by Falkirk and 5-1 by Dunfermline &ndash; but greatness soon followed.<br><br>Yogi won six championship medals, a Scottish Cup badge and four League Cup medals. He was most effective in mudbaths &ndash; &ldquo;I can still hear [trainer] Neily Mochan shouting; &lsquo;Run him, big yin, run him&rdquo; &ndash; but wasn&rsquo;t bad on skating rinks, once borrowing Billy McNeill&rsquo;s sandshoes to net five against Aberdeen in an 8-0 icebound romp. In the 1965 League Cup triumph over Rangers, he scored both Celtic goals from the penalty spot &ndash; a result sparking a pitch invasion, players confronted by fans, which stopped future Hampden laps of honour. In another Old Firm game he kneed Willie Johnston where it hurts, expected to be sent off but wasn&rsquo;t, a blunder which effectively ended referee Jim Callaghan&rsquo;s career. Against Hibs he broke Bobby Duncan&rsquo;s leg: &ldquo;It was accidental, I&rsquo;d never have done that deliberately, although I played with guys who would&rsquo;ve.&rdquo;<br><br>And in the Intercontinental Cup against Argentina&rsquo;s Racing Club, he was one of the four sent-off Celts. &ldquo;I kicked their goalie. The provocation was terrible. I was a sub for the second game and their fans peed on the guys on the bench. But I have to say that when I watched a video years later I was shocked by what I&rsquo;d done. Jock asked afterwards: &lsquo;What were you thinking of?&rsquo; I said: &lsquo;Boss, I honestly didn&rsquo;t think anyone would see me&rsquo;. How stupid is that?&rdquo;<br><br>So what was his relationship with Stein? A pause, broken by a wry smile. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say he treated me especially badly.&rdquo; But even though football in Hughes&rsquo; era was a hard, hard game run by fearsome disciplinarians, you wonder if he means this. For instance, while he was in Bermuda on a close-season tour, his first wife Mary lost a baby. The fact he wasn&rsquo;t back in Glasgow with her tells you this was a different age; nevertheless he only learned the sad news from a journalist. When he found out Stein knew and hadn&rsquo;t alerted him he confronted the manager to be told: &ldquo;Sort it out when you get home.&rdquo;<br><br>When that marriage ended, Yogi was devastated. He blamed selfishness and booze and so quit drinking. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I was an alcoholic, but those six years when I stopped probably helped me survive.&rdquo; He met Theresa in a Majorcan karaoke bar and laughs that he&rsquo;s glad this was before cancer robbed him of his singing voice. &ldquo;Although,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s coming back.&rdquo;<br><br>Back to Stein: he recalls a game at St Johnstone&rsquo;s old Muirton Park when he suffered a bad gash requiring stitches. The manager, though, was unconcerned and would go on to blame him for the defeat. Then there was Feyenoord. Yogi claims that compared to &rsquo;67 when Stein hoodwinked Inter on their spying missions, moving the team around and all but putting Jinky in goals, preparations for the second Euro final were nothing like as intense. &ldquo;We were complacent. We thought Leeds had been the final [Hughes scored in the semi victory]. I remember saying we were going to win three or four-nil. The manager should have knocked that nonsense out of us but he obviously thought the trophy was in the bag. Did he spy on them? He said he did but I don&rsquo;t know. And he changed the team, dropping George Connelly and leaving us short in midfield.&rdquo;<br><br>Given all that, why does Yogi hold himself responsible for the defeat? I tell him his miss wasn&rsquo;t so bad, that their goalie made himself extra-big. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what folk say. That&rsquo;s what Davie Hay said only recently. But it&rsquo;s in my head that I could have won us another European Cup and that&rsquo;s why Jock got rid of me.&rdquo; Hughes learned later that bigger English clubs including Everton wanted him, but Stein was insistent he went to Palace. &ldquo;He threatened to put me in the stand for six months if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And, Yogi adds with a chuckle, there was a sting: Stein was the TV judge who didn&rsquo;t award him Goal of the Season. &ldquo;That was what he was like.&rdquo;<br><br>And yet, and yet&hellip;Hughes says Stein was &ldquo;brilliant&rdquo; at man-management and &ldquo;great&rdquo; for his career. He might have baulked at the disciplinarian stuff but there were times when it was needed. He might have questioned the lack of coaching but the evidence on the pitch was that the team did little wrong. As with the rest of the Lisbon Lions, his relationship with his boss was complicated. And possibly beyond the comprehension of you and me, the non-immortals.<br><br>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get me wrong,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;That was a magnificent team, I was fortunate to play for them, and if I&rsquo;d been fit for Lisbon I might not even have been picked. For me it&rsquo;s a long time ago &ndash; longer in view of what&rsquo;s happened to me &ndash; and I&rsquo;m just happy I&rsquo;m still here. But I&rsquo;ll enjoy going back with the guys.&rdquo; If Auld makes good with the jokes, he may even give them a song.<br><i><br>Yogi Bare (&pound;18.99) by John Hughes with Alex Gordon is available from the Celtic Shop. </i>  <div align="center"></div><div align="center"></div><div align="center"></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>  John Hughes Lifts Lid on Run Ins </h3><h3></h3><a class="external" href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/john-hughes-lifts-lid-run-ins-3515962" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/john-hughes-lifts-lid-run-ins-3515962</font></a>   <br><br>Daily Record May 2014 <br><br>John Hughes lifts lid on run-ins with Celtic great Jock Stein and tells how boss kept his wife&#39;s miscarriage from him<br><br>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/john-hughes-lifts-lid-run-ins-3515962<br><br>JOCK STEIN is a legend to Celtic and Scotland fans.<br><br>The former boss is held in reverence at Celtic Park and his statue towers over the stadium&rsquo;s<br>main approach.<br><br>But one of Stein&rsquo;s own players, John Hughes, has launched a bitter attack on the dugout giant.<br><br>Hughes claims:<br><br>* Stein kept news of Yogi&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s miscarriage a secret from him.<br><br>* Forced him out of Celtic at the peak of his career.<br><br>* Responded to the striker&rsquo;s pay rise request by threatening to cut his wages.<br><br>Hughes yesterday opened up about the legendary gaffer as he unveiled his autobiography at their spiritual home of Celtic Park.

To mark the occasion, Celtic are flying the surviving Lions out to Lisbon and Hughes will be among those on board.<br><br>He is enthused about the prospect of meeting up with those he played alongside during a decade of stellar service in a Celtic shirt but it is tempered by a sense of disappointment and regret. Hughes has a winner&#39;s medal from that famous victory over Internazionale but doesn&#39;t feel like he earned it. An ankle injury kept him out of the final but he is still not convinced Stein would have picked him even if he had been fit.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to Lisbon although not playing in 1967 was one of the most disappointing times of my career,&quot; he said at the launch of his autobiography, Yogi Bare. &quot;It was terrible not to be involved. You&#39;re detached from it and it was terrible afterwards, during all the celebrations.<br><br>&quot;You force a smile but, deep inside, it&#39;s soul-destroying. Obviously, I didn&#39;t want to see the boys lose but I didn&#39;t feel part of it when they won. I had a poisoned ankle but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have been playing anyway because I had a bad game in the semi-final against Dukla Prague. They weren&#39;t even going to take me with them. When they did, I shared with John Cushley and, when I removed the bandage on my ankle, the poison spurted five feet into the air. So I spent most of my time in my room. But for the club to be taking me back to Lisbon is wonderful.&quot;<br><br>Hughes is a candid story-teller. After all these years he has regrets and he is not reluctant to reveal them, both in print and in person. The decision by Stein to sell him to Crystal Palace in 1971 still stings him to this day. He did not want to leave Celtic but the manager had other ideas. It is a transfer that has left a bitter taste in the mouth that has never gone away.<br><br>&quot;What he [Stein] has done for Celtic no-one can ever change that, it&#39;s in the history books,&quot; he added. &quot;It was a phenomenal achievement. But he wasn&#39;t my favourite person eventually. I didn&#39;t go to his funeral. I would have been a hypocrite if I had gone. He got rid of me when I was in my prime and three months later I was finished.<br><br>&quot;People say to me, &#39;are you bitter?&#39; Yes. In the book we&#39;ve tried not to comment. We&#39;ve told people what happened and left them to make their own minds up. Then it&#39;s not me who&#39;s saying it; it&#39;s their own opinion. Yes I was bitter. I was finished at 28. I think I&#39;m the seventh highest goalscorer [in Celtic&#39;s history] but had I stayed until I was 32 and kept scoring at the same rate I would have been third top.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m a Celtic guy and I didn&#39;t want to leave Celtic. Ken Gallacher [the journalist, later of The Herald] had told me that Everton and Sheffield Wednesday were interested in me as well. He asked why I signed for Crystal Palace when other clubs were in for me. I didn&#39;t know, he [Stein] didn&#39;t tell me. I was negotiating with the Crystal Palace chairman and the boss and he [Stein] came in and took me outside. He said: &#39;You get in there and f*****g sign or I&#39;ll sit you in the stand for nine months.&#39; So that was that. It would never happen nowadays as you&#39;ve got agents and some sort of say. With Jock you didn&#39;t have a say. You know what they say about power corrupting and absolute power. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get over what happened.&quot;<br><br>Hughes plays down talk that he and Stein had a &quot;troubled relationship&quot; but some of the anecdotes in the book do not paint the former Celtic and Scotland manager in the most flattering of lights. &quot;We were on a post-season tour to America in 1966 and my first wife, Mary, was pregnant at the time. I used to phone home every five or six days. Then I bumped into Ken Gallacher one morning and he said, &#39;sorry to hear your news&#39;. I didn&#39;t know what he was talking about and he was the one who told me that Mary had had a miscarriage four days earlier. Jock knew but he hadn&#39;t told me. Make your own mind up.&quot;<br><br>Hughes, on the mend after a recent cancer scare, has retained some good memories, too. He scored in the European Cup semi-final win over Leeds United in 1970, played in the final against Feyenoord (even though Celtic lost) and scored goals by the bucketload season after season. &quot;It was just fantastic playing in that team with so many good players,&quot; he recalled. &quot;We were entertaining. People talk about the current side having to play against packed defences but we had to deal with that every week as well, home and away, but we overcame it because we had the ability. We also had three of the highest goalscorers in Celtic&#39;s history; myself, Bobby Lennox and Stevie Chalmers - and what you need to remember is that I made most of their goals!&quot;<br><br>He had been approached in the past to do a book but never showed any desire. Now 71, he felt the time was right. &quot;I wasn&#39;t interested but then one of my sons said it would be a good idea to leave a legacy for my grandchildren. It was very enjoyable.

He is a genuine club legend; a spectacular, awesome player in his prime. John was affectionately known as &lsquo;Yogi Bear&rsquo; after the popular TV cartoon character at the time. Celtic Park would reverberate to raucous chant of &lsquo;Feed The Bear&rsquo; when Hughes was in rollicking action. He fired in 189 goals in his eleven eventful years in the Hoops and became a cult figure with the supporters. In his autobiography published in 2014 Yogi decided to lift the lid on his remarkable life and times. As you might expect, he pulls no punches!<br><br>I was seventeen years old when I came into the Celtic first team. One minute I was playing schools football and the next I was rubbing shoulders with greats such as Neilly Mochan and Bertie Peacock. I have to say I wasn&rsquo;t intimidated playing in that environment. I had all the confidence of youth and I was used to scoring goals, no matter the level. But I was raw, no doubt about it.<br><br>My game was basically very simple. The defence would fire the ball down the pitch, I would hare after it and attempt to belt it on target. Such methods would be frowned on today, but I still see teams taking route one to goal. It may not be pretty or easy on the eye, but goals win games.<br><br>Although I was getting on the scoresheet regularly, I knew I could do better. Maybe a lot of players would have been happy to claim my goal ratio with eighty-eight strikes in my first four years, but I always wanted to push myself to the limit. If I scored one, I wanted two. If I got two, I wanted three. And so on.<br><br>Back then, though, so much of what was happening at the club was just a joke. Take the training, for instance. What training? Willie Johnstone was the club physiotherapist and he was in charge of all the routines. When I say &lsquo;all the routines&rsquo; I mean running round the touchlines until you felt you had just lapped the globe. Sometimes it would be pitch black and Johnstone couldn&rsquo;t see that some of the players &ndash; notably goalkeeper Dick Beattie and centre-half John Jack &ndash; had nipped off to the back of the Jungle for a fly cigarette.<br><br>They would stand up there and watch the rest of us go round and round in circles. Then Johnstone would signal there would be just one lap to go and they would put out their fags and join the rest of us. The physio never twigged. Beattie, who played in Celtic&rsquo;s never-to-be-forgotten 7-1 League Cup Final win over Rangers in 1957, was a real character. In fact, neither<br>Beattie nor Jack even bothered to get changed out of their street clothes when they turned up for training. When Johnstone wasn&rsquo;t looking, they just pulled on their tracksuits over their everyday wear safe in the knowledge they wouldn&rsquo;t be working up a sweat. Sometimes, if we were really lucky, we would get a ball to play with. Believe me, this was a rare occurrence and normally happened on a Friday, the day before the game.<br><br>bviously, it was thought useful to re-aquaint the players with the instrument of their trade. Johnstone seemed more intent in turning Celtic Football Club into a squad of marathon runners than actual footballers. When I look back, it&rsquo;s easy to see why the club didn&rsquo;t figure too often in winning silverware. We might have been fit enough, with the exception of Messrs Beattie, Jack and the rest of the skiving smokers, to run from here to Timbuktu, but just don&rsquo;t ask us to do too much with that precious spherical object called a ball.

I have to say the playing surface was treacherous that afternoon. It was flint-hard and there was a silvery glow under the floodlights. We didn&rsquo;t possess such a luxury of undersoil heating in those unenlightened times.<br><br>There was a further problem with fog beginning to settle on the east end of Glasgow. Celtic were top of the league and Big Jock was determined to get the game played to increase our lead over our main rivals. He was confident of a victory and it was so important to show who were the new masters of Scottish football. It was preposterous to accept the club had last lifted the championship in season 1953/54. During that grim period Rangers won the flag on six occasions. We knew our time was coming, but even the most optimistic among those at Celtic would never have believed we would be victorious in 1966 and win it on another eight successive occasions.<br><br>Jock, as was his normal pre-match routine, walked onto the pitch with referee Tom Wharton, a massive match official who, at 6ft 4in was actually two inches taller than me. So, naturally, he was known as Tiny. At this stage, possibly about half-an-hour before the kick-off, the game must have been in doubt. The Celtic manager was nothing if not persuasive. He must have got to work on the ref. I can almost hear him say, &lsquo;Och, there&rsquo;s nothing to worry about, it&rsquo;ll clear in minutes.&rsquo; Anyway, Tiny agreed and he declared the game on.<br><br>However, Jock must have wondered if his compelling and forceful argument to play the fixture might just have backfired on him. Rangers left-winger Davie Wilson was a tricky, little customer. It was often said he could win the Ibrox men a penalty-kick when he was fouled on the halfway line. Listen, Wee Davie could get our old foes a spot-kick at Aberdeen when he stubbed his toe getting on the team coach at Ibrox! A bit far-fetched, but you get the drift.<br><br>Having said that, he was a superb goalscorer for the club, especially for a player normally operating in a wide position. He demonstrated that against us inside ninety seconds of that particular confrontation. He mastered the tricky conditions better than our defenders, collected a rebound and slammed a low left-foot drive away from Ronnie Simpson. The man known to us all as &lsquo;Faither&rsquo; was blamless as the ball squeezed in at the far post. It was a blow, no argument, but I doubt if there was a single team-mate on the park that day who didn&rsquo;t believe we could turn it around. Although it must be admitted it&rsquo;s never clever to give Rangers a goal of a start.<br><br>We began to turn the screw and pummelled their defence for just about the entire remainder of the first-half. They were defending frantically and I must admit I wasn&rsquo;t getting too much joy out of my immediate opponent Kai Johansen. I was pushing the ball past him and chasing after it, but he was doing a very reasonable job of getting back to put in tackles. It was frustrating, to say the least.<br><br>As ever, Big Jock had something to say in the seclusion of our dressing room at the interval. Like the rest of us, he was not happy. &lsquo;This is more important than a Cup Final,&rsquo; he observed. &lsquo;This is the league championship. Win this and they&rsquo;ll never catch us. Get out there and get the job done.&rsquo;<br><br>We had forty-five minutes to change things around. I spotted a pair of discarded white training shoes lying in the corner. They had suction pads and were used for training indoors. I think they were Billy McNeill&rsquo;s gear, I&rsquo;m not sure. I had been wearing rubber studs in the first-half and they were as useful as a chocolate fireguard. I decided to give them a try and, thankfully, they fitted.<br><br>The game was merely four minutes into the second-half when I combined with Tommy Gemmell and our left-back sent a dangerous low cross skidding into the Rangers penalty area. Joe McBride dummied the ball and that was just perfect for someone of the speed and courage of Stevie Chalmers. He darted into the danger area and turned the ball past Billy Ritchie. Game on!<br><br>I was beginning to get into my stride on the left wing. The shoes were doing their job and definitely helped me maintain my poise and balance when I was running with the ball. Suddenly I was leaving Johansen in my slipstream. My pace was beginning to tell and he was mistiming his tackles. Thirteen minutes after the equaliser, we were ahead. It was Stevie again with a header from a left-wing corner-kick. Rangers were on the ropes and we knew it. So, too, did they. Time to go for the jugular and finish them off.<br><br>Seven minutes later, I got away from Johansen again and saw Charlie Gallagher taking up a great position about twenty-five yards out. Charlie struck a beautiful ball, that was undoubtedly his forte. He wasn&rsquo;t a tackler and Big Jock always insisted we had to let our opponents know we were on the field. &lsquo;Win the battle and you&rsquo;ll win the war,&rsquo; he would say often enough. Charlie had other strengths, though. He was a lovely passer of the ball to unlock the meanest of defences, but he could hit the ball like a cannonball, too. I beat another couple of defenders before looking up to make sure Charlie was still unmarked and slipped the ball as expertly as I could in front of him. Charlie simply lashed an unstoppable drive in the direction of Ritchie&rsquo;s goal. The ball exploded against the underside of the crossbar before bouncing down over the line. The Rangers keeper didn&rsquo;t move a muscle.<br><br>The fourth goal in the 79th minute from Bobby Murdoch was a collector&rsquo;s item. Not because of the awesome power and flawless accuracy from our midfielder because he displayed both qualities often enough in his exceptional career. No, it&rsquo;s the role referee Tiny Wharton played in it. Jimmy Johnstone and Gallagher combined on the right before Charlie sent the ball across the Rangers defence about twenty-five yards out. The pass was actually heading for Tiny when he suddenly opened his legs and let the ball go through them. It was a consummate dummy any pro footballer would have been proud to claim.<br><br>Bobby read it perfectly and hit a devastating left-foot drive that almost took the net away. I have watched a video rerun of that game and I was hugely impressed by Ritchie. He was left lying on the turf, beaten for the fourth time, the game lost and, staggeringly, he got to his knees and applauded Murdoch. That didn&rsquo;t often happen in the heat of an Old Firm duel, but it did display the keeper&rsquo;s unbelievable sportsmanship.<br><br>It was all over for the Ibrox side when I moved the ball over from the left, Wee Jinky got involved and the ball dropped perfectly for Stevie to launch a low drive past Ritchie. It was the end of a perfect day played in hellish conditions. The fog continued to descend and about an hour after the game, you could hardly see a hand in front of your face. The Rangers contingent in the 65,000 crowd must have hoped it had fallen earlier in the afternoon.<br><br><br>- See more at: http://www.cqnmagazine.com/?p=5785#sthash.2n9RWPE1.dpuf  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">BIG YOGI: THE UNLUCKIEST LION</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">http://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/big-yogi-the-unluckiest-lion/</span><br><span class="diffAdd">By CQN Magazine on 25th May 2017 LIONS &amp; LEGENDS</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">JOHN HUGHES earned the tag of the &ldquo;Unluckiest Lion&rdquo; when he was forced to watch history being made by his Celtic team-mates in Lisbon.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The versatile forward who combined battering-ram qualities with the deftest of touches will never forget the day he realised he wouldn&rsquo;t get the opportunity to be given the nod from Jock Stein.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Hughes recalled: &ldquo;Two simple little sentences, 22 words in all, hit me like a wrecking ball.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;&lsquo;I am sorry, Yogi, there&rsquo;s no way you can play.

I&rsquo;m not going to lie about that.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was so desperate to be involved, to be out on that lush pitch at the Nacional Stadium and to be playing my part as my team Celtic became the first British club to be acclaimed as the best in Europe.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;How would it have felt to have been on the pitch when the referee blew his whistle for time-up in Lisbon with the scoreline reading: Celtic 2, Inter Milan 1? It goes beyond description.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Hughes, who scored 189 goals in his Hoops career, added: &ldquo;On the flight to Lisbon I could feel the ankle begin to swell. Fitz was right and there was clearly a reaction to the pressurised atmosphere inside the aircraft.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">GW544H485</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;By the time we reached our hotel in Estoril I was wondering if I could remove my footwear. I was rooming with reserve centre-half John Cushley and he helped me ease my foot out of the shoe.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I took off my sock and, at that very moment, liquid spurted out of my ankle. Unfortunately, the injury had become poisonous and the four hours or so on the plane brought everything to a climax.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Cush managed to find some tissue paper to stem the flow. We called in Fitz and he took a look at my ankle. He didn&rsquo;t waste too much time in summing up the situation. &lsquo;Complete rest throughout the summer,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t even think about kicking a ball.&rsquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;My season was finished. But a new era for Celtic was just beginning. It would be fair to say I had mixed emotions.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;If only I had been fit enough for selection in Lisbon. Fate, though, decreed otherwise.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">*Extract from YOGI BARE, John Hughes&rsquo; biography, signed copies are available on CQNBookstore.com  </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></div>
