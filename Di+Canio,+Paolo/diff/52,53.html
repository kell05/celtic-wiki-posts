The signing was typical of Burns, a man never afraid to look further afield to uncover exciting attacking talent. <br><br>When Di Canio arrived at Celtic he joined a cosmopolitan squad that already boasted the considerable talents of Dutch striker <a href="/page/Van+Hooijdonk%2C+Pierre" target="_self">Pierre Van Hoijdonk</a>, German international <a href="/page/Thom%2C+Andreas" target="_self">Andreas Thom</a> and Portugal&rsquo;s <a href="/page/Cadete%2C+Jorge" target="_self">Jorge Cadette</a>. Together with Pierre &amp; Jorge, the three were mockingly labelled as the &#39;<a href="/page/Three+Amigos" target="_self">Three Amigos</a>&#39; by chairman Fergus McCann.<br><br>The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>arrival of the gifted but highly temperamental Italian not only<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>provided Celtic with an abundance of riches in attack but sent out a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>clear signal of how Burns wanted his rebuilt Celtic to play. The fans<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>were licking their lips in anticipation.<br><br>In some ways they were<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>not to be disappointed. Celtic were sensational at times that season and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>in pure football terms could look streets ahead of any of their<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>domestic rivals. But while their attacking forays were often a joy to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>watch the team was all too frequently undone by a defence too prone to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>making elementary and costly mistakes.<br><br>For his part Di Canio was a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>sensation. An outrageously gifted player, the skilful Italian rapidly<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>became the darling of the fans. His flair was coupled with a real<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>cutting edge which meant that more often than not his audacious ability<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>not only entertained but produced that vital end product.<br><br>As is<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>so often the case with players of Di Canio&rsquo;s talent there was a real<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>arrogance to his play and demeanour. That arrogance could make for great<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>viewing as he teased the opposition but it didn&rsquo;t always warm him to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his team mates. <br><br>In one of his early training sessions at Celtic<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Di Canio stormed off the practice ground vowing never to return. The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>catalyst of this tantrum was the ability of his own team-mates &ndash; or<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>rather lack of ability. After one stray pass too many Di Canio had<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>enough. He stormed off the pitch and let Burns know in no uncertain<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>terms that he thought the calibre of player he was asked to work with<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was beneath him. He may have had a point but it was still uncalled for.<br><br>There<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>can be few players who have ever been as animated on the football field<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>as Di Canio but these regular displays of emotion only endeared him<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>further to a support desperate for a hero to finally bring an end the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>dominance of an all conquering Rangers just one championship away from<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>equalling Celtic&rsquo;s record of nine titles in a row.<br><br>But even with<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Di Canio &ndash; either up front or out wide - Celtic far too often slipped up<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>when it came to the crunch. The First Team lost all four league<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>encounters with Rangers, and although the Italian scored a penalty in a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>2-0 <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup" target="_self">Scottish Cup</a><span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>quarter-final win over the Ibrox club the Hoops crashed out of the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>tournament after a replayed semi-final, embarrassingly losing out 1-0 to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>First Division <a href="/page/Falkirk" target="_self">Falkirk</a>.<br><br>For<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>all his talent and fight when it came to these crucial encounters it<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>has to be said that Di Canio did not produce when it mattered most.<br><br>That<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Falkirk match signalled the end of Burns as Celtic manager and was the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>beginning of the end of Di Canio as a Bhoy. The Italian &ndash; who prior to<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Milan had played for Terrana, Lazio and Juventus &ndash; came to Glasgow with a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>reputation as a hot head.<br><br>It was a reputation he lived up to and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his discipline on the pitch was poor, too often finding himself in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>confrontation with opponents and referees. He was labelled &lsquo;fiery&rsquo; by<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the tabloids and there could be little argument with such a description.<br><br>Despite<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the tags, Di Canio enjoyed a good relationship with Burns but when the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>manager was sacked he saw an opportunity to engineer his own departure<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>from the club. Paolo was vocal in his disappointment in the axing of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Burns and when the following pre-season came around he remained in Rome<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>rather than return to Glasgow. He stated that a &quot;<i>little problem</i>&quot;<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>had emerged regarding his contract with the club. On the one hand, he<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>says that the club promised to revise his contract upwards if he had a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>good first season whilst the chairman says there was no such agreement.<br><br>A<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>cat and mouse game thus ensued between the club and the player with<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>accusation and counter-accusation flying to and thro. Celtic vowed that<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Di Canio had signed a contract and would not be sold.<br><br>Just days<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>after stating Di Canio was not for sale the player &ndash; in the infamous<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>words of Celtic&rsquo;s then Director of Football Jock Brown &ndash; was &quot;traded&quot; in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>a &pound;4.5 million deal with Premiership side Sheffield Wednesday which saw<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Dutch winger <a href="/page/Blinker%2C+Regi" target="_self">Regi Blinker</a><span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>coming to Parkhead. A very poor trade as it was to prove in time. Jock<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Brown even tried to use it as vindication of his ability in his position<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>but all it did was make us laugh and/or cringe.<br><br><img align="right" alt="Paolo Di Canio - Kerrydale Street" height="293" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/bTY6MAG5_mm4a6NR4iLSlQ133559/GW153H293" title="Paolo Di Canio - Kerrydale Street" width="153">Di<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Canio&rsquo;s acrimonious departure from Celtic undoubtedly split the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>support. Many were furious that the club did not do more to keep such a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>uniquely gifted player. Chairman and majority shareholder <a href="/page/Fergus+McCann" target="_self">Fergus McCann</a><span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>took the bulk of the flak.

Consequently his<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>only honour was a Goal of the Season award while with the Hammers.<br><br>He<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>returned to Italy and Lazio &ndash; his beloved boyhood team &ndash; in 2004 at the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>age of 36. Now home in Rome another ugly side to his nature was to rear<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>its head. <br><br>While in England, Di Canio revealed in his<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>autobiography that like many Lazio fans he had far-right wing views and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>admitted his admiration for wartime Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Now at Lazio, Di Canio saw fit to express these political feelings by<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>giving a Nazi salute to the Rome club&rsquo;s notorious right-wing supporters<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>on a number of occasions, sparking outrage around the football world. He<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>claimed that he&#39;s a fascist but not a racist! In many ways showed that<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>he just followed and jumped on any cause, and his politics were simply<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>very crude and populist, although in this case he&#39;d fallen for a very<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>nasty strand.<br><br>These antics and the player&rsquo;s subsequent defence of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his actions have made Di Canio a bit of a darling of the neo-fascist<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>movement in his home land. Had his political leanings been known during<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>his time in Glasgow it is likely his relationship with the Celtic<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>support would have deteriorated rather rapidly, and he would have been a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>person non grata and punted. If his views were clear before he even<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>signed, Celtic would have steered well clear of him.<br><br>These<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>despicable shows of support of fascism have further isolated Di Canio<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>from a Celtic support which for a very short time worshipped him. Now he<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>is a figure loathed almost universally by the Celtic fans. In total Di<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Canio scored 15 goals in 38 appearances for Celtic. He will always be<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>remembered as a wonderfully gifted (albeit greedy) footballer but alas<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>also as a rather pathetic person with diabolical political sympathies.<br><br>In<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>2014, he tried to put his name forward for the Celtic managerial role,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>but thankfully he was never in the running or even considered. It was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>just another PR stunt by Di Canio for attention to keep his name in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>papers. In recent seasons, he had been very controversially hired as<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>manager of Sunderland &amp; Swindon, both were very poor spells and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>there was a serious backlash from many on his appointment in those<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>roles. <br><br>In 2016, he was removed from Sky Sports Italia after<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>showing off a fascist tattoo of Mussolini that he had covering his back.<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>It was quite despicable, and pathetic.

Born in 1968, Di Canio<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>grew up in a country that was violent and divided, as it had been since<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Mussolini&#39;s rise to power. The 1945 liberation had failed to stimulate<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the national unity that fascism had claimed it would build and a vicious<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>settling of scores left around 15,000 Italians dead in the three months<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>that followed. There were no trials, no coming to terms with the past<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>and, consequently, no definitive end to the ideological conflict in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Italian society.<br><br>After students revolted in 1968, northern<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>factory workers joined the fray in the &quot;hot autumn&quot; of 1969, car<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>industry operatives pitched battles with the forces of order on the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>streets of Turin. Tacitly supported by the police, secret services and<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>more openly by conservative society, rightwing violence erupted in<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>response. The 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan left 16 dead and more<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>than 80 wounded. Hastily blamed on anarchists, it was eventually traced<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>to a neo-fascist group based in the Veneto region.<br><br>The<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>politicisation of the piazzas transferred to the terraces and, in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>midst of these tensions, Lazio won its first league title in 1974. Di<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Canio was six, an age at which many of us imprint our first football<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>memories, and the team was full of &quot;Paolinos&quot;: mavericks, or fascists,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>with passions for parachuting, militarism, violence and the neo-fascist<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Italian Social Movement (MSI).<br>Guardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you<br>Read more<br><br>Hated<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>across the country for its political leanings, that Lazio team also<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>loved firearms. Holding up a Roman jewellery shop as a prank in 1977,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the midfielder Luciano Re Cecconi was shot dead. Rightwing and leftwing<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>terrorists were financing their political activities with armed<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>robberies, and Rome was understandably edgy.<br><br>Growing up in the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>working-class district of Quarticciolo, Di Canio&#39;s allegiance would<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>logically have been to AS Roma. Instead, he chose to fight as the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>underdog and, even as a member of Lazio&#39;s youth team he continued to run<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>with the Irriducibili ultras. For them, beyond the team itself,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>loyalty, community and a romanticised glorification of the past are the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>ties that bind. As an almost textbook fascist community, that past is<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>very much Roman.<br><br>The Roman past appealed to Mussolini too, who<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>assumed the title of Duce: the Latin word DUX, which translates as<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>&quot;leader&quot;, is tattooed on Di Canio&#39;s bicep. The Roman salute became a<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>part of daily life. Made compulsory prior to all sporting events, it was<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>this snarling gesture, during the Rome derby, that dogs Di Canio. &quot;An<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>ancient historical practice&quot; and &quot;different to the Nazi salute&quot; it might<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>be, but these are issues that he would have done well to explain ahead<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>of his first match as a Premier League manager on Sunday. He brought<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>them to the table after all.<br><br>But there is more to this than<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>simply football and Sunderland&#39;s risky survival strategy. There is the<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>fact that here in Italy there is a growing tide of support for many of<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>the ideas and thoughts that Di Canio espouses.<br><br>Mussolini<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>initially opposed ideas of Nordic racial purity, insisting that culture<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was the main determining factor in race. But his scientists eventually<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>&quot;discovered&quot; that Italians were, in fact, Aryans of part-Nordic descent<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>which led in 1938 to racist policies officially being adopted. As such,<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>Italy&#39;s splintered neo-fascist parties do not always conform to British<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>concepts of neo-Nazism, such as the BNP, which seems to be what Di Canio<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>was driving at in previous explanations.<br><br>One such neo-fascist<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>group that has grown considerably in Rome since its formation in 2003 is<span class="diffRemove"> </span><span class="diffAdd">  </span>CasaPound.
