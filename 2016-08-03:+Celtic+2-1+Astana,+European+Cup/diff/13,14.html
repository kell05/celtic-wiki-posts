Has been regressing since first season, needs replaced  if not this window, definitely in next two<br>Janko - Good showing imo,  done his defensive work and tried to push on but a severe lack of  support after Roberts went off. Great pace<br>O&#39;Connell - Played very  well, won a good amount of headers, dealt well with 1-on-1&#39;s, often  shaped to hoof then took ball under control, passed well too. Known lack  of pace wasn&#39;t exposed due to good positioning &amp; communication.<br>Lustig - Pretty calm, if uneventful game, some nice accurate long balls.<br>Tierney - Great tackling/harrassing, calm under pressure, good in final 3rd, won a penalty<br>Brown  - Better than usual, got stuck in without leaving foot in (important  with that ref), some decent passing and ball control. <br>McGregor - Worked hard enough, but only seems to play in spurts<br>Armstrong - Garbage. Poor passing, tackling, awareness and set pieces.<br>Roberts - Pretty good until injury<br>Forrest  - Mixed bag, decent pace, trickery and play in opposition half.  Effectiveness diminished upon changes in team after Roberts went off<br>Griffiths  - Little general link-up play but some good exchanges around box,  always looking to get onto left foot, missed best chance of game<br><br>Johansen - Erratic, little cohesion with teammates despite some decent forward passes<br>Toure - Looked quick enough, assured and probed for passes<br>Dembele  - Didn&#39;t get much of the ball, challenged well for scraps, great run  with ball into box for Penalty, calmly slotted a nerve-shredding penalty  deep into injury time<br><br>(Arsene P of KDS)<br>Was pretty much like last season against teams that defend deep with the usual suspects showing why they&#39;re not quite up to it. We really struggle to link up midfield and attack and until we get better personnel we lack in key areas we&#39;ll struggle against packed defences.<br><br>The result was all that mattered though and overall we shaded it.<br>Astana have decent players, and opened up a bit in the second have caused us problems as we &quot;went for it&quot;. Their offside goal should have been a warning, and after they did score we had a real shaky spell.<br><br>Hopefully we can improve to get past the play-off round and if we do that we might sign &quot;better, first team starter&quot; players who won&#39;t be attracted unless there&#39;s the CL to play in.<br><br>No point in slagging individual mistakes, but I reckon for their goal it was one of those unfortunate things. KT was left for dead and if Gordon hadn&#39;t come, chances are there would have been a goal (attempt), and yes, his header could have gone further but he cleared the danger. Brown missed blocking or stopping the scorer, who finished brilliantly. If the decent chances had been converted before that, we would have been in easy street, but we didn&#39;t and it caused the crowd to get tense, with a lot of rancour amongst the non-season book folks beside me.<br><br>Demb&eacute;l&eacute;&#39;s Celtic career could have been over before it had started had he missed, but he didn&#39;t, so let&#39;s hope he can settle down and become a first pick.

side.<br>Leading 1-0 through a Leigh Griffiths penalty at the end of the first half, the Scottish champions were rocked by a stunning equaliser from Astana substitute Agim Ibraimi which left the contest heading for extra-time.<br>But just as stoppage time began, Celtic earned a second spot-kick when Dembele was sent sprawling. The young French striker, signed from Fulham this summer, took responsibility and showed outstanding grace under pressure to convert from 12 yards.<br>The Kazakhstan champions, aggrieved by the two penalty awards, finished the night with nine men as Igor ****** and Dmitri Shomko were sent off in the closing moments.<br>But it was joy unconfined for Rodgers and his players who are guaranteed group stage football in Europe this season. They will hope to make that in the Champions League where they now go into tomorrow&rsquo;s play-off round draw.<br>Nerves and anxiety are occupational hazards for the Celtic players at this stage of the competition. Before Griffiths showed composure and confidence to net the opener from the spot in the dying embers of the first half, there was a sense of trepidation in the stadium.<br>Although Astana had to cancel out Celtic&rsquo;s away goal at some stage to have any prospect of winning the tie, they were content to play a waiting game in a bid to frustrate the home players and supporters.<br>Celtic controlled possession from the start but found it difficult to move the ball quickly enough into advanced positions as they faced the blanket defence of the visitors.<br>Rodgers opted for a 4-1-4-1 formation which provided scope for wide men Patrick Roberts and James Forrest to push forward in support of central striker Griffiths and make it an adventurous 4-3-3.<br>But there was little in the way of ammunition for Griffiths whose selection ahead of Dembele, who dropped to the bench, underlined the favourable early impression he has made on his new manager.<br>There was a first sniff of goal for last season&rsquo;s 40-goal hitman in the seventh minute but he was unable to find a clean connection. Griffiths looked more threatening when he sprinted on to a long ball into the box seven minutes later, only to be crowded out by defender Yuri Logvinenko.<br>Astana were happy to break up play by any means necessary in order to prevent Celtic finding any rhythm or momentum and they collected their first yellow card of the evening when ****** was cautioned for persistent fouling as early as the 21st minute.<br>Scott Brown almost put  Celtic ahead in spectacular fashion a minute later, the captain getting on the end of a pre-planned corner from Stuart Armstrong and firing a scissors kick a foot over the bar.<br>Griffiths came close with a flashing left-foot shot wide of Nenad Eric&rsquo;s left-hand post after sharp build-up work from Armstrong and Callum McGregor down the left.<br>Astana were slipshod in possession when they had the chance to counter attack but Craig Gordon was called into action for the first time when he cut out a dangerous low cross from Patrick Twumasi.<br>There was a setback for Celtic just after the half-hour when Roberts limped off with an injury which had restricted his impact on the game. The on-loan Manchester City winger was replaced by Stefan Johansen.<br>As Celtic tried to increase the tempo late in the first half, they forced Eric into his first significant save when he did well to clutch Armstrong&rsquo;s low shot.<br>Logvinenko then made a brilliant block to deny Griffiths on the edge of the six-yard box before Celtic&rsquo;s persistence was rewarded with Astana&rsquo;s needless concession of a penalty.<br>Aizal Beysebekov, trying to usher Kieran Tierney towards the corner flag, clumsily chopped down the Celtic left-back right on the edge of the box. Shomko and Junior Kabananga were both booked for protesting but Griffiths, who last season vowed to stay off penalty duties after several misses, kept a cool head to send Eric the wrong way.<br>Celtic looked to build on that at the start of the second half and Griffiths should have done better than skew a shot wide from 10 yards after being played in by Johansen. The striker was then denied by a brilliant recovery tackle by ****** just as he was ready to pull the trigger on a superb through ball from Brown.<br>Astana had always needed an away goal and they gradually gained a greater share of possession. The warning signs were there for Celtic when Azat Nurgaliyev looped a header beyond Gordon before his celebrations were halted by an offside flag.<br>Rodgers sent Kolo Toure on for his debut just after the hour but, before the veteran defender could settle, Astana levelled the tie with Ibraimi&rsquo;s 62nd-minute goal. It was a brilliant finish by the Astana substitute but a calamity for the defence. Tierney tried to usher a through ball back to Gordon but the keeper raced out to headit away and Ibraimi guided it back over the stranded keeper and in from 35 yards. <br>Kabananga came close to what would surely have been a decisive second away goal when he shot just wide in the 73rd minute, before the introduction of Dembele for Forrest. The Frenchman was fouled by ****** as he surged into the area in stoppage time, earning the Astana defender a second yellow card. Dembele then sent Eric the wrong way and Celtic Park into raptures before Shomko also earned a second caution for dissent.<br>  <br><br>Read more at: http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/celtic-2-1-astana-moussa-dembele-hits-late-penalty-winner-1-4193542<br>  Commentary<br><br><br>The referee ends the second half.<br>Share on<br>Despotović (in) -

and possibly penalties - seemed to beckon until Dembele won the penalty that he then converted for his first goal for the club.<br><br>That sent a raucous stadium into absolute raptures, while Astana of Kazakhstan were left stunned.<br><br>They finished with just nine men on the pitch, Igor ****** sent-off for his costly foul on Dembele and Dmitri Shomko also walking for a crazed protest at the awarding of the penalty.<br><br>Celtic now go into Friday&#39;s draw for the final play-off round - leaving them just two games away from the Champions League group stage. Even if they lose that tie, they are guaranteed a place in the group stage of the Europa League.<br>Who could Celtic face?<br>Dinamo Zagreb (Croatia), Ludogorets Razgrad (Bulgaria), Copenhagen (Denmark), Hapoel Be&#39;er Sheva (Israel), Dundalk (Republic of Ireland).<br><br>There was no early evidence that this was going to become so tumultuous. Celtic swarmed all over Astana from the start, hustling and harrying the visitors and denying them the space and opportunities they enjoyed in the first leg last week.<br><br>There really was only one team in it, Celtic dominating possession and territory. They lost Patrick Roberts to injury after just half an hour, but their control continued, albeit without many chances being created.<br><br>There was late drama in the first half, though. Kieran Tierney was taken down in the box by Abzal Beysebekov and Griffiths swept in his penalty.<br><br>Having given Celtic the equaliser in Astana, Griffiths had now put his team 2-1 ahead on aggregate - and early in the second half he could have put the tie almost beyond doubt.<br><br>From a Stefan Johansen pass, Griffiths could only find the Astana side-netting. Soon after, a raking ball from Scott Brown put Griffiths through again. As he was about to shoot, he was snuffed out by a terrific tackle by ******.<br>Kieran Tierney<br>Celtic defender Kieran Tierney could not stop Agim Abraimi&#39;s long-range shot from going in<br><br>Astana stirred at that point. They had the ball in the Celtic net when Roger Canas headed home after Gordon was caught in no-man&#39;s land, but it was chalked off for offside.<br><br>It was reminder that the tie was far from dead. Brendan Rodgers brought on defender Kolo Toure for his debut to shore things up with half an hour remaining. Toure had barely drawn breath as a Celtic player when Astana scored.<br><br>They were caught out through the middle by a long ball; Gordon forced to gallop out of his box to avert the danger with a clearing header. Instead, the ball was gathered by Ibraimi, who promptly struck the most sumptuous 40-yard shot over the stranded Celtic goalkeeper and into his net.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t the first time Ibraimi had sickened Celtic. He was a major force in the Maribor team that dumped them out of the Champions League under Ronny Deila and now he was threatening to repeat the torment.<br><br>Level at 2-2 on aggregate, Celtic Park gulped hard - and then roared thunderously - when Dembele&#39;s gorgeous trickery ended with him being upended in the box.<br><br>The new striker, just turned 20, stood over the penalty and then smashed it home, cool as you like amid the cauldron.  <h3>Parody: CELTS IN 3 GOAL EURO TIGHTROPE</h3><br>By &#39;BILL LECKIE&#39; (parody account, not real...)<br><br>By God, it  was close. I bet not many Celts fans had A-STANA under their official  New Balance shorts after this game which only raised HAIRS.<br><br>It took two debatable penalties to put Brendan and his potato stew-crew through to the play-off round and by God hell mend them.<br><br>If  this is what the Parkhead faithful are going to have to endure this  season then count me out. And yes there was a huge crowd inside Celtic  Park and loads of scarves worn and lots of songs sung. Hell, there was  even a new-fangled STANDING section.<br><br>The only thing standing by  half-time were the two sides of Mark Warburton&#39;s grin as the home side  struggled like a man struggling to get home after a particularly brutal  struggle with potatoes.<br><br>Time after time Astana launched attacks  on the Celtic goal and only a combination of luck and poor finishing  prevented the away side from running up the type of score you only used  to see on Coisty&#39;s head-board.<br><br>Of course it&#39;s a funny game and  just before half-time Tierney did a Tom Daley in the box - did you see  what I did there? - and Celtic were awarded a PENALTY.<br><br>Leigh  Griffiths scored it and immediately raised his hand in triumph. You only  hoped UEFA were watching after his behaviour last week.<br><br>Second  45 saw Astana batter the hoops harder than Coisty holding a racquet over  Sue Barker and duly the equaliser came stronger than Coisty watching  Patsy Kensit snogging Sue Barker. With a TENNIS RACQUET.<br><br>A Craig Gordon headed clearance, a piece of superb control and goal by Ibraimi. And it was game on.<br><br>But alas the hoops conned the ref once more and Moussa Dembele slammed the penalty home when I hoped it was easier to miss.<br><br>Still,  there is always September and the first old firm game of the season,  which I won&#39;t be watching as I support St Mirren 100%.<br></div>
