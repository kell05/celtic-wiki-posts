Carefully picking it up with a latex-covered hand, he smiled with satisfaction. Was this the murder weapon? Proof of what some in CID knew? Lawrence had been bludgeoned to death and set on fire by a younger brother jealous of his football talent? No, no, and most emphatically no.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> That snapshot moment in an ordinary family home in Larbert, Stirlingshire, could have resulted in Dennis Haggart, then aged 12, being framed for murder. If some CID officers had got their way, this grieving child&#39;s life would have plunged into an unimaginable abyss from which there would be no way out, and serial paedophile Brian Beattie would cheat justice. Thank God it did not come to that.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Following Beattie&#39;s eventual conviction, Assistant Chief Constable James Mackay was ordered to investigate the CID&#39;s conduct. For seven years, only privileged eyes within the highest echelons of the police were allowed sight of Mackay&#39;s subsequent report. Even Lawrence&#39;s family - distraught, persecuted, smeared and betrayed were refused access to it. To falsely accuse an innocent child of murdering his own brother without a shred of evidence was an outrage. To then refuse to come clean only aggravated that outrage.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I had long been intrigued about what might be in the suppressed report. Then, in 2005, came a possible breakthrough with the advent of the Freedom of Information Act (FoI), which journalists were told would change everything. It was one of the best things Tony Blair ever did. Public sector pen-pushers who treat information about wheelie bins as if they were guarding the nuclear firing codes would be forced, by law, to divulge it when asked. As the years passed, FoI became blunted as the wheelie-bin guardians found clever new ways to twist the law and stymie applicants. In the early days, however, it worked. More often than not, you asked for stuff and you got it</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> I decided to seek a copy of the Haggart report, so approached Lawrence&#39;s dad Larry and submitted an application on his behalf. When it arrived, it made my blood run cold. Lawrence was murdered overnight on 16 March 1996. The report revealed that his house had been searched a total of nine times when the hammer was discovered on 22 March. Officers who searched the kitchen on 18 March were adamant the hammer had not been there. Within hours of the murder, the police questioned but released Brian Beattie without even checking his alibi. My story in the Sunday Mail began by explaining that Mackay&#39;s report &#39;claimed detectives faked diaries and planted evidence in a bid to frame a 12-year-old for the murder of his older brother&#39; and that some officers&#39; conduct was allegedly criminal.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> The Haggart case should be taught at Police Scotland&#39;s training centre at Tulliallan to every rookie police officer in Scotland. If it deterred just one young detective who thinks bending facts to fit a favoured hunch is an acceptable part of the game, it would be worthwhile. Interestingly, and inexplicably, not a single newspaper or broadcaster followed up the damning contents of the Mackay report. The police force responsible was Central Scotland, a small entity whose size was seemingly detrimental to its effectiveness, especially in relation to large, high-profile cases.</span></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tbody><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tr><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3>  <h3>  SOCCER STARLET IN FIGHT FOR LIFE<img align="right" alt="The Murder of Lawrence Haggart, 1996 - The Celtic Wiki" height="315" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/10428ad18425d80eb56b0c022277ad36/GW315H315" title="The Murder of Lawrence Haggart, 1996 - The Celtic Wiki" width="315"></h3><b><font color="#333333" size="2"><br>Sunday Mail 17/03/1996</font></b><br><font color="#333333" size="2"><br>One of Scotland&#39;s brightest young footballing prospects was fighting for his life last night after a horrific attack. </font><br><font color="#333333" size="2">The Celtic youth player was rushed to hospital in Edinburgh after being viciously attacked in his own home. </font><br><font color="#333333" size="2">And his injuries are so severe, Parkhead club personnel admit they are praying the lad lives.

No murder weapon was found. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Since his death 18 months ago, at his home in Larbert, Stirlingshire, the family has had to endure the finger of suspicion pointed at the other two sons, who were in the house at the time. It now hopes the man, who is on remand for an unconnected offence, will hold the key to Lawrence&#39;s death. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The teenager&#39;s father, Larry, said the past 18 months had been a nightmare for the family - especially his other two sons -who have been regularly interviewed by police. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;It was a disgrace the way our sons were treated. This development is in some ways a relief, knowing the person responsible for Lawrence&#39;s death was still at large has meant my family could not grieve properly.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence died in March last year after returning home from a night out with friends. His brothers John, 18 and Denis, 13, were asleep upstairs at the time of the attack. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">John later found his injured brother lying on the living-room floor, his feet badly burned where they had fallen on to a gas fire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The lack of a forced entry and murder weapon left Central Scotland police baffled, and the two boys were repeatedly questioned in an attempt to find further evidence, until the man emerged as a suspect last month. It is believed the man made incriminating comments to a fellow inmate while in prison on remand. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He has already served a jail sentence for indecently assaulting young boys, and is awaiting trial on further offences. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After his comments about Lawrence, police began a search of the countryside where Lawrence was last seen as he made his way home on the night of the attack. Dozens of officers were drafted in to rake grasslands on the outskirts of nearby Denny. Officers used forks to turn over the grassy moorland along the boundary of the town. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">On the night of the attack, Lawrence had attended an under-18s disco at Ziggy&#39;s Nightclub in Denny. He and a friend later got a taxi outside the Lion and Dragon pub in Church Walk. The friend got out at Bonnybridge and Lawrence was dropped off at the lay-by outside the police station in Main Street, Camelon, near Falkirk, at around 10:30pm. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Police were called to Lawrence&#39;s house at 1:30am.

He had been due to sign professionally with Celtic in December last year. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The club&#39;s former manager, Tommy Burns, and his assistant, Billy Stark, visited him in hospital before he died. The entire Celtic squad turned out for his funeral. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart, 36, who split from wife, Janet, three years before the death, has vowed not to rest until he knows the truth. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">His sons now live with their mother in Cowdenbeath, but Mr Haggart said he was in frequent contact with them. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said: &quot;Lawrence was destined for great things, and I&#39;ll never get over what happened to him.

He is also accused of setting fire to furniture. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He has lodged two special defences, one of alibi and the other of incrimination, naming Dennis Haggart, who is now 14. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The court heard the three Haggart boys were at home while their mother was at a party. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis had come in about 10:30pm and Mr Haggart, now 19, of Braeview, Stenhousemuir, had had a go at him for &quot;taking the mickey&quot; by staying out so late. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart said he was slightly frightened of Dennis, a big boy who, although several years younger, would probably win any physical confrontation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Edgar Prais, QC, for Beattie, put it to Mr Haggart that he had been so annoyed with Dennis for coming in late he had forgotten to be a bit afraid. Mr Haggart agreed that was probably the case. &quot;He told me to f*** off,&quot; he said. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence had taken his older brother&#39;s side and had received the same message from Dennis. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart went up to his bedroom and Dennis was in his room along the landing. Lawrence remained downstairs for a while but then came up to the room he shared with Dennis. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;After a few seconds I heard Dennis telling him to f*** off and Lawrence left the room.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart said he had been dozing while watching television from his bed but thought he remembered Dennis going downstairs. He heard Lawrence say: &quot;You are supposed to be in your bed.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Later, around 1:30am, Mr Haggart woke and saw smoke in his room. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He went downstairs and found Lawrence on the living room floor. A fire had been started and his feet were lying in the flames. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He threw a basin of water on the fire and roused Dennis before calling the emergency services. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart admitted he had lied when police interviewed him. &quot;I knew where they were heading,&quot; he said. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart agreed he had been trying to protect his brother and had considered the possibility that Dennis was responsible for Lawrence&#39;s death. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart said he had told the police nothing untoward had happened, which was untrue. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He agreed with Mr Prais that he had had a &quot;hellish&quot; two weeks, struggling with his conscience before changing his account. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart accepted that, even then, he had left some things out of his statement. It was another six days before he told the police that on discovering the fire and going to alert Dennis, his brother had wakened immediately, which was unusual. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais put it to the witness that there was still more. Had he not given a further statement, almost two months after the incident, in which he said he thought he had heard someone on the landing, possibly going into his brothers&#39; bedroom, just as he wakened and discovered the fire? Mr Haggart agreed that he had told that to police but said it was untrue. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais went on: &quot;Although you have come clean to an extent, going the whole way and saying you heard someone on the landing is something you cannot say today, even though it is true. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;It is very difficult for you, today, to accept you were honest at that time, is that not so?&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart replied: &quot;No. I never heard anybody on the landing. I honestly do not know what wakened me.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Concluding his evidence with questions from the advocate-depute, Duncan Menzies, QC, Mr Haggart agreed it was because the police had Dennis in their sights that he considered whether his brother might have committed the murder. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;Did you ever really think Dennis did do it?&quot; asked Mr Menzies. &quot;Not really,&quot; said Mr Haggart. &quot;If it was just a fight or something, you could understand, but what actually happened to Lawrence a no way.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.</font></font> <br><div align="center" class="MsoNormal">  </div><br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Boy, 14, denies he killed his brother</b></font>   <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Scotsman 22/04/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>JOHN ROBERTSON Law Correspondent</b></font> <br><font size="2">A SCHOOLBOY denied yesterday that he had been jealous of his football star brother and murdered him in a fit of rage. </font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis Haggart, 14, who is being blamed for the killing by the man on trial at the High Court in Edinburgh, said he had been proud, not envious, of Lawrence Haggart&#39;s success in football. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He denied &quot;losing the place&quot; and bludgeoning his brother but agreed that in the weeks after the attack, the police had thought he was the killer. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The boys&#39; mother said she did not think it possible that one of her sons could have murdered the other. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Brian Beattie, 33, a prisoner, is accused of murdering 15-year-old Lawrence, a Scottish schoolboys internationalist and a Celtic signing, on 15 or 16 March, 1996, at his home in Glenbervie Drive, Larbert, Stirlingshire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">It is alleged Beattie repeatedly struck the youth on the head and body and set fire to his body, causing injuries from which he later died. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie has lodged two special defences, of alibi and incrimination, naming Dennis Haggart, who was 12 at the time. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis, of Braeview, Stenhousemuir, told the jury that he and Lawrence had shared a bedroom and got on well. Dennis was also keen on football and recently had reached the final trials for the Scottish schoolboys&#39; team which Lawrence played for only days before his death. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">On 15 March, 1996, their mother had been at a party and Dennis arrived home about 10:30pm. His brother John, now 19, shouted at him for being so late and told him to go upstairs to bed. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;I swore at him , told him to f*** off. Lawrence said, &#39;You just better go to bed.&#39; I said, &#39;You never go when you are told&#39;.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Later, Dennis said, he was in bed listening to the radio when someone came into the room and took the duvet off Lawrence&#39;s bed. He imagined it had been Lawrence but all he had seen was a hand dragging the cover out the room. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He remembered being wakened by John who said something had happened to Lawrence. He went downstairs and saw smoke coming from the living room. He saw Lawrence lying unconscious on the floor with an injury to his head. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis said he had given several statements to the police and was aware that, at one point, they had thought he might have murdered Lawrence. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The advocate-depute, Duncan Menzies, QC, asked: &quot;Did you, in fact, murder Lawrence?&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis replied: &quot;No.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The schoolboy agreed with Edgar Prais, QC, for Beattie, that a few weeks before his death, Lawrence had thrown a dart at Dennis and it pierced the skin of his leg. He denied burning Lawrence&#39;s &quot;footballing legs&quot; to pay him back. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis said his brother, John, had been wrong to say in evidence that he, Dennis, had told Lawrence to &quot;f*** off&quot; in their bedroom. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais: &quot;You do not want the jury to think you were angry with Lawrence because that might put you in the frame for killing him. Is that not why you are telling lies?&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The witness answered: &quot;No.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais referred him to statements he had made to the police. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In those, Dennis had said that Lawrence came into the room, switched on the light, took the cover and put off the light. Lawrence had told him to remember to turn off the radio before he went to sleep. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Asked why he had given the jury &quot;this story about just seeing a hand&quot;, Dennis said: &quot;I forgot.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais added: &quot;It is a terrible thing to have to admit killing your brother a maybe that is something you have also forgotten?&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis denied the suggestion, and that Lawrence had been sleeping downstairs because of a deep disagreement between them. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis disputed that he had lost the place and that the reason he had not gone into the living room after being wakened was because he knew what to expect. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;You had killed him, you knew how bad it was, you knew what you had done to him,&quot; Mr Prais claimed. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;You were not the same kind of star at football and that was why you burned his legs, because you were jealous and angry.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis replied: &quot;No.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">His mother, Janet Haggart, 38, choked back tears as she told of returning from a birthday party to find Lawrence lying injured on the floor. &quot;He was making a moaning noise. I was screaming. He just kept groaning.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Menzies asked: &quot;You have known Dennis since he was born , do you consider that it was possible for him to have killed his brother?&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mrs Haggart replied: &quot;No.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The trial continues.</font></font> <br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Young <font color="#000000">Celtic</font> football player &#39;was beaten to death&#39;</b></font> <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Scotsman 24/04/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>CHRIS MACKAY</b></font> <br><font size="2">A YOUNG </font><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Celtic player died from severe head injuries after being beaten, a murder trial heard yesterday. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence Haggart, 15, a Scotland schoolboy international, also suffered severe burns to his legs and to the soles of his feet, the High Court in Edinburgh was told. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Professor Anthony Busuttil, the pathologist who carried out a post-mortem examination on Lawrence&#39;s body, said that the boy had died despite a battle to save his life by a team of surgeons, doctors and nurses. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Prof Busuttil, the regius professor of pathology at Edinburgh University, told the court that the cause of death was &quot;blunt force trauma to the head&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said that Lawrence had died at noon on 17 March, 1996, in Edinburgh&#39;s Western General Hospital.

He met one man with whom he had oral sex and they were together for 15 minutes before they went their separate ways without exchanging names or saying where they came from. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Beattie told police he was back at his caravan by 2am. He was asked if he had been anywhere near Lawrence Haggart&#39;s home and replied: &quot;I&#39;m positive I wasn&#39;t in that area last night at all.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">At that stage the inquiry was into an assault on the 15-year-old, who had played for Scotland schoolboys just before his death on March 17. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The court heard that on March 18 a team of police search experts were called into the Haggart family home and during a three-and-a-half hour investigation found a triangular piece of concrete slab on grass outside the house. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">However, scenes of crime pictures taken two days earlier showed no sign of a piece of concrete. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">PC Jeffrey Adams told the court that he had been part of the search team and had spent 26 minutes searching the kitchen on March 18. No hammer had been found and in his opinion they would have found a hammer had it been there. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Detective Sergeant Robert Beveridge said he had called at the house four days later and come across the hammer in the kitchen. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He could not recall who had instructed him to go to the house or what he was told to look for, but thought there might have been a problem with the electricity. The house had been sealed and the inquiry team had taken possession of it. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He explained that he had &quot;stumbled across&quot; the hammer which was lying down the kitchen table. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He told Mr Edgar Prais QC, defending, that he was &quot;absolutely positive&quot; the hammer, with a hair attached to it, was there when he went into the kitchen. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">On Friday, the court heard forensic evidence that a piece of concrete slab could have caused the injuries from which Lawrence Haggart died. His death was the result of blunt force trauma to the head, which caused a massive skull fracture and brain damage. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The injuries were similar to those suffered by a road accident victim who had gone through the windscreen of a car. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The trial continues.</font></font><br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Murder trial is delayed</b></font> <font size="2"><b>Daily Record 29/04/1998</b></font><br></h2><font size="2">The trial of a man accused of murdering </font><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Celtic starlet Lawrence Haggart was delayed yesterday by legal debate. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Brian Beattie, 33, denies killing Lawrence, 15, at the boy&#39;s home in Larbert, Stirlingshire.

A couple of days later, he was attacked in the living room of his home in Glenbervie Drive, Larbert, Stirlingshire, as he watched late-night television. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie, 33, denies murdering Lawrence and setting fire to his body. He pleads alibi and has named Dennis Haggart, 14, Lawrence&#39;s brother who was 12 at the time, in a special defence of incrimination. The teenager has denied the claim. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Detective Sergeant Gordon Munro, 41, said that in August last year, during a renewed investigation into Lawrence&#39;s murder, Beattie was interviewed over a weekend. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">At the first batch of interviews, he said, Beattie denied any knowledge of the crime. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">However, later, said Mr Munro, there was &quot;a definite change in atmosphere , you could sense it in the room&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had been crying &quot;like a child in an adult&#39;s body.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He had spoken of having urges and being disgusted with himself. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">At a subsequent interview, Beattie claimed it had been an accident and he began to sob uncontrollably. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had said he needed help and should be in hospital. The interview was brought to an end, but during later questioning, he agreed to tell the police what had happened in the house. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Munro said Beattie described a party being held across the street and a taxi arriving to collect or drop off a fare. He had gone in the front door of the Haggart house and, through the glass-paned living room door, saw Lawrence on a couch covered with a blanket or a quilt. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;I opened the living room door and stepped in. He got up and said something . I hit him a I can remember his face, I will never forget it,&quot; Beattie had said. &quot;He fell back on the couch and I hit him again. I keep remembering the fear in his face. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;I do not know how many times I hit him or what I hit him with. It&#39;s a blank. I know I never took nothing in with me but my hands were not sore after it so I must have used something. The next thing I remember is running back down the street.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">At the time of the murder, Beattie was staying in a residential caravan at the Evergreen trailer park in Denny, Stirlingshire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He allegedly said in the statement he had gone back to the caravan and had managed to fall asleep. He got up early the next morning and burned his clothes at a lay-by. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Munro said Beattie continued: &quot;I have heard that the boy&#39;s brothers were getting the blame for it. I felt guilty because I knew they never done it. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;You will maybe find it hard to believe, but I wanted to go and say to the brothers and to his mum and dad that I was sorry for it. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;I also wanted to go to the grave to say sorry to him as if he would hear me. I wanted to tell his mum and dad who done it so they would know he was at peace now. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had added: &quot;It was just after Dunblane and I do not know if it was that that triggered something in me. We [Beattie and some of his family] went up there and took flowers.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had said he did not recall starting a fire. He wanted to be hypnotised as that might help him remember. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Munro told the jury Beattie had refused to sign the statement and had also refused to be interviewed on tape. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Some of the earlier interviews had been taped at the insistence of the detectives as Beattie had made allegations of evidence being planted against him, added the witness. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The trial continues.</font></font> <br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Detective denies beating murder suspect</b></font> <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Herald 02/05/1998</b></font><br><font size="2">A DETECTIVE has denied that a man accused of murdering a </font><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Celtic schoolboy signing was beaten up in police custody, and maintained that he made a genuine confession to the killing. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Detective Sergeant Gordon Munro was questioned at the High Court in Edinburgh over whether he or his colleagues had laid hands on murder suspect Brian Beattie in August last year. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The policeman told Mr Edgar Prais QC, defending Mr Beattie: &quot;Quite certainly not.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The defence counsel asked: &quot;Wasn&#39;t he slapped on the head and punched in the stomach?&quot; The detective replied: &quot;That is complete nonsense.

The teenager died from his injuries in Edinburgh&#39;s Western General Hospital on March 17. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Beattie has also denied attempting to set fire to furniture at the boy&#39;s home in Larbert. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He has lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Lawrence&#39;s younger brother, Dennis, who was then aged 12, for the murder. He has also lodged a further defence of alibi. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The court earlier heard from Mr Munro that Mr Beattie refused to be recorded during a final interview in August last year, but indicated he wished to make a statement. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He is alleged to have described how he went into the Haggart home and saw Lawrence lying on a couch and that the boy got up and said something. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Beattie is alleged to have stated: &quot;I hit him on the head, but I honestly can&#39;t remember what with.

I don&#39;t know how many times I hit him or what I hit him with.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The court heard that Mr Beattie denied making the alleged confession when he later appeared before a sheriff at Falkirk for a judicial examination. He told the sheriff: &quot;I didn&#39;t make any of these confessions at all.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais said to Mr Munro that that was the truth of the matter, but the detective said: &quot;It is completely untrue.

But when they met, Mr Beattie told his brother he had not committed the murder. Mr Holden said Mr Beattie&#39;s alleged confession to the murder was not tape-recorded. But a police officer had noted the statement of confession. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Holden said he had been asked to review the evidence of the unsolved murder in November 1996. He said Mr Beattie &quot;confessed&quot; to the murder of Lawrence Haggart in August 1997 but was not charged with murder until three months later. Mr Holden said that was a decision taken by the procurator-fiscal. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Edgar Prais QC, defence counsel, asked Mr Holden if, as &quot;the new broom&quot; appointed to take over the fresh investigation, he was determined to solve the murder at any cost. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Holden replied: &quot;I have nothing to prove.

And you chose foul.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Holden denied the allegation. He said that he had reviewed all the evidence and denied that police officers assaulted Mr Beattie before the &quot;confession&quot; was made. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said he had not threatened Mr Beattie that if he did not confess his family would be left unprotected while in fear of having their home firebombed because of local outrage. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Beattie, unemployed, of Ewing Drive, Falkirk, denies murdering Lawrence Haggart by repeatedly striking him on the head and body with a weapon and setting fire to his body so that he died at Edinburgh&#39;s Western General Hospital on March 17, 1996. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The alleged offence was said to have taken place at the Haggart family home at Glenbervie Drive, Larbert, Stirlingshire, on March 15 or 16, 1996, after Mr Beattie was said to have entered the house uninvited. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Beattie further denies he culpably and recklessly attempted to set fire to furniture in the home. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In a special defence of incrimination, Mr Beattie blamed Dennis Haggart, now 14, for the murder of his brother, Lawrence. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In court, Dennis denied the </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">allegation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The trial continues.</font></font> <br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Haggart case told of porn videos</b></font>   <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Herald 08/05/1998</b></font> <br><font size="2">VIDEOS featuring the abduction and torture of youths for sexual pleasure were found by police during a search of the home of a man accused of murdering </font><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Celtic youth star Lawrence Haggart, a court heard yesterday. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Detective Constable Forrest Sloan, 39, told the High Court in Edinburgh the pornographic material was in a chest of drawers at the home of Brian Beattie, 33, in Ewing Drive, Falkirk. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Sloan said he was part of a team investigating the death of Lawrence, 15, who was found dying in his home in Larbert on March 15-16, 1996. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Sloan said the search of Mr Beattie&#39;s home was carried out on August 23, 1997, when two pornographic videos were found in a front bedroom.

When the tape was switched off, police recorded a handwritten confession. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said his client was sobbing hysterically and uncontrollably because he was accused of a murder he had not committed. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Prais said: &quot;Police had tried to fit-up the alleged confession with details from the medical evidence within their knowledge. Forensic tests were carried out in Scotland and by the FBI Bureau in Washington on behalf of the defence. In all tests, Mr Beattie was eliminated from any connection with the murder scene. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Earlier, Mr Duncan Menzies, QC, prosecuting, said that if police had made up the murder confessions they were worthy of being members of the Royal Shakespeare Company or winners of the Booker Prize. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He suggested the reason why Mr Beattie had broken down during police questioning was that he was &quot;haunted&quot; by his guilt. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The jury will retire to consider their verdict today, after Lord Dawson completes his charge.</font></font> <br><div align="center" class="MsoNormal">  </div><br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Inquiry into handling of <font color="#000000">Celtic</font> murder case</b></font>   <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Scotsman 14/05/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>JOHN SMITH and JOHN ROBERTSON</b></font> <br><font size="2">AN INDEPENDENT inquiry was ordered last night into the way in which a police force investigated the murder of a </font><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Celtic youth player, whose killer was jailed for life yesterday. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Central Scotland Police announced the investigation at the end of the trial of Brian Beattie, who was found guilty of murdering 14-year-old Lawrence Haggart. The trial judge described Beattie&#39;s attack on the boy as brutal and ferocious. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence was bludgeoned and mutilated at his home in March 1996. Officers investigating the assault initially believed the teenager&#39;s younger brother was the killer, and that his elder brother might have also been involved. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had been questioned by police within hours of the attack on Lawrence, a rising member of Celtic Boys&#39; Club and one of Scotland&#39;s brightest footballing prospects. Beattie told them he had been in Edinburgh looking for sex with other men and it was another 18 months before he was interviewed extensively. He initially stuck to his denial, but eventually confessed. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Yesterday&#39;s verdict was greeted with cheers from the public benches at the High Court in Edinburgh. Beattie, 33, was told that he would serve a minimum of 15 years. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The dead teenager&#39;s father, Larry, said he was delighted at the conviction, but angry that it had taken more than two years to bring him to justice. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart, 37, accused Central Scotland Police of a &quot;balls up&quot; in the initial investigation, when officers regarded Lawrence&#39;s brother, Dennis, who was 12, as the main suspect. &quot;How anybody could believe that a boy of that age could do that to his brother a they must be sick in the head,&quot; he said. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Central&#39;s chief constable, William Wilson, said yesterday that the independent inquiry will be carried out by James Mackay, the assistant chief constable of Tayside Police. &quot;If there are lessons to be learned as a result of this review, then we will take them on board,&quot; Mr Wilson said. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Police interviewed Lawrence&#39;s brothers on a number of occasions. Once, Dennis was held for six hours and interviewed on tape. A report was sent to the Crown Office saying there was circumstantial evidence to link him, and perhaps his elder brother John, to the attack. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart said that he had been told at one point by Det Sgt Alan Stewart at Falkirk that he had evidence that Dennis committed the crime. &quot;Stewart even told me to go home and get Dennis to own up to it. Twice he asked me ,&quot; said Mr Haggart. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had denied bludgeoning Lawrence on the head and setting fire to his body in the boy&#39;s home in Larbert, Stirlingshire. He claimed detectives had fabricated confessions. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence, a Celtic signing who two days earlier had won a Scottish schoolboys&#39; cap, was lying on a couch in the living room when Beattie struck after entering the house through an unlocked door. Lawrence&#39;s two brothers, John, now 19, and Dennis, 14, were in their bedrooms upstairs. Their mother, separated from her husband, was at a party. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie has a long criminal record, including sexual attacks on youths in their homes and the abduction of a teenager. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After the jury returned a majority guilty verdict on the charge of murdering Lawrence, the trial judge, Lord Dawson, told Beattie: &quot;This was a most brutal and ferocious attack.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Police had found a pornographic video, depicting the abduction of young men by other men for sexual pleasure, in Beattie&#39;s home at Ewing Drive, Falkirk. The judge said that he regarded possession of the film, Redemption, the Abduction Series, Part Three, as extremely sinister in light of the accused&#39;s record. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Imposing the mandatory life sentence for murder, Lord Dawson said: &quot;In view of the circumstances surrounding this vicious crime, I regard you as an extreme danger to the public and I recommend that a period of 15 years should elapse before you are considered for release on licence.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Speaking outside court, Lawrence&#39;s father praised Det Supt Joe Holden and his team for the way they had undertaken a renewed investigation about a year after the murder. However, he condemned the initial inquiry which had been led by the then head of Central Scotland CID, Det Chief Insp James Winning, who is currently on extended sick leave &quot;The first investigation tried to blame Dennis and I think it is a bloody disgrace that Beattie picked up on that and blamed Dennis during the trial.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Asked where he thought the first investigation had gone wrong, Mr Haggart said: &quot;They did not check Beattie&#39;s alibi for starters, is that not enough?&quot;</font></font> <br><div align="center" class="MsoNormal">  </div>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Family&#39;s long fight for truth</b></font>   <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Scotsman 14/05/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>JOHN SMITH and DAVID MONTGOMERY</b></font> <br><font size="2">WHEN Lawrence Haggart arrived home from a disco on </font><font size="2">15 March, 1996, he had every reason to be happy. </font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The popular youngster had made his footballing debut for Scotland schoolboys in a match against Belgium two days before. Later that year Lawrence, 15, was to have signed professional player forms for Celtic. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">But within hours of arriving home on that Friday night, Lawrence had fallen victim to a murderous attack which cast suspicion on his brothers and led to bitter accusations of a bungled police investigation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">On saying goodbye to his friends outside his house, Lawrence had gone in to find his brother, John, 17, watching television. They were soon joined by their youngest brother, Dennis, well after the time he had been told to be home. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The boys stayed with their mother, Janet - their parents had separated - and that night she was at a relative&#39;s party near the family&#39;s home in Glenbervie Drive, Larbert. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">John, as the eldest, had been left in charge and he rebuked Dennis, 12, before sending him upstairs to his bedroom. Lawrence sided with John and told his young brother to do as he was told. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The two younger boys shared a room and later, when Lawrence went up, Dennis was heard telling him to &quot;f*** off&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence returned to the living room to sleep on the couch. Dennis later went down to the kitchen for some sweets and crisps and was promptly reminded by Lawrence: &quot;You are supposed to be in your bed&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">At about 1:30am, John woke and saw smoke in his room. He went downstairs and found Lawrence on the living room floor, his legs lying in the flames of a fire. A pile of his clothes had been set alight. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence was suffering from catastrophic head injuries and his shoulder had been bizarrely mutilated. He was taken to Falkirk Royal Infirmary then transferred to the Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, where he died on the Sunday. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The death, four days after the Dunblane massacre, sent shockwaves through Larbert. Fellow pupils at St Mungo&#39;s High School, Falkirk, where Lawrence was a popular pupil, were devastated. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Within hours of the attack, detectives questioned Brian Beattie because the case matched his previous behaviour so exactly. They listened to his alibi - that at the time he had been in Edinburgh and picked up a man for sex. Then they let him go. It was to take a change of police staff before Beattie was again to become the central suspect. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The initial inquiry team, led by Det Supt Jim Winning, head of Central Scotland CID, did not return to Beattie to question him further over the teenager&#39;s murder. Instead, even before Law-rence&#39;s parents decided to allow their son&#39;s life support system to be switched off, detectives began to suspect Dennis. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In the months to come they continued with their theory that it was Dennis who had bludgeoned his brother to death. Permission was given to detain him under the terms of the Criminal Justice Act and he was interviewed on tape. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">A report, based on circumstantial evidence, was sent to the Crown Office suggesting that Dennis was the culprit and that John could have played a part. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Dennis seemed to become the prime suspect for his brother&#39;s murder when no trace of a break-in was found. John and Dennis were interviewed repeatedly in the weeks after the killing and John told the jury he had been less than frank with the police to try to protect Dennis. &quot;I knew where they were heading,&quot; he said. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">But after initially claiming that nothing untoward had happened between the brothers that night, John revealed the clashes between Lawrence and Dennis. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Later, during the trial, Dennis denied he had been jealous of Lawrence&#39;s footballing success and had killed him in a fit of rage after their row that night. It was only towards the end of 1996, when Supt Joe Holden replaced Mr Winning as head of CID, that a review of the Haggart case was ordered. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">At about the first anniversary of the murder, Supt Holden and his number two on the inquiry decided there were three poss-ibilities. One was that someone in the household had carried out the attack, another that the culprit was Beattie, or a third line of inquiry - that someone else still at large had been capable of carrying out such a bizarre crime. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Supt Holden went to see the Haggarts and told them of his three theories. It was to be the first of regular weekly meetings with the couple and their sons. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart, a painter and decorator, recalled that the detective&#39;s attitude had been &quot;completely different&quot; from that which they had encountered from the previous investigating team. &quot;Here, at last, was someone who cared about my family and was determined to find out who killed my boy.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The father, who is intent on suing Central Scotland police, claimed that detectives involved in the first investigation had not kept an open mind. Claiming that Central Scotland police had made a &quot;terrible botch-up&quot; in the first investigation, he said that he had drawn up a list of complaints and sent them to the procurator-fiscal. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Further evidence showing the police in a dim light centred on photographs taken at the house soon after the attack which showed nothing on the front lawn. However, when a search team returned two days later, with a remit to look for anything that might have been used to bludgeon Lawrence, a piece of concrete slab was found on the grass. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Four days later, a detective, who said he had been sent to collect clothing for the family or to check in case a power card was needed for the electricity, found a hammer &quot;down the side of the kitchen table&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">For Supt Holden and his inquiry team, the likelihood that Lawrence had been killed by one or other of his brothers began to appear increasingly unlikely as they stepped up their investigation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;We had nothing in black and white that we could hang our hat on in regard to Dennis being involved, or John,&quot; Supt Holden said. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;We just had a gut feeling that the circumstances of the crime, the mutilation of Lawrence&#39;s shoulder, the motive that we felt was either sadistic or sexual, could not be laid at the feet of Dennis, who was 12 at the time, or John. No brother could have done what was done to Lawrence, then tortured him before going upstairs to his bedroom to sleep.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Separate attempts were made by the attacker to set fire to the couch in the living room and the carpet. Lawrence was found with his feet badly burned amid some of his clothing which had been set alight. His feet were also hard up against the lit gas fire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">By this time, with the help of the National Crime Facility think-tank at Bramshill Police College, no criminal, apart from Beattie, was identified as fitting the pattern of the crime. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The net then began to tighten round Beattie. His house in Larbert was put under surveillance by detectives and his movements were monitored. The fresh inquiry team knew that, in the absence of witnesses to say they had seen Beattie near the Haggart family home, forensic evidence could be crucial. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">But both the scorched couch and the badly burned carpet had been disposed of soon after the murder, with the agreement of the police. They had been gone over inch by inch, but had not been subjected to any detailed forensic examination. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Supt Holden&#39;s team was left with a series of photographs and a hair found in Lawrence Haggart&#39;s underpants suspected of belonging to Beattie. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Forensic tests in Scotland and at the FBI laboratory in Washington showed it came from the victim. Despite this, police attention continued to be focused firmly on Beattie. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">A warrant was issued for his arrest on a charge of fire-raising in Stenhousemuir in February last year and on Friday, 22 August, he was arrested. He was then interviewed a number of times over the weekend - not about the fire-raising, but over the death of Lawrence. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Both Supt Holden and his depute, Det Sgt Gordon Munro, were to deny a defence claim they had made up the murder confession obtained from Beattie that weekend, or that they had assaulted him. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie told police that after he disturbed Lawrence, the youngster had got up and said something to him. He then hit him on the head but could not recall what he weapon was. &quot;When I hit him the first time he fell back on the couch and I hit him again. I keep remembering the fear in his face. I do not remember how many times I hit him.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">But though they had their confession, the police had no explanation from Beattie which would have solved the most bizarre element of an unusual case. The dying boy&#39;s palms each bore the number 110 written in ink, and photographs showed the same number gouged in his shoulder, apparently using a mortice key. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Whether what was in the killer&#39;s mind when he gouged Lawrence&#39;s skin ever emerges, Supt Holden is in no doubt about one thing: &quot;He is a psychopath who gets his kicks preying on young men and boys in the safety of their own homes.&quot;</font></font> <br><div align="center" class="MsoNormal">  </div>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Footballer&#39;s killer jailed. ;Judge recommends murderer of rising star serve at least 15 years for &#39;ferocious crime&#39;</b></font>   <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Herald 14/05/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>Bruce McKain, Law Correspondent and Ian Smith</b></font><br><br><font size="2">THE killer of young </font><font color="#000000"><font size="2">Celtic football star Lawrence Haggart was jailed for life yesterday with a recommendation he serves at least 15 years for his &quot;brutal and ferocious&quot; crime. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Cheers erupted from the public benches at the High Court in Edinburgh as a jury returned a majority guilty verdict against 33-year-old Brian Beattie, described by trial judge Lord Dawson as an extremely dangerous man with a formidable criminal record. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Central Scotland Police announced last night it was to hold an independent inquiry into the conduct of its officers during the first year of the investigation into Lawrence&#39;s murder. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The move followed severe criticism by the dead boy&#39;s father, following yesterday&#39;s verdict, of the police handling of the initial stages of the investigation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Although Beattie was interviewed by police within hours of the attack on the 15-year-old footballer, who had just won a Scotland schoolboy cap, he was not charged until about 20 months later. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In the meantime, suspicion fell on the victim&#39;s 12-year-old brother, Dennis, who was also blamed for the murder by Beattie in a special defence of incrimination. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Passing sentence yesterday, Lord Dawson&#39;s words echoed those of Advocate-depute Paul Cullen (later to become Solicitor General for Scotland), when Beattie appeared at the High Court in Edinburgh in January 1992, on a charge of abducting a 16-year-old boy from his bedroom. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Cullen told the court: &quot;It does indicate that Mr Beattie represents a serious danger to the public.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lord Dawson told Beattie: &quot;This was a most brutal and ferocious attack, completely unprovoked, upon a young 15-year-old boy in his own home. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;Having inflicted horrific and patently lethal injuries upon him, you then set fire to him by setting alight the clothing upon which his inert body lay in the living room of his own home in which his two brothers lay asleep and unawares upstairs. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;You have a very serious criminal record indeed. In 1984, you were sentenced to seven years for breaking into premises and for arson. You have been convicted twice in this court. On the latter occasion, you were sentenced to five years for crimes which included assault and abduction.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In that case, the 16-year-old victim woke at 3am to find Beattie, who had been released from jail four days earlier, standing over his bed. He covered the boy&#39;s face with a blanket and, after warning him that he had a knife, tied his wrists with a shirt and wire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The half-dressed boy was forced from his home with a T-shirt over his head but Beattie fled after his victim managed to pull the shirt off and saw his attacker. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lord Dawson yesterday referred to evidence that police had found a homosexual pornographic video - Redemption: The Abduction Series Part Three - in the bedroom of Beattie&#39;s home in Ewing Drive, Falkirk. Its theme was the abduction of young men from their homes for sexual pleasure. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lord Dawson continued: &quot;I consider your possession of the video tape as extremely sinister. In view of the circumstances surrounding this vicious crime, I regard you as an extreme danger to the public.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie was also convicted of setting fire to Lawrence&#39;s body and the judge said: &quot;I also regard the fire-raising charge as extremely serious. You were heedless of the fact people might well be asleep upstairs whose very lives would have been put in severe jeopardy. It was only by fortune that the fire did not develop into a conflagration.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The fire-raising charge is to run concurrently with the life sentence. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In a statement issued last night, Central Police Chief Constable William Wilson said: &quot;I have invited Mr James Mackay, Assistant Chief Constable of Tayside Police, to initiate a full and independent review of how we handled the inquiry. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;And, if there are any lessons to be learned as a result, we will take them on board. Until Mr Mackay&#39;s findings are made available to us, I feel it would be inappropriate to comment further.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had denied murdering Lawrence, who won a Scottish schoolboy cap on the day of the Dunblane massacre in March 1996. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Two days later, Lawrence was left with severe head wounds inflicted during a savage attack as he lay on the settee of his home in Glenbervie Drive, Larbert, Stirlingshire, watching late-night television. He died later in hospital. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The murder ended what promised to be a successful football career for the young <b>Celtic</b> player. Last night, former <b>Celtic</b> assistant manager Billy Stark said Lawrence had shown the potential to go right to the top of the sport. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;He was a level-headed youngster who loved his football and was very dedicated. Lawrence had all the attributes, not only the ability but the temperament and attitude to work hard that would have taken him right to the top.&quot;</font></font> <br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Judge missed chance to jail killer Beattie 14 years ago</b></font>   <br></h2><font size="2"><b>Daily Record 14/05/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>Stephen Rafferty</b></font> <br><font size="2">The man who murdered Lawrence Haggart was almost jailed for life 14 years ago. </font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Brian Beattie was only 19 when judge Myrella Cohen QC branded him a &quot;fire risk&quot; and a danger to the public. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">She thought about sending him away for life - but imposed a seven-year sentence instead. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">If the life term had been imposed, Beattie would have been under close scrutiny by the authorities when he got out. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Seven young men may have been spared horrific sex attacks - and promising <b>Celtic</b> star Lawrence would still be alive. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie, 33, was brought up in Airth, Stirlingshire, the youngest of Thomas and Margaret Beattie&#39;s four sons. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He was a problem child and began his criminal life at the tender age of 11. He spent his formative years in a succession of List- D schools and institutions. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">His parents&#39; marriage ended when his mum ran off with another man and set up home in Redcar, Teesside. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">She got a job as a bus conductress and her youngest son soon moved south to join her. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He began travelling the same bus routes as his mum to check on vulnerable pensioners&#39; movements so he could rob their houses. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In all, he broke into four homes belonging to elderly widows, stole valuables and set fire to their houses. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He appeared at Teesside Crown Court in March 1984 and admitted four charges of burglary and two of arson. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">While in custody, Beattie set fire to his prison cell and attempted suicide by setting fire to himself. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Judge Cohen told him: &quot;You are a danger to the public at large and you are also a danger to yourself.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After his release in 1988, Beattie&#39;s life of crime took a sinister new twist. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He moved back to Airth and in November that year started a series of depraved attacks. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie would sneak into houses in the middle of the night after watching for signs that young males lived there. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">His first victim was a 14-year-old Stenhousemuir boy, but he struggled free and Beattie ran off. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In August 1990, a 17-year-old youth sleeping in his home at Falkirk woke to find Beattie holding a pair of scissors at his stomach. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The terrified youngster was ordered to lie face down, his head was covered with a pillow and duvet and he was warned: &quot;If you look at my face I&#39;ll kill you.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie carried out a number of sickening sexual assaults on his victim, who&#39;s now 25. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Yesterday, his victim said he remembered Beattie as being &quot;calm, controlled and relaxed&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Three weeks later, Beattie carried out a similar attack on 21-year-old Lawrence Kane while his parents and older brother slept in other rooms in their Stenhousemuir home. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Yesterday, Lawrence, now a dad of one, said: &quot;I can remember waking up and he had his hand over my privates and a knife in my belly. He said if I moved he would slash me. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;I managed to push him off me and chased him out of the room. My room was never the same again after that.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence has suffered with depression since the attack. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said: &quot;It still really annoys me that I could not get my own back on him. He is always in the back of my mind. I feel inadequate because I did not get my hands on him.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The pervert struck again in October - with two attacks in five days. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He sneaked into a house in Larbert and threatened to kill an 18-year- old boy with a screwdriver before sexually assaulting him. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Then he struck at the home of a former Scotland football star and attacked his 14-year-old son. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Yesterday, that victim said: &quot;Basically he had a strict routine with all the attacks and the last time he went a step further and ended up killing this boy. I was one of the lucky ones.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie was eventually arrested in connection with some of the incidents and was released on bail at Falkirk Sheriff Court. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">But just six days later, he carried out another assault on a 20-year- old Falkirk man. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In February 1991, he was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh to 18 months for the assaults but served only eight months and was released that October. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">And just three days after being released from prison he was at it again. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He abducted a boy of 16 from his Stenhousemuir home after threatening him with a knife. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie was jailed for five years and sent to Peterhead Prison. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He was released on licence in September 1994 and for the next few months lived in Edinburgh before moving back to the Falkirk area. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">It was only a matter of time before he struck again - and, tragically, his target was Lawrence Haggart. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">DIARY OF LAWRENCE&#39;S MURDER </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">FRIDAY March 15, 1996: Lawrence Haggart attends an under-18 disco in Denny with pals. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">10.30pm: He returns home to Glenbervie Drive, Larbert.

He was interviewed early on in an initial police investigation, but was ruled out as a suspect. The focus then fell on Lawrence&#39;s 12-year-old brother Dennis. It was only after a second investigation that Beattie was charged. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In a statement yesterday, deputy chief constable Mike Currie confirmed that an officer had been suspended from duty, adding: &quot;It would be inappropriate to either identify the officer concerned or make any further comment at this time.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Last week, Central Scotland&#39;s chief constable William Wilson said the review of the case, which had been requested by Tayside assistant chief constable James MacKay, had been completed. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said: &quot;Mr MacKay has advised me that his report contains issues which will require to be addressed by the regional procurator-fiscal and the deputy chief constable.

He had catastrophic head injuries and his shoulder had been bizarrely mutilated. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie was arrested within hours of the murder, but gave an alibi saying he had been in Edinburgh to meet a man for sex and had returned straight to his caravan in Denny. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He was released and not questioned again by the team led by Detective Superintendent Jim Winning. It was only when the case was reviewed by a fresh team, led by Winning&#39;s replacement, Joe Holden, that attention again focused on Beattie. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Holden&#39;s team ruled out the possibility that Dennis or his elder brother John might have attacked Lawrence.

Mike Currie, the deputy chief constable of the Central, is understood to be taking legal advice over the case of Chief Inspector Jim Winning, who led the initial murder inquiry. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Chief Insp Winning, who is in his late 40s, has been advised by both his GP and the force&#39;s own medical officer that he should retire immediately on health grounds. Mr Currie is seeking to block this until any disciplinary proceedings have been completed. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Last week Scottish Office ministers promised to close a loophole that allows charges against police officers facing disciplinary proceedings to be dropped if they are pensioned off early on health grounds. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">A spokesman for the Scottish Office added: &quot;Ministers recognise and share public concern about a any case where a police officer can retire on the grounds of ill-health before disciplinary proceedings are completed.&quot; Chief Insp Winning has been on sick leave since before the High Court case in May in which Brian Beattie was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years imprisonment for the murder of Lawrence Haggart at his home in Larbert, Stirlingshire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The officer was excused giving evidence on medical grounds. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The officer was in charge of the initial investigation that saw Beattie, a convicted paedophile who previously had sexually assaulted a number of young males in their own homes as their families slept, brought in for questioning within hours of the savage attack. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie was released after he gave an alibi that he had been in Royal Terrace in Edinburgh, and had picked up a man for sex before returning straight to his caravan at Denny. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Suspicion then fell on Lawrence&#39;s younger brother Dennis, then 12, and his older brother John, 17. The family is now suing the force for defamation and stress. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie was subsequently charged, more than a year later and following a fresh investigation by a different team of detectives, led by Detective Chief Inspector Joe Holden. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After Beattie&#39;s conviction, William Wilson, the Chief Constable of the Central Police, ordered the independent inquiry into his force&#39;s handling of the murder investigation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence&#39;s father, Larry Haggart, claimed at the time that the first inquiry had been a &quot;terrible botch-up&quot;, and said the initial inquiry team had made the family&#39;s life a misery by insisting that Dennis, and possibly John, had attacked their brother. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After Mr Mackay handed over his report two weeks ago, Mr Wilson disclosed that it contained &quot;certain issues&quot; which would needed to be addressed by the regional procurator-fiscal at Dundee </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The report has now been passed to the Crown Office for consideration by counsel over whether it contains anything of a criminal nature. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">When he announced he had received Mr Mackay&#39;s bulky report, Mr Wilson said that while he appreciated the strong interest from the Haggart family, the public and the media, he was constrained &quot;for legal reasons&quot; from making its contents known. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">During his investigation, Mr Mackay spoke to officers involved in both inquiries, and also to the Haggart family. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">It is known that he looked at the issue of resources allocated to the first inquiry which began three days after the Dunblane massacre at a time when the resources of Scotland&#39;s second smallest force were severely stretched. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart said yesterday that as far as he was concerned, four officers involved in the initial inquiry should be required to leave the force.

The report is now with the Crown Office. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Late yesterday, Mr Currie issued a terse statement, which read: &quot;I can confirm that Supt James Winning is to retire from Central Scotland Police.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Currie has been locked in talks with legal advisers for several days to see if anything could be done to prevent Supt Winning taking early retirement on medical grounds, as recommended by both his own GP and the force&#39;s medical officer. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">It is understood both Mr Currie and Mr Wilson are deeply unhappy Mr Winning has been able to escape any form of censure over his handling of the murder investigation , which was taken over by a fresh team. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Earlier this month, Scottish Office ministers promised to close a loophole that allows charges against police officers facing disciplinary proceedings to be dropped if they are pensioned off early on health grounds. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">A Scottish Office spokesman said: &quot;Ministers recognise and share public concern about a any case where a police officer can retire on health grounds before disciplinary proceedings are completed.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The second-in-command in the initial murder investigation , Inspector John Bunyan, was suspended ten days ago following Mr Mackay&#39;s independent inquiry . </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">On Friday, the force announced that disciplinary proceedings had begun against a further three detectives involved in the heavily criticised first operation to track down Lawrence&#39;s murderer. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">It is understood that two of the detectives, Sergeant Alan Stewart, who is stationed at Falkirk, and Sergeant Bob Beveridge at Grangemouth, have already been moved from plain clothes to uniformed duties. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Within hours of the assault in March 1996 on Lawrence in his home at Larbert, Stirlingshire, Mr Winning&#39;s inquiry team questioned a convicted paedophile, Brian Beattie. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie, who had a record of sexually motivated attacks on a number of young males while they slept in their homes in the Falkirk area, was released after he gave an alibi that he had been in Royal Terrace in Edinburgh, and had picked up a man for sex, before returning to his caravan at Denny. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Suspicion then fell on Lawrence&#39;s younger brother, Dennis, then 12, and his older brother John, 17. The family is now suing Central Scotland Police for defamation and stress. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">More than a year later, Beattie was charged after the fresh investigating team was brought in. At the High Court in Edinburgh in May, Beattie was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years for the murder. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Winning, who is in his late forties, went off sick a short while before the trial, and was excused from giving evidence on medical grounds. He has since been on sick leave .</font></font> <br>       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody>   </table>    <h2><font size="2"><b>Family of murder victim get apology</b></font> <br></h2><font size="2"><b>The Scotsman 09/10/1998</b></font> <font size="2"><b>JOHN SMITH</b></font><br><br><font size="2">A SENIOR policeman apologised to the family of the murdered teenager Lawrence Haggart yesterday for mistakes made by his force in their investigation. </font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mike Currie, depute chief constable of Central Scotland police, said that the Haggart family expected, and should have received, a much better performance from the force after Lawrence, 15, a Celtic youth player, was murdered in March 1996. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The initial inquiry team focused their attention on Lawrence&#39;s brothers Dennis, then 12, and John, 17, after turning their attention away from a convicted paedophile, Brian Beattie. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie gave an alibi that he had been in Edinburgh and had picked up a man for sex and had then returned to his caravan at Denny in Stirlingshire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He was charged 18 months later after a fresh inquiry, and in May at the High Court in Edinburgh he was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years for the murder of Lawrence in his home in Larbert, Stirlingshire. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Currie met Lawrence&#39;s mother Janet, 39, and her two sons yesterday, and then met Mrs Haggart&#39;s estranged husband Larry, 38. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He said he had explained what action he had taken in line with recommendations in the report into the force&#39;s handling of the murder hunt by James Mackay, Tayside&#39;s assistant chief constable. He had also addressed the family&#39;s individual concerns over how the investigation was conducted. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Currie said he had apologised to the family, on behalf of the force, &quot;for the actions of any of our officers who heightened their distress at what can only be described as an inconceivably tragic time of their lives. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">&quot;Lessons have been learned by the force and steps have been taken to ensure that the mistakes which were made in this case are not repeated.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After a half-hour meeting with Mr Currie, Mr Haggart said he was &quot;very happy&quot; with the apology, but pledged to continue the family&#39;s legal action against the force for stress and defamation. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mrs Haggart, John and Dennis left police headquarters in Stirling without commenting. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In August, The Scotsman disclosed that Mr Currie, who is responsible for all disciplinary matters in the force, had taken legal advice over the possibility of preventing Jim Winning, the detective superintendent who led the initial inquiry, from retiring early on health grounds. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He was told he could not stop Mr Winning&#39;s retirement, which ensured that the officer escaped any disciplinary action. Only days earlier the Scottish Office promised to close a loophole that allowed charges against police officers facing disciplinary proceedings to be dropped if they are pensioned off early on health grounds. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The second-in-command in the initial Haggart murder inquiry, Det Inspector John Bunyan, was suspended in August after Mr Mackay&#39;s report, and three other sergeants disciplined. Two of them were detectives and have been transferred to uniformed duties. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After he received Mr Mackay&#39;s report, Central&#39;s chief constable William Wilson disclosed that it contained &quot;certain issues&quot; which would need to be addressed by the regional procurator-fiscal at Dundee. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The report was then passed to the Crown Office for consideration by counsel over whether it contained anything of a criminal nature. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">A Crown Office spokesman said that the report was still being considered by Crown Counsel. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Haggart said last night that Mr Currie had done &quot;a great job&quot; but he felt the apology should have been made by the officers who made the mistakes. He called for them to be sacked for the agony they had put the family through. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The apology by the force to the Haggart family is the latest by police to wronged parties. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In August, John Orr, Strathclyde&#39;s chief constable, apologised to a former officer, Lawrence Ramadas, who was the victim of racism. Mr Ramadas has rejoined the force. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">In June the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, apologised to the parents of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence.

He also claims Lord Dawson misdirected the jury in his summing-up at the end of the four-week trial. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">His grounds for appeal were lodged at the High Court by his legal team led by solicitor Mr Paul Telford. The Falkirk-based lawyer said the grounds for appeal included &quot;information that was brought to our attention after the trial&quot;. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The appeal will be heard in due course by three High Court judges. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">When he sentenced Beattie to life, Lord Dawson recommended that he served at least 15 years for his &quot;brutal and ferocious&quot; crime. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">He told Beattie: &quot;I regard you as an extreme danger to the public.&quot; </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie had previous convictions for sex offences against teenage males. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Celtic youth footballer Lawrence Haggart was 15 when he was murdered at his home in Larbert, Stirlingshire, almost three years ago. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The original investigation by Central Scotland Police&#39;s CID team allowed Beattie to walk free just hours after the killing. It then focused on the footballer&#39;s brother, Denis, 12, for more than a year. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">After a new CID squad brought Beattie to justice the force apologised to the Haggart family. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Lawrence&#39;s father Mr Larry Haggart, a painter and decorator of Dunipace, said he would never rest until every officer in the first investigation was sacked. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">The man who led the first inquiry, Detective Superintendent Jim Winning, retired on ill health grounds with a full pension. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Two Detective Sergeants in his squad - Alan Stewart and Bob Beveridge - were disciplined and demoted to uniform duties. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Winning&#39;s number two, Detective Inspector John Bunyon, now faces a disciplinary hearing into his part in the original inquiry.

But they released him, and made Lawrence&#39;s younger brother Denis a prime suspect. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Beattie, 34, was only rearrested more than a year later after different detectives took over the case. Detective Superintendent Jim Winning, who led the original hunt, escaped punishment by retiring on health grounds. </font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000000">Mr Bunyan was suspended last August, and is appearing before a hearing chaired by Lothian and Borders Chief Constable Roy Cameron.
