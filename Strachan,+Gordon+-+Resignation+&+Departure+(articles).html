Mark McGhee, of Motherwell, and Craig Levein, the Dundee United manager, are  also contenders. Tony Mowbray, the West Bromwich Albion manager and a former  Celtic player, could also come into consideration.</div> <div class="TailParas">(c) 2009 Times Newspapers Limited.

Glasgow has been a hot-house of rumour for two weeks about his  imminent going, and last Thursday Strachan himself even fuelled that speculation  by specifically intimating to the assembled media at Celtic that he would take  no questions about his future at the club, but only about what, in fact,  transpired to be his final match in charge, against Heart of Midlothian at  Celtic Park on Sunday.</div> <div class="TailParas">At a routine pre-match press conference, if that request  didn&#39;t make some of us there suspicious, then what would? Strachan has also  chosen the right time to get out of Celtic. After three excellent seasons at the  club, during which he delivered three successive titles, a Scottish Cup and a  League Cup, as well as making significant progress in Europe, something stale  has invaded his team this season. For sure, Strachan came lose to making that  four titles in a row, and Celtic had already claimed the Co-operative Insurance  Cup by beating Rangers in March, but his team&#39;s deathly performance against  Hearts on Sunday was not just season-ending fatigue. Strachan and his players  had long since begun to lose their collective imagination.</div> <div class="TailParas">Strachan can leave Celtic a relatively proud man &mdash; not  something that can always be said of outgoing Old Firm managers. Funnily enough,  Celtic have now had two such departures in a row, following Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s  leaving in 2005 with a similar sense of accomplishment. The key difference  between the two is that the fans adored O&#39;Neill, whereas many of them have been  cool towards Strachan and some openly disdainful.</div> <div class="TailParas">The reasons for the latter cynicism are complicated, and  too often reduced to glib soundbites. For sure, O&#39;Neill met all the credentials  of the cultural inheritance of Celtic, being Irish and Catholic, and Strachan  did not, being a nippy Presbyterian from Edinburgh. But this aspect is often  wildly overstated in the media. Only a small section of fans have had the  temerity to object to Strachan on grounds of his background.</div> <div class="TailParas">Much more germane to those who have disdained him has been  Strachan&#39;s style of play &mdash; ponderous and laboured this season &mdash; and his  signings, in particular players such as Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios  Samaras. Even then, however, the debate is highly subjective. Vennegoor of  Hesselink, in fact, has averaged almost a goal every two games in his SPL league  career with Celtic, and almost single-handedly rescued their dramatic title  challenge in the near-miraculous closing weeks of the 2007-08 season.</div> <div class="TailParas">One other, perhaps more significant aspect about Strachan  which perturbed quite a few Celtic fans was his recurring facetiousness or  sarcasm on the public airwaves, which made more than a few supporters cringe.  When this point was put to Strachan he would defend himself stoutly, but the  truth is, he probably didn&#39;t always strike the right balance between wit and  outright aggression. On more than one occasion a sports journalist would be  belittled, and, while quite a few of us got on very well with him, you couldn&#39;t  turn a blind eye to his sometimes unkind conduct towards others.</div> <div class="TailParas">Of course, it is a two-way street. Strachan, with some  justification, complained that the newspapers&#39; coverage is too often  characterised by exaggeration, hysteria or downright fiction. &quot;Why should I have  to deal with all that stuff &mdash; it is plainly wrong,&quot; he told me when I interviewd  him back in 2007. I must admit, I was at a loss to put up a defence. The  difference is that Martin O&#39;Neill had a withering but often silent contempt for  all this. Strachan, on the other hand, expressed his disapproval by open  insult.</div> <div class="TailParas">After four intense years at Celtic, he can take a break in  the knowledge that his stock is high in England. He will, surely, have little  bother picking up a decent job if he is prepared to wait long enough. It may  even come sooner rather than later, if Sunderland or Newcastle United or any  other such slumbering giant chooses to take him on.</div> <div class="TailParas">Strachan has also shown that, when in charm mode, he can be  multi-talented. He was an intriguing and thought-provoking sidekick to Adrian  Chiles in the early days of Match of the Day 2 on BBC Two, picking games apart  with shrewd analysis and easing himself comfortably into pre-recorded audio  packages. With a settled family life built around a seemingly impregnable  marriage, there is quite a bit about Strachan&#39;s life which is rewarding.</div> <div class="TailParas">Football, however, will lure him back, sooner rather than  later. He has left Celtic of his own accord, which is another minor blessing in  a hiring-and-firing business. Strachan is by no means done with the game  yet.</div> <div class="TailParas">(c) 2009 Times Newspapers Limited.

But then this was nothing new. He had become used to operating without fanfare  at Parkhead ever since being unveiled, and was perhaps simply grateful that  those fans who drifted disconsolately away from Parkhead after the goal-less  draw with Hearts had chosen not to turn on him.</div> <div class="TailParas">That reaction, of course, would have been unjustified, but  then it is possible to say Strachan has not been treated fairly from the word  go. His greatest perceived crime, among many, was to not be Martin O&#39;Neill. He  might now reflect that indeed he wasn&#39;t - his record over four seasons was just  as good, if not comparatively better, than O&#39;Neill&#39;s. He could also contend that  not only did he match O&#39;Neill, his celebrated predecessor, but he did so with  reduced resources.</div> <div class="TailParas">This isn&#39;t an opinion that will find favour in east end of  Glasgow bars, where the issue of who might replace Strachan is already being  debated with a relish which suggests few are pausing to toast the former  manager.</div> <div class="TailParas">The reaction of many Celtic fans is that this departure  comes four years too late. He should, they argue, have stepped down after the  calamity of the 5-0 reversal against Artmedia Bratislava, a result which some  had hoped, even then, would do for Strachan what the 3-1 home defeat to  Inverness Caledonian Thistle did for John Barnes.</div> <div class="TailParas">Yet this was Strachan&#39;s first match in charge of a team  still a long way from being his own. The manager recovered to lead Celtic to the  championship that season, and then did so again in two subsequent campaigns. He  also got it right in the Champions League, twice reaching the last 16. In any  assessment of his time at Parkhead, victories over AC Milan and Manchester  United must be granted greater prominence than a defeat in his opening match,  one that was so nearly over-turned at home.</div> <div class="TailParas">But the recollection of these passionate, sometimes wild,  nights at Parkhead has not encouraged fans to treat him with half the reverence  reserved for Jock Stein, or even O&#39;Neill. That he does not measure up to the  former is no slight on Strachan, since no-one in the club&#39;s history does. But it  is reasonable to state that he was a more than adequate replacement for O&#39;Neill,  whose reputation survived a surrender of the championship right at the end of  his last league match against Motherwell.</div> <div class="TailParas">The Celtic job is hard enough, but it is doubly difficult  when asked to succeed a lauded figure. O&#39;Neill himself waltzed into Parkhead  while safe in the knowledge that he could do no worse than Barnes, who had left  four months earlier. The trick, when agreeing to manage the Old Firm, is do so  at a time of crisis. Just ask Walter Smith.</div> <div class="TailParas">Fans refused to warm to someone whose back pages displayed  not only no association with the club, but worse, included episodes interpreted  as being anti-Celtic. His time as a player with Aberdeen saw him regularly fall  out with those in hooped shirts, while one fan&#39;s attempt to shake him by the  throat after one tangle too many cast him out as a player they loved to  hate.</div> <div class="TailParas">But one thing they could not deny is that he was always a  winner, although his departure, just 24 hours after the disappointment of losing  the league title, also marks him out as something of a pragmatist. How can he  hope to navigate perilous qualification rounds of the Champions League, never  mind the group stage itself, with a team that is the product of lowered  boardroom ambition at Parkhead?</div> <div class="TailParas">Six domestic trophies from 12 is an acceptable return, but  it is Europe which should frame his tenure, although even this can fall one of  two ways. His supporters will point to Celtic&#39;s progress to the last 16 of the  Champions League in successive seasons, where they fell to eventual winners AC  Milan only after extra-time on the first occasion, and then a rampant Barcelona  12 months later. But failure to arrest an appalling run of form in away group  matches gives what his enemies regard as sound reason to condemn him.</div> <div class="TailParas">Whether Strachan would have stayed even had he won a fourth  title is a moot point. Strachan comes across as the kind of person who is not  content to rest on his laurels. He left Southampton on a high, and as a player  liked to taste new experiences, incurring Alex Ferguson&#39;s displeasure when  engineering a move from Aberdeen to Manchester United. He later moved to Leeds  and Coventry.</div> <div class="TailParas">His relationship with certain players at Celtic had begun  to fracture, with Aiden McGeady unlikely to mourn the manager&#39;s departure. He is  joined by former AC Milan midfielder Massimo Donati, cast by Strachan into a  wilderness. This is one area of his management where it is easy to find fault.  Although relentlessly supportive of his players in public, his banishment of  certain individuals bordered on being vindictive. Bobo Balde&#39;s crime was to have  accepted a generous new contract from Celtic, while Derek Riordan, despite his  challenging behaviour, could still have expected more support.</div> <div class="TailParas">The flip side to this are those who must count themselves  in the pro-Strachan camp. Artur Boruc could not have complained had he found  himself on the sidelines after a series of errors on the pitch and scrapes off  it. Gary Caldwell has seen his career blossom at Celtic to the extent where he  has been named player of the year by football writers as well as fellow  players.</div> <div class="TailParas">But how Strachan is remembered will remain in the charge of  the supporters, where the harsh judgment of the majority is guaranteed to  overwhelm the more dispassionate verdict. This less popular assessment deserves  a hearing. Not as good as Stein, granted, but the equal - at the least - of  O&#39;Neill.</div> <div class="TailParas">(c) 2009 </div> <div class="TailParas">The Scotsman</div><br><div class="Title"><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>Strachan quits Celtic</h3></div> <div class="Provided"> <div>25 May 2009</div>Provided by: The Irish  Examiner</div><br><div class="LeadPara">Celtic manager Gordon Strachan has quit following their  failure to clinch a fourth successive title.</div> <div class="LeadPara">The club announced on their website that Strachan &ndash; who won  three titles and three domestic cups in his four years in charge &ndash; had decided  to step down.</div> <div class="TailParas">Strachan said: &quot;I have enjoyed my time immensely at Celtic  and clearly I will be sad to leave this great club.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Strachan refused to discuss his future immediately after  their final Clydesdale Bank Premier League game of the season, a 0-0 draw with  Hearts.</div> <div class="TailParas">But his departure is no surprise after he failed to gain  total support from a number of Celtic fans despite his success at home and in  Europe, where he twice led Celtic into the last 16 of the Champions  League.</div> <div class="TailParas">Strachan added on celticfc.net: &quot;As I have said before,  Celtic is a special club, with special supporters.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;There is no club like it and it has been an absolute  honour and privilege to be the club&rsquo;s manager for the past four years.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;We have done all we can to bring success to the club and  we were delighted to deliver three SPL titles, other domestic silverware, as  well as making some great progress in Europe.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It is just disappointing that we did not manage the fourth  championship.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;However, the players can hold their heads high in terms of  what they have done for the club in recent years.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I would like to thank the Celtic board for all the support  they have given me during the past four years, in particular Dermot Desmond,  John Reid, Peter Lawwell and former chairman Brian Quinn &ndash; I could not have  asked for any more support.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I thank all the players I have worked with at the club  and, of course, my backroom team for the backing and assistance which they have  given me.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I thank the fans too for the tremendous support which they  have given both myself and the players. I wish Celtic and our supporters nothing  but success for the future.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Strachan&#39;s success came despite having a much smaller  transfer budget and wage bill than was afforded to predecessor Martin  O&#39;Neill.</div> <div class="TailParas">Parkhead chief executive Peter Lawwell paid tribute to the  former Southampton and Coventry boss, who has been linked with the vacant  Sunderland post.</div> <div class="TailParas">Lawwell said: &quot;Gordon has given everything to the club and  worked tirelessly to bring success to Celtic.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;He has achieved so much at both domestic and European  levels.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;It has been a pleasure to work closely with Gordon and he  leaves the club with all our best wishes.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;We thank Gordon for his commitment and achievements at the  club and we also thank our fans for backing us all the way this season.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Our fans know how to support their club and we will be  doing all we can to once again bring back the title to Celtic Park, something  which our support deserves.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">&copy; Irish Examiner, 2009.
