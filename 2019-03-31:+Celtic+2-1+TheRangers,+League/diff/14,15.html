Boyata, Tierney and Lustig went off injured during the game. Toljan came on and was adequate.</li><li>Rogic and Ntcham return from injury. Rogic was very much off the pace, and big criticism for him being on the pitch.</li><li>Lennon decision making for this game questioned by many, with Burke, Weah and Sinclair benched, with Hayes starting. Hayes had a good game but was pulled at half-time, led to strange situation where many criticised Lennon for Hayes being a starter then Lennon was criticised for taking him off!</li><li>One steward was left badly injured and had to be stretchered away following celebrations spilling over onto the pitch.</li><li>Ryan Kent threw a half-punch/shove at Scott Brown and incredibly was NOT sent off or even given a yellow card! <br></li><li>Morelos sent off for an elbow in the face to Scott Brown. 8 games v Celtic and this supposedly &pound;20m player still hasn&#39;t scored v Celtic. He has been sent off repeatedly this season.</li><li>Back after unwanted internationals in the past week; Callum McGregor was made captain, Tierney pulled out of matches. Scotland lost to Kazakhstan 3-0 then won 2-0 to San Marino. Knives out for Alex EBT McLeish who should never have been given the role. Ireland defeated Gibraltar 1-0.</li><li>Sevco&#39;s final challenge for silverware having been knocked out by Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup two weeks back. So season is now over.</li><li>Has Boyata played his last match for Celtic? Came off with a hamstring injury.<br></li><li> Timothy Weah makes the #NxGn 2019 list of the top young talents in the world. Congrats, and all this despite having had little gametime with Celtic.</li><li>Celtic had lost their manager of late (Brendan Rodgers), had their worst start of the league season in 20 years, had lost huge number of players to injury over the season.... Yet still comfortably in front!<br></li><li>Celtic confirm striker Leigh Griffiths will be returning to the club this week to commence fitness and performance work at Lennoxtown.</li><li>Ross County defeat Welsh Connah&#39;s Quay Nomads 3-1 in the IRN-BRU Cup Final thanks to three goals in the last 15 minutes Congratulations to the Staggies!</li><li>Rangers assistant Gary McAllister attacked outside pub. He has been left requiring hospital treatment after being assaulted in Yorkshire/Leeds. He was attacked as he waited for a taxi. Disgraceful by whoever done it.   </li><li>Six arrests have been made over alleged offences which took place at the Old Firm clash.Three  were in connection with sectarian breaches of  the peace, one was to do  with being drunk and incapable, one was for  resisting arrest, while  another was for attempting to enter the stadium  with alcohol.<br>All of the alleged offences took place in and around Celtic Park on Sunday.</li><li><div>Three people have been stabbed in Glasgow City Centre during a fight between Celtic and Rangers fans. s witnesses described seeing a &lsquo;horrific mass brawl&rsquo; break out between &rsquo;15 or so people&rsquo; close to Blackfriars Street. Evening Times next day wrongly stated one of the fans (a Celtic fan) had died. He thankfully hadn&#39;t.</div></li><li><h3><span class="diffAdd">Post-Match</span></h3></li><li><span class="diffAdd">Scott Brown has been cited by the Scottish FA for &lsquo;not acting in the best interests of Association Football&rsquo; after.

The  guy who antagonised it all from the beginning deserves to be punished  as well. When you&rsquo;re provoked, it&rsquo;s only fair that both sides get  punished in my view.&quot;<br><b>Stevie Gerard (Sevco manager) on Brown</b><br><br>(TheManHimself of KDS)<br>Fantastic 1st half performance and FT result, but we should have been out of sight by HT.<br> Excellent performances from Ajer, Edouard and Ntcham (until he ran out of steam).<br> Hope Boyata is fit for Hampden.<br> <br> In two home league games against them this season, we&#39;ve dominated possession but scored only 3 goals:<br> - 2 counter attacks from our own half (Ntcham, Edouard)<br> - 1 interception of a loose pass in their half (Forrest)<br> We really need to figure out how to turn our possession and territorial  dominance into clear goal-scoring chances &amp; convert them.<br> <br> Lennon&#39;s selection, tactics &amp; substitutions not what we need to take us to the next level.<br><br>(fatboab of KDS)<br>Fantastic first half that didnt get the goals we deserved, but wtf  happened second half? Was that complacency, or fatigue ? Whatever  happened , we encouraged them back into a game they had lost, and they  took advantage. We only responded when Boyata went off, and we got the  goal. Great performances from Eddie and Ajer, and I thought Lustig was  excellent.<br><br> However, we have to put Tierney into rehab now, and decide on who fills in at left back for the rest of the season.<br> <br>All in all, a great day out .

But the prime focus of Gerrard&rsquo;s reflections will surely be on whether he can possibly cure the suspect temperament which continues to undermine the talent of his top-scorer Morelos.<br><br>Celtic already looked to be taking control of the contest when the Colombian striker perpetrated his latest senseless act of indiscipline. His departure from proceedings, just four minutes after Edouard had opened the scoring for the hosts, suggested the rest of the game would simply be an exercise in damage limitation for Gerrard&rsquo;s side.<br><br>On a day when only victory would breathe any semblance of life into the title race from Rangers&rsquo; perspective, they had started brightly enough. Gerrard reverted to the starting line-up from their 1-0 win in the previous Old Firm fixture at Ibrox in December, meaning a recall in midfield for Ross McCrorie.<br><br>The intention was clearly to press high and try to get on to the front foot as much as possible and there was an early scare for Celtic when Boyata had to cut out a dangerous cross from Kent. But that initial sign of promise proved illusory for Rangers. The hosts soon got a grip of the midfield battle with Olivier Ntcham, making his first appearance since that Ibrox defeat, at the heart of their best work.<br><br>The French midfielder forced Allan McGregor into his first save of the afternoon, the Rangers goalkeeper reacting smartly to keep out a close-range effort after a fine break and cross from the left by Kieran Tierney. There were a couple of less certain moments from McGregor as Celtic stepped up the tempo and that nervousness seemed to spread through the Rangers defence as they came under increasing pressure.<br><br>They needlessly made life harder for themselves at times, Joe Worrall guilty more than once of giving possession away cheaply. One such error from Worrall forced his central defensive partner Connor Goldson to make a tremendous recovery tackle to deny Edouard inside the penalty area.<br><br>But Goldson had no answer when Edouard made the breakthrough in the 28th minute. The goal came from a rapid Celtic counter-attack after Rangers failed to make anything of a promising free-kick situation. It left them on the back foot as Forrest&rsquo;s exceptional pass set Edouard surging clear of Goldson into the penalty area, the striker coolly beating McGregor with a firm left-foot shot.<br><br>Rangers&rsquo; afternoon then appeared to be unravelling in ignominious fashion when Morelos, after appearing to be clipped on the foot by Scott Brown, swung an elbow into the face of the Celtic captain. Referee Bobby Madden immediately reached for his top pocket and it took some time for Morelos to accept his fate as he remonstrated with assistant referee Alan Mulvanny before trudging off the pitch.<br><br>It needed another fine save from McGregor to prevent Tierney doubling Celtic&rsquo;s lead before the interval and the prospect of another heavy defeat at Parkhead loomed large for the 800 Rangers fans inside the ground.<br><br>Celtic started the second half with Scott Sinclair replacing Jonny Hayes and the winger forced McGregor into action again as the hosts sought to turn the screw.<br>Andy Halliday, left, confronts Celtic captain Scott Brown, right, as Scott Bain intervenes. Picture: Getty<br>Rangers&#39; Alfredo Morelos protests his innocence as Celtic captain Scott Brown lies on the turf. Picture: SNS<br><br>But a degree of slackness gradually worked its way into Celtic&rsquo;s play and Rangers enjoyed their best spell of the game. Despite the absence of Morelos, they retained a focal point up front through the excellent Kent and his display was rewarded with a fine goal in the 63rd minute.<br><br>It was by far the best move of the match, James Tavernier linking up with Daniel Candeias down the right. Tavernier latched on to the winger&rsquo;s back-heeled return pass and fed the ball to Kent, who burst through the middle of the Celtic defence and beat Scott Bain with a right-foot shot.<br><br>Rangers now sensed the opportunity to grab the most unlikely of victories and could have gone in front in the 74th minute when Ryan Jack blazed over from a good position after more fine work from Kent.<br><br>As the game ebbed and flowed  compellingly in the closing stages, it was Celtic who struck the crucial blow. It was a horror moment for Rangers captain Tavernier, who was woefully short with a pass which Callum McGregor intercepted. He fed Edouard who held off a couple of challenges before squaring the ball for Forrest to drill it home.<br><br>The match concluded in an unsavoury manner with scuffles breaking out among some players as Rangers took objection to the nature of Celtic captain Scott Brown&rsquo;s celebrations in front of the visiting support.<br><br>It leaves the Scottish FA&rsquo;s compliance officer with a heavy in-tray this morning but along the corridor at Hampden, the SPFL can already order the engraving of Celtic&rsquo;s name on the Premiership trophy once more.  <br><div></div><div></div><div>  <br><h3>Andrew Smith&rsquo;s blow-by-blow account of the Celtic-Rangers fight</h3><br>Andrew Smith<br>Published: 20:14 Sunday 31 March 2019<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/andrew-smith-s-blow-by-blow-account-of-the-celtic-rangers-fight-1-4898990<br><br>Highly unusual, periodically unruly and ultimately, entirely unhinged. Nay, utterly, entirely unhinged in the minutes that followed full-time. The repercussions that ensue from those wild scenes ought to have SFA compliance officer Clare Whyte clearing her desk of any  other business for at least a week.<br><br>All season we have hammered on about  unacceptable behaviour from supporters in the stands. Yesterday, the barneyfest that followed pathetically provocative celebrations from Celtic captain Scott Brown in front of the tiny knot of Rangers supporters in the stadium represented unacceptable behaviour of the most extraordinary kind from both sets of players.<br><br>Frankly, &ldquo;shame-game&rdquo; derbies of the past pale when set against the sustained scrapping &ndash; with haymakers thrown, players wrestled to the ground and stewards struggling to separate the warring parties &ndash; sparked by Andy Halliday stomping over to Brown in a rage and shoving him after the Celtic captain&rsquo;s sustained goading of the visiting  support.<br><br>The 34-year-old was the lightning rod for the controversies that set ablaze what was actually a compelling football contest. Brown&rsquo;s dig at the heel of Alfredo Morelos that provoked the Colombian brainlessly to swing an elbow into his face &ndash; his hair-trigger temper finally exhausting the patience of his manager Steven Gerrard, who afterwards deemed a fifth red shown to the striker this season one too many &ndash; felt like it was going to be the flashpoint of a day in which Rangers were valiant against a weary-looking home side.<br><br>Brown contrived to decide otherwise when he stood ten yards from the corner housing the Rangers support and gave it large. At length. He did &ldquo;the Broony&rdquo; celebration, whooped and waved his arms in victory again and again and when at last electing to walk away, gave it a  get-it-up-you gesture.<br><br>That final nose-rubbing was the snapping point for Halliday, who was given a second  yellow in the tunnel for igniting a mass brawl. It is impossible to pick the bones out of every altercation because so many fights were then picked. Substitute Rangers keeper Wes Foderingham, looking suitably menacing with hood up and puffy jacket that was puffed-out, seemed to completely lose the plot and become one of the main maddies. Ibrox winger Daniel Candeias, who had earlier been taken off, appeared another. One of them appeared to deck Celtic keeper Scott Bain. Kristopher Ajer, who had indulged in needless taunting of the Rangers fans alongside his captain, also seemed to end up on the ground during the slugfest that involved players, officials and stewards. It lasted for what seemed at least a minute, with order only restored after Gerrard had marched into the middle of the battleground and demanded calm from his troops. Candeias appeared to get involved with a steward that was seeking to hold him back while Celtic defender Mikael Lustig, rarely an innocent in such incidents, ended up with his shirt practically ripped from his back, the garment torn from neck to navel to leave his chest exposed. One eyewitness was under the impression the jersey pull that caused the damage was referee Bobby Madden attempting to hold back the ever-spoiling-for-a-fight Swede. With what went on at the close of yesterday&rsquo;s confrontation, Lustig must have thought all his Christmases had come at once.<br><br>This unholy rumble was a spectacle rarely witnessed in even the intemperate history of this fixture. It was that unseemly and yet, let&rsquo;s not pretend otherwise, there is always something of the guilty pleasure in watching a football post-match produce the antics that might follow at the end of a Conor McGregor UFC bout.<br><br>The fall-out will involve retrospective sanctions for as many of the combatants that Whyte chooses to haul up. And, even aside from this, a retrospective red for Ryan Kent appears a certainty after the winger pushed Brown &ndash; who else? &ndash; in the face with straight arms in the immediate aftermath of James Forrest&rsquo;s  86th-minute winner, a goal that came after  ten-man Rangers had roared back at Celtic to equalise through Kent in 63 minutes.<br><br>In terms of the football, the first derby win for Neil Lennon since his return as interim manager following Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; flight to Leicester City was, as the Irishman acknowledged, an occasion where he was brilliantly served by a towering display from Odsonne Edouard, who fashioned a brilliant 28th-minute opener and turned provider for Forrest&rsquo;s clincher that as good as secured an eighth straight title for Celtic. Yet the afternoon will not be viewed in terms of the football. It was rendered almost incidental by the outrageous scenes at the close, never mind that Celtic supporters spilled on to the track at Edouard&rsquo;s goal and overturned advertising hoardings to leave a steward injured.<br><br>Celtic facing up to Rangers produces a derby that never fails to produce incident, in part because it stirs emotions that result in so many touched by it failing to keep it together. Yesterday, a host of them lost it in spectacular fashion.</div><div></div><div></div><div><h3>  Neil Lennon slams &lsquo;unacceptable&rsquo; treatment of Scott Brown by Rangers</h3>Remaining Time -2:44<br>David Gunn<br>Email<br>Published: 15:24 Sunday 31 March 2019<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/neil-lennon-slams-unacceptable-treatment-of-scott-brown-by-rangers-1-4898907<br>Neil Lennon has leapt to the defence of captain Scott Brown after Sunday&rsquo;s Old Firm encounter at Celtic Park.<br><br>The hosts won the game 2-1 thanks to a late James Forrest winner, but the major talking points centred around the home skipper.<br><br>Alfredo Morelos saw red for a first-half elbow on his opponent, while Ryan Kent was lucky to escape punishment after appearing to punch Brown after Celtic had netted their second.<br><br>There was also a post-match bust-up after Andy Halliday confronted Brown.

Not long after, Ntcham had another chance but sclaffed it wide. Rangers had little possession and little momentum - and then they fell behind.<br><br>It was a counter-attack that did it - swift, direct, unstoppable. Daniel Candeias gave it away at one end and Edouard went galloping down the other. The striker ran and ran. He bamboozled the retreating Worrall, made a little space for himself and then finished with aplomb.<br>Watch: Celtic &amp; Rangers players clash after final whistle<br><br>His 19th goal of the season was acclaimed lustily by the home support - a little too lustily. In the corner of the ground some Celtic fans spilled over the barrier and on to the edge of the pitch. A steward was knocked over in the process and needed treatment. The football authorities will need to take a little look at what happened in those moments.<br><br>Rangers&#39; day went from bad to worse a few minutes later when Morelos walked. He was wound up by Brown, who flicked his heels as both men were jogging downfield, but the reaction - a swinging arm straight into Brown&#39;s face - was (again) the most ridiculous overreaction, the act of a player with little self-control and a very loose grasp on what it is to be a good professional.<br><br><br>At that stage you wouldn&#39;t have given tuppence for Rangers chances, but from a position very firmly under the cosh they fronted up and turned the game on its head.<br><br>They could - and probably should - have had a penalty early in the second half when Tavernier went down under a challenge from Scott Sinclair, who came on at the break for Jonny Hayes. Sinclair was involved again five minutes later when Callum McGregor put him one on one with McGregor in the Rangers goal, the keeper winning the duel.<br><br>For all their early dominance, Celtic were still not at their fluent best and their level dropped bit by bit as the contest wore on. They became flat and unthreatening. The gas went out of quite a few of them and Celtic Park became jumpy.<br><br>It grew jumpier still when Kent brushed off Brown and Mikael Lustig to score a wonderful equaliser. That goal made the stadium a little more nervous and a little angrier. Boyata and Tierney went off injured, the former punching the dugout in fury.<br><br>Celtic ran out of subs and played the last 15 minutes with only 10 men.

Four minutes before the end, when Lennon was beginning to get stick from sections of his own support, Tavernier gave it away and the champions pounced. McGregor fed it into the terrific Edouard, who laid it off to the onrushing Forrest. The winger finished emphatically and, suddenly, Celtic Park was alive again, liberated from the tyranny of a hard-pressing Rangers.<br><br>Even at that late stage, the visitors had a huge chance to level it when Kent&#39;s shot was spilled by Scott Bain. Just as Worrall was about to put the ball into Celtic&#39;s net, Ajer got there first and hoofed it clear. The Norwegian celebrated like a fighter would greet a knockout. In a sense, it was. Celtic are now 13 points clear at the top of the league and have all but disappeared over the horizon from the rest.<br><br>On full-time, there was a bitter melee, sparked by Brown and Halliday and then added to by multiple others from both sides. Lustig ended up parading around the pitch with his torn shirt hanging off him. Bobby Madden showed Halliday a red card after the game.<br><br>There will be an examination of what happened amid the confusion, but what&#39;s indisputable is that despite Rangers throwing everything they had at Celtic, it just wasn&#39;t enough.<br><br><br><br><h3>BBC</h3>Celtic 2-1 Rangers: Neil Lennon angry at Scott Brown treatment<br><br> From the section Celtic <br><br>Watch: Lennon not happy with Brown &#39;treatment&#39;<br><br>Rangers should have had two men sent off during Sunday&#39;s Old Firm game, says Celtic manager Neil Lennon.<br><br>Ryan Kent shoved Scott Brown to the ground as Celtic&#39;s captain tried to prevent him retrieving the ball for kick-off after James Forrest&#39;s winner.<br><br>But Rangers boss Steven Gerrard, whose side lost 2-1, says Brown &quot;deserved to be punished&quot; after also being involved in Alfredo Morelos&#39; earlier dismissal.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not happy with the treatment of Scott Brown today,&quot; Lennon said.<br><br> Celtic win Old Firm derby to go 13 points clear<br> Podcast: &#39;Celtic are just not prepared to be beaten&#39;<br><br>Morelos reacted to Brown clipping his heels off the ball by striking the midfielder in the face.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s been elbowed [by Morelos] and then pushed or punched in the face by another player and really Rangers should have been down to nine men,&quot; Lennon told BBC Scotland.<br><br>&quot;Ryan Kent, after we scored the second goal, has either slapped or punched him in the face and it&#39;s just unacceptable at this level of football.&quot;<br><br>After the final whistle, Brown was also involved a melee which led to Rangers Andy Halliday being red carded by Bobby Madden.<br><br>The Celtic captain received no sanction for that, or for either of the earlier incidents - but was booked for a foul on Scott Arfield - and Gerrard believes &quot;it&#39;s only fair that both sides get punished&quot;.<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re playing against a player who loves to antagonise,&quot; Gerrard told Sky Sports. &quot;Morelos and Kent are both provoked.

They&#39;re a credit to the club.<br><br>&quot;With the experience we&#39;ve got we should have handled moments a bit better. But we galvanised ourselves and scored a great goal.&quot;<br><br><br>Scott Brown knows how to get under the skin of opposition players and he enjoys it. He thrives on it. His shoulders are pinned back when Celtic were enjoying that first-half domination. They weren&#39;t so pinned back in the second half. That was a spell in the game where we all felt Celtic had been rattled.<br><br>He is entitled to go and celebrate with the fans. But the area in which he is doing it is antagonistic.
