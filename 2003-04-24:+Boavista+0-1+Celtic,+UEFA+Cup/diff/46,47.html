A hopeful Alan Thompson free-kick was flicked  on by the head of John Hartson, allowing Larsson a sight of goal, but  the Swede uncharacteristically pulled his shot wide under pressure from  Eder Silveira.<br><br>Celtic were forced to bring Chris Sutton into the  fray rather earlier than planned when Paul Lambert was forced off with  an ankle injury with just over half an hour gone.<br><br>In the second  half Alan Thompson had a fierce drive deflected wide on 70 minutes as  they sought that elusive away goal. It finally came eight minutes later,  when Larsson played a slightly fortunate one-two with Boavista defender  Filipe Anunciacao before finishing clinically from 12 yards.<br><br>The  performance may not necessarily have been vintage and will be overlooked by the Celtic supporters as we prepare for the  trip to Seville, where the team will play Porto in the final on 21 May.<br><br><h3>Retrospective Note</h3><i>  (from CQN website, http://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/?p=12158&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter)<br></i><br>Boavista v Celtic, 24 April 2003, was one of the most frustrating games of football I&rsquo;ve sat through. Needing to score, for 78 minutes Celtic were moribund; they made not a single attempt on goal. Instead, they did what most teams do away from home, condensed midfield and defended, while Boavista, who would qualify for the Uefa Cup final if the game ended goalless, did much the same.<br><br>The goal appeared to take place in slow motion. Henrik Larsson moved forward to the end of the D and tried to pass to John Hartson, but a defender intercepted. Unfortunately for Boavista the ball was returned from the interception to an unmarked Larsson on the edge of the box.<br><br>It spun from his preferred right foot onto his left but the shot gently arced inches away from the goalkeeper&rsquo;s grasp. The goal was a deflection, although we didn&rsquo;t see it at the time. The keeper was moving his weight from right to left as the ball drifted to his left.<br><br>It may have been a turgid game of football decided by a deflection but it was also one of the most intense sporting occasions in our 125 year history. The sheer release of tension when the goal went in was incredible. 15 minutes, and one generous refereeing decision later, Celtic were in a European final.<br><br>Since then we have become accustomed to our position as a credible European team but it was very different in season 2002-03. This was the first Christmas Celtic were in Europe since 1979; each milestone along the way, Blackburn Rovers (a far more credible team at the time), Celta Vigo, Stuttgart and Liverpool, was celebrated with something close to astonishment.<br><br>The triumphs of this season, qualifying for the Champions League group stage instead of losing to Basel, then progressing to the knock out rounds, are greater than the achievements of April 2003, but they will never feel that way. <br><br>That game, that season, trophy-less though it was, changed our entire landscape.

What a truly historic night for Glasgow Celtic and the  supporters of this grand old team. From bars in Brooklyn to pubs in Port  Elizabeth, hundreds of thousands of delirious Tims will have spent the  post match hours dancing and singing and laughing and crying. &ldquo;Oh ya  beauty&rdquo;, they hail in Glasgow, Dublin, Sydney and San Francisco. <br><br>And  now from the four corners of the globe the travel agents are being  urged to book up flights and hotels for a &ldquo;wee trip&rdquo; to the sunny  streets of Seville. Sombreros and Sangria. What many thought to be a  pipe dream is now a &ldquo;moment of a lifetime&rdquo; reality for the team and  those supporters. Savour these feelings of delirium because at this  moment it doesn&rsquo;t get any better than this. Think on that this will be  with you in 15, 20, and 25 years time. You&rsquo;ll be telling future  generations of Celtic supporters about this momentous occasion in the  club&rsquo;s history.<br><br>On a night when Celtic had it all to do they came  up with a performance which managed to wrestle with, and overcome, the  huge weight of expectation on their shoulders. Last night almost  encapsulated in 90 minutes the all too often forgotten phenomena that  circles around the relationship between the team and the support of  Celtic. The support has never been in question and the players know this  but in knowing it they want to give their all and last night, being  such a big, big game, their play was weighed down at times by those  nerves. Added to this we saw an incredibly negative Boavista team who  made little attempt to build on the fortune of having scored an away  goal in the first leg at Celtic Park. It is a testimony to the  professionalism and passion of the Celtic players that they fought  through all these factors and more and provided the support with yet  another glittering opportunity on the highest European football stage. A  wonderful goal by Henrik Larsson with the game entering its final  passage ensured that we all have so much to smile about. More on this  later. <br><br>But before pressing on with the details of the match we  must propose the inevitable question, &ldquo;we can beat Porto, can&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;  Enough! Let&rsquo;s pick through the bones of the match.<br><br>The match  itself was never going to be a classic given what was at stake. Boavista  had already given strong pre match hints, via their previous matches,  that they lacked imagination and the will to play games in an open  manner. On the night they more than lived up to this tag with a  performance which oscillated between highly speculative long range  shooting and spoiling tactics designed to frustrate the Celtic players  and deny them a goal.<br><br>The match kicked off in the Estadio Do  Besso which currently represents only a half built arena. The restricted  attendance, packed on either side of the pitch, gave the players a huge  ovation as Boavista got the game underway. The Celtic line up was  pretty much as predicted and although Chris Sutton had recovered  sufficiently from the broken wrist he suffered in March he was kept on  the bench. <br><br>The early play gave a strong hint that Boavista were  seemingly content to sit on the away goal they had been gifted at Celtic  Park. Celtic&rsquo;s play on the other hand looked assured and confident and  the first 15 minutes saw them with the majority of the possession  without creating any clear cut chances. We saw in this first period that  the Russian referee was not going to clamp down on the gamesmanship  being displayed by the Boavista players. He was seemingly content with  allowing Boavista players to stay down after the most innocuous  challenges, all designed to eat up precious playing time.<br><br>As the  game progressed Paul Lambert took a nasty knock after a challenge with  Silva. The fact that Silva rolled around the floor whilst Lambert tried  to regain his feet summed up the feigning injury antics of the Boa  players. The challenge inflicted on Lambert was to be his undoing whilst  Silva showed no after effects for the remaining time he was on the  field.<br><br>Celtic pushed and probed their way through the opening  half hour and you felt that a goal may come but the final ball in often  lacked the quality required. Surprisingly, at some of the set play free  kicks which Celtic were awarded they failed to cause too much of a stir  in the Boa penalty box. However whilst Celtic&rsquo;s final third play was  failing to click it was evident that the Boa team were uninspiring in  every way. This was summed up in the 21st minute when Pedrosa, playing a  sweeper *** man marking role on Hartson, fired a free kick from 40  yards high and wide of the Celtic goal. A desperately unimaginative  piece of play from the Portuguese.<br><br>Just past the half hour mark  the earlier challenge on Lambert took its toll and he was replaced by  Chris Sutton. Lambert had harried and cajoled the midfield in this  opening period and it was hoped that Sutton would start to gain the  upper hand in and around the Boa penalty box. Indeed as the game  approached half time Sutton appeared to be held in the box as a free  kick was played in to him. The referee chose to ignore the incident  although it may have been harsh if he had awarded a penalty.<br><br>The  game petered towards half time and a good save by Douglas from a Pedrosa  header was the only notable goalmouth chance prior to the break.<br><br>Half  time and a chance to assess the first 45 minutes before embarking on  the final hurdle. Celtic had looked easily the better team but a  combination of stop start refereeing, thanks to the Boa players, had  combined with an unusually ineffectual final ball in from Celtic. This  kind of 45 minutes is strange in that it boosts your confidence enough  to think that Celtic can go and win the game but this is mixed with the  thought that it might just not be their night. All adds to the nerves  and tension.<br><br>Celtic kicked off the second half and the game  itself moved into a frustrating period of play. Celtic, as in the first  half, were eager and hard working but inevitably the negative tactics of  Boavista and the enormity of the occasion produced a nervy and tense  display from Celtic. A period of niggly fouls and more play acting from  the home side culminated in neither side being able to hold onto the  ball and put some passing moves together.<br><br>To their credit Celtic  kept plugging away and you could feel the thousands of supporters all  over the world willing something to happen. And on the hour mark  disaster nearly struck for Celtic. From a Boavista cross on the right  Rab Douglas was left stretching for a high ball. The palm of his hand  managed to steer the ball directly into the heading path of Silva who  had a clear header at goal as Douglas crashed to the ground. Silva&rsquo;s  header was goalbound but a superb piece of anticipation by Mjallby saw  him goal side of Silva and just managing to get his knee in the way of  Silva&rsquo;s header and deflect it for a corner. Hearts leapt into mouths in  bars and homes all throughout Timdom. Phew that was too close.<br><br>In  a way this close call seemed to lift Celtic and although the play was  still scrappy Celtic managed to find some of the urgency which they&rsquo;d  displayed in the opening quarter of the game. Still lacking in cohesion  they pushed forward and after Silva had been replaced for Boavista  Thompson had a superb drive deflected behind for a corner. Both this  move and an earlier one stemmed from Sutton&rsquo;s increasing involvement in  Celtic&rsquo;s play. Equally Larsson was working harder and harder to try and  exert some pressure on the Boavista defence. He was crudely challenged  on the wing just after the 70 minute mark and although the free kick was  wasted you sensed that Celtic where going to give it their all. This  had been evident from Martin O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s willingness to sacrifice Joos  Valgaeren for Jamie Smith.<br><br>Sometimes in matches you just see  something happen that&rsquo;s different from the pattern of the rest of the  game. Many times during the night a Celtic defender would bring the ball  forward and make the short pass to one of the midfielders or to either  of the wing backs. However on 78 minutes Mjallby in such a position  elected to run forward with the ball into the Boavista half. He played  the ball into the feet of Sutton just around the 25 yard mark. Sutton in  his customary back to goal stance neatly flicked the ball into the run  of Larsson. Larsson&rsquo;s clever swift shift of the ball onto Hartson gave  him time to peel way from the defence into space just inside the box.  Hartson was met by 3 converging defenders all anxious to close down the  rising danger. In doing so one defenders boot slid into play the ball  across the box and straight into the unmarked path of Larsson. As he  turned goalwards the ball came to him on his left foot and as a defender  moved in to close him down he hit a purposeful shot goalwards. A vain  attempt to palm the ball away by the Boavista keeper, Ricardo but there  was no stopping the ball as it flew into the back of the net. Cue  absolute ecstasy, joy, and all the emotional outpouring that you can  imagine. Henrik went ballistic, the players went ballistic, the bench  went ballistic, the Celtic bars in Glasgow, Brooklyn and the four  corners of the globe went ballistic. And I went ballistic. Jumping round  the living like a crazy man. Just how do you describe such an  outpouring of joy, relief, sensation, pride all wrapped up in a micro  period immediately after Henrik&rsquo;s goal. Immense and never to be  forgotten.<br><br>With 10 minutes left the Boavista team attempted to do  what they had not done for the previous 80 minutes and for the whole of  the first leg, that was to attack. But Celtic were in control now and  although there was an endurance of four minutes of stoppage time thanks  to a couple of substitutions the game never looked in any doubt  following the goal.<br><br>And so a mammoth night in Celtic&rsquo;s history  and thousands of supporters living out new experiences as Celtic reached  another European final. A new generation of Tims fully able to embrace  the passions and feelings of previous generations by seeing Celtic  succeed at the highest level.<br><br>In certain circles of Timdom  there&rsquo;s been much pre match talk about the noble art of fishing and  whether it is better to wade into the wide flowing river and cast the  rod for that most elusive but beautiful fish, the salmon. The theory is  that this is a far better challenge and more rewarding fare than  trawling the depths for the every day catch of simple fish.<br><br>Last  night we stood collectively with Martin and the players and we saw the  rod cast over the river. We have the real chance of catching the salmon  and Timdom is &ldquo;leaping&rdquo; with jubilation. 						 						 						 					<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <h3>Boavista 0 - 1 Celtic (agg: 1-2) (<a class="external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2003/apr/24/minutebyminute.sport" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">source</a>)</h3><ul class="article-attributes no-pic"><li class="byline"> 			 								                	        	        	            Barry Glendenning 				</li><li class="publication">           	guardian.co.uk,			 				            Thursday 24 April 2003 00.09 BST	        	                 </li></ul><br><div> 	    Preamble The teams emerge from the  tunnel. Boavista are dressed in a sort of black and white check  chessboard number, while Celtic have opted for their mustard and green  away ensemble. Chris Sutton is on the bench for Celtic, having returned  from injury after breaking his wrist in mid-March. Celtic have  made it  difficult for themselves tonight, what with Joos Valgaeren&#39;s own goal  and Henrik Larsson&#39;s missed penalty in the first leg at Celtic Park.  However, Boavista are no great shakes (they&#39;ve won seven out of 28  league games so far this season) so the Scottish champions should be  well capable of beating them out the gate. A scoreless draw will see  Boavista through to the final, while a 1-1 draw would result in extra  time and possibly penalties. Any other score will produce a winner.<br><br>1 min:  Valentin Ivanov from Russia blows his shiny whistle and Boavista kick  off playing from right to left. Almost immediately, Alan Thompson gets a  knock on the leg. He&#39;s okay. <br><br>  3 mins: The  early exchanges suggest that Manchester United v Real Madrid this is  not. Both teams are fannying around in midfield, probing like ... eh,  something that probes a lot. A probe, perhaps. Very dull so far, but it  is early doors. <br><br>5 mins: Hartson does his  trademark chest-the-ball-down-hold-it-up-and-then-lay-it-off-to-someone  on the edge of the box. By the time I&#39;ve inserted all those hyphens, the  ball has been cleared and I&#39;ve forgotten who he laid it off to.<br>   7 mins:  Celtic are having the better of things so far, but judging by the  quality of play that&#39;s like saying they&#39;re the tallest Pygmies in the  village. <br><br>8 mins: A long ball into the big  Boavista box finds its way to Larsson on the edge of the small Boavista  box. (Hope that technical terminology isn&#39;t too complex for you. Try to  keep up.) He wriggles his hips like a superfly  pimp at a 70s disco and  snakes his way between Messrs Avalos and Silveira, but doesn&#39;t get  decent contact on the ball. Wide. <br><br>10 mins:  Mjallby wellies a long ball from the edge of his own box to that of the  Boavista box. Hartson leaps to attempt a knock-down but it&#39;s too high. <br><br>   11 mins:  Hartson wins a free-kick after a Boavista defender, identity unknown,  attempts to rip the shirt off his back. Doesn&#39;t the Boavista player  realise that that shirt is the only thing standing between the  Welshman&#39;s enormous gut and an unsuspecting public? It&#39;s before the  watershed after all, so there could be children watching. The free-kick  is taken just inside the Boavista half and floated into the box. Ricardo  rushes from his goal and holds it well. <br><br>14 mins:  &quot;I don&#39;t consider myself lazy but do you think the Guardian could make                          it so this page refreshes automatically for  future matches? Okay, maybe I&#39;m lazy,&quot; says Emmett Williams in New York  City. Yes you are Emmett. You&#39;re lazy as sin. You could have refreshed  the page 10 times in the time it took you to wrtie that whiney email.  Shame on you.<br><br>16 mins: There&#39;s a couple of  minutes of nothingness after Paul Lambert and Elpidio Silva go down in a  heap after clattering into each other. After treatment, they both seem  okay. Celtic win a free-kick which Thompson wellies into the box. Balde  wins the header and nods it down to Petrov, who attempts a shot from the  edge of the area. It&#39;s blocked down. <br><br>18 mins:  Luis Pedrosa concedes a free-kick about 40 yards out from the Boavista  goal for trying to -  there&#39;s really no other way of describing this -  mount John Hartson. And I don&#39;t mean in the taxidermy sense of the word.  Thompson&#39;s delivery into the box is poor and another free-kick in a  good position goes to waste. A goal for either side would really give  this match the kick up the backside it&#39;s crying out for at the moment. <br><br>21 mins:  Boavista win a free-kick a similar distance out at the far end. Pedrosa  goes for goal and hits the ball ridiculously wide. On BBC, Mark  Lawrenson correctly describes his effort as &quot;a bit Hollywood&quot;. <br><br>22 mins:  An ignorant Yank writes: &quot;As an ignorant Yank, I may sound hopelessly  naive, but do Celtic actually have any Scotsmen in their side?&quot; enquires  Tracey Mohr. Don&#39;t worry Tracey, you&#39;re not ignorant or naive. Well, at  least not compared to the queries of some of our other American  correspondents (An example from last night: &quot;Why isn&#39;t soccer better  than the NFL Draft?&quot;). Anyway, to answer your question: there are two  Scotsman on the Celtic team: Rab Douglas (goalkeeper) and Paul Lambert  (midfielder). Also Neil Lennon (Northern Ireland) has red hair, which  sort of makes him Scottish. John Hartson (Wales), on the other hand,  doesn&#39;t have any hair, but the stuff that used to grow out of his head  was red. That lends him a certain air of Scottishness too. Luis Poedrosa  shoots from distance for Boavista. Wide as a ditch. This game is very,  very dull. <br><br>  29 mins: Celtic are definitely  having the better of this all over the field, but still don&#39;t look like  scoring anytime soon. You get the impression that if they could just get  one then the floodgates would open. Why don&#39;t they just pretend they&#39;re  playing Dunfermline?<br><br>31 mins: Paul Lambert goes  off injured and is replaced by Chris Sutton.  Meanwhile, a man called  Daithi has sent me a very long-winded email voicing his irritation over a  misplaced apostrophe (now corrected) on my part. A literary abberation,  I know, but I am trying to type at 100mph here. That must be why I love  it so much when pedantic spods write in to point out my typographical  errors. Get a life man. Go out and meet some girls. And not ones that  live inside your computer monitor! This game is excruciating. It&#39;s like  watching myself play Pro Evolution Soccer II on PlayStation: I win the  ball ... I give it away ... I run like an eejit and eventually win it  back ... then I give it away again.  Incidentally, if there&#39;s anyone at  Nintendo reading this, I&#39;d appreciate lots of free stuff for that  blatant bit of product placement.<br><br>38 mins: Chris Sutton appeals for a penalty after being clambered all over in the Boavista box. The referee is having none of it. <br><br>40 mins:  Erivan goes down like a sack of potatoes under a challenge from Chris  Sutton just outside the Boavista box. Free-kick for the Portuguese.  Celtic&#39;s delivery into the final third is really letting them down  tonight. <br><br>41 mins: In an effort to alleviate the tedium, Danel Reilly has very kindly sent in <a class="external" href="http://www.local6.com/orlpn/news/stories/news-192879220030122-120101.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this</a>.  Apparently it&#39;s a picture of a monkey riding a dog at a rodeo. I  haven&#39;t had time to check it, so I hope that&#39;s all he&#39;s doing. Otherwise  I&#39;ll be sacked for disseminating animal porn. Boavista almost score  after Martelinho pelts down the right wing and crosses. Pedrosa gets his  head to it and brings a smart save out of Rab Douglas. <br><br>45 mins:  Well, hats off to Daniel Reilly, whose dog/monkey maybe-porn present  contrived to freeze my computer for three minutes. Never mind, you  missed nothing. This is a dreadful game. Celtic are by far and away the  better team and will only have themselves to blame if they don&#39;t nick a  goal in the second half and proceed to the final. They should be tonking  this swarthy continental rabble. <br><br>Half-timeHalf-time refreshments:  &quot;If and only if you need a filler, can any of your readers recommend a  decent pizza delivery service in Reading?&quot; enquires Jonathan Hall, the  genius responsible for  GU Football&#39;s <a class="external" href="http://football.guardian.co.uk/Games/Cartoon/0,6278,941145,00.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ormondroyd&#39;s Football Month</a>. <br><br>Half-time pedantry: &quot;&#39;Hartson leaps to attempt a knock-down&#39;  Barry,  I am very disappointed that you were not more descriptive of  Hartson&#39;s leap. It is not like you to miss an opportunity like that.   Did he leap like a salmon?  Like a beached whale? I think we should be  told,&quot; writes Seamus Darby from Tewksbury Massachusetts. Yerra, I&#39;m  tired Seamus. But I&#39;m also intrigued. Are you by any chance the same  Seamus Darby who came on as a substitute in the 1982 All Ireland Gaelic  Football final and scored the injury-time winning goal that won the Sam  Maguire Cup for Offaly, in the process stopping Kerry winning an  unprecedented five-in-a-row? If you are, you&#39;re a prince amongst men.  Even if you&#39;re not, rest assured that you&#39;ll always be welcome in Offaly  with a name like that. <br><br>46 mins: Celtic get the  second half underway. Or was it Boavista? I could scroll down and check  by seeing who got the first half under way, but does anyone really  care? <br><br>47 mins: Hartson attempts to release  Larsson with a header into the box, but it&#39;s too close to the goalkeeper  and Ricardo gets down to smother it. <br><br>  48 mins:  Celtic&#39;s players must have something better to do on the night of the  Uefa Cup final, because they&#39;re making no huge effort to win this match.  &quot;Barry, how come there is no picture today?&quot; enquires Paul McDevitt, in  Toronto. Okay Paul, just for you, here&#39;s a nice picture of a Mountie.  Never let it be said that there&#39;s no place for lazy national stereotypes  on this site. <br><br>  51 mins: A through-ball from a  Boavista midfielder finds it&#39;s way to Valgaeren who beats Santos to the  ball just outside the Celtic box. He passes to Thompson who makes a  hash of his clearance. Like a wedding where too much drink has been  taken and the bride&#39;s just found out that the groom&#39;s been sleeping with  her sister, this is getting very messy. <br><br>53 mins:  Valgaeren gives the ball away in midfield, wins it back and then gives  it away again. Throw another couple of sisters, a drunk uncle and a  bridesmaid or two into the scenario above and you&#39;ll have some idea of  what this match is like. John Hartson is going berserk with his  team-mates over the poor quality of delivery he&#39;s getting. it&#39;s fair to  say that he&#39;s one beast you don&#39;t want to rile. <br><br>56 mins:  &quot;Barry, your text commentary always amuses me: perhaps we can be  friends and share some really good times together. Just let me know,&quot;  writes a man we will call Joe M, for that is his name. Eh, Joe, it&#39;s  very kind of you to say that, but I&#39;m afraid I have enough friends. I&#39;ll  put you on my waiting list and get back to you if any of them die. Now,  will somebody PLEASE score a goal. <br><br>58 mins:  Elpidio Silvo misses the best chance of the match by far. After Rab  Douglas had tipped away a cross from the right, he dived and connected  with the ball, but his header went wide of Johan Mjallby&#39;s leg. A  dreadful miss and a big, big let-off for Celtic. <br><br>61 mins:  Joos Valgaeren gets booked. As is customary in such situations, I have  no idea why. After 60 minutes, Celtic have had one shot on goal. One!  And you can take it from me, Boavista are no Real Madrid. <br><br>63 mins:  Kerryman Philip Healey writes, while I hang my head in shame at a  shocking error (now corrected) in my half-time pedantry section: &quot;The  Sam McCarthy Cup?  What about the Jules Ryan Cup or the prestigious  Charity Badge?  I suppose being from Offaly you wouldn&#39;t have much  contact with the ole Sam Maguire, so don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; What  can I tell ya Philip - it was a typographical error.! It is, of course,  the Sam Maguire Cup. Now come on Celtic - let&#39;s see if you can&#39;t win  this semi-final and book your berth in the 2003 Worthington Cup final. <br><br>  67 mins:  Petrov pelts down the right flank and attempts a cross. There&#39;s nobody  in a Celtic shirt anywhere near him. Hopeless. Luiz Claudio comes on for  Boavista, replacing Elpidio Silva. That&#39;s a great idea. Take off the  only player on the field that&#39;s given the impression he knows what a  goal is. <br><br>69 mins: Martelinho crosses from  the right, but Rab Douglas claims well. He throws it out and Sutton is  fouled by Anunciacao. The delivery into the box is good and Boavista&#39;s  defenders panic. After pinging around the box briefly, the ball rolls in  the direction of Thompson who shoots well. His effort is deflected over  the bar for a corner which Boavista clear. <br><br>72 mins:  &quot;Why do you give John Hartson such a hard time always?&quot; enquires Tony  Gibson. &quot;It&#39;s not his fault  that he is a horizontally, facially and  folically challenged.&quot; I&#39;ll have to beg to differ with you there Tony. I  think Mr Hartson&#39;s pretty good ... for a horizontally, facially and  folically challenged bloke. He&#39;s certainly some man to trap a ball on  his chest. Larsson is fouled on the left wing and Petrov&#39;s free-kick is  woeful. Celtic have 15 minutes to redeem themselves, but the way they&#39;re  playing at the moment I&#39;d say they could keep going until midnight and  still not get a sniff of a goal. <br><br>76 mins: Duda  ambles up the left wing for Boavista. He gives the ball away. Celtic  counter. They give the ball away. Usually when you type things in short  sentences like that, it makes them sound exciting. But this. Is. The  exception. To the. Rule. <br><br>  80 mins: GOAL! Boavista 0 - 1 Celtic (Agg:1-2)  My anti-Nostradamus qualities come to Celtic&#39;s rescue. Having given up  on his team-mates, Henrik Larsson - who else? - makes and scores one  himself. A surge into the Boavista box took him between two statuesque  defenders and he thumped the ball past Ricardo, who flapped at it as it  went past him into the net. A good strike, but a soft goal from a  Boavista point of view. One of the defenders should have put a stop to  Larsson&#39;s gallop, and the goalkeeper should have kept it out if he  didn&#39;t have rubber wrists. <br><br>  81 mins: As things  stand, Celtic will be meeting Porto in the final in Seville in May. They  are holding Lazio in Rome after tonking them in the first leg. Yuri  replaces Pedrosa on the   Boavista team. <br><br>85 mins:  Johan Mjallby concedes a free on the left hand side of the Celtic box.  It&#39;s swung in and Rab Douglas punches clear instead of catching it.  Meanwhile, Brian Potter, who may or may not be the same Brian Potter who  owns the Phoenix Club in Peter Kay&#39;s excellent Phoenix Nights has  written in to tell me that he &quot;often cycles down Glendenning Ave on my way to work these days.&quot; By way of evidence, he includes a map. Once again, I hope it isn&#39;t porn - bestial or otherwise. <br><br>89 mins:  Agathe hoofs a clearance into the stand. With a minute to go, both  teams have finally woken up. There will be four minutes of injury time. <br><br>91 mins:  Boavista launch an aeriel assault on the Celtic box, but their long  balls are meat and drink to the big men that comprise the Scottish  side&#39;s defence. <br><br>    93 mins: Thompson thumps  the ball the length of the field to nobody in particular and wastes a  few extra seconds. Boavista counter. Luiz Claudio wastes Boavista&#39;s last  chance by scuffing the ball over the bar. <br><br>  Full time:  Celtic have made their first European final for 33 years by the skin of  their teeth. they will face Porto in Seville in May. Meanwhile, this  from a disgruntled reader: &quot;I&#39;ve been fired from work and strongly  suspect that my  internet/email abuse may have a lot to do with it,&quot;  writes Ian Edgar, getting in one last bit of email and Internet abuse  before he clears his desk. Boavista fan Evanio Colberto has a  question:  &quot;I&#39;m confused,&quot; he says, seemingly oblivious to the fact that  so is everyone else who reads these match reports. &quot;I can undestand why  a Celtic play football in Scotland, but who are these Rangers? I&#39;ve  never heard of them. Are they like the Scottish  equivalent of the  Mounties? Forgive me.&quot; Well Evanio, how long have you got?  Rangers are not like the Mounties, although a lot of their fans wear  hats. Bowler hats, to be precise. They are in fact a football team from  Glasgow, just like Celtic. Except with less trophies. Actually, now that  I think of it, the light-sabre wielding business man in the ad at the  top of this report looks like a thin Rangers fan. Right, that&#39;s  me done. Thanks for your time and your mails - a few more of which may  find their way onto this report by close of business tonight. all the  best - BG<br><br>  Post-match row &quot;In  case you never noticed,there were only three Englishmen in the  Manchester United starting lineup against Real and only one of them was  Anglo Saxon,&quot; writes Jim Geddes, who I&#39;m thinking is referring to my  answer to Tracey Mohr&#39;s question in the 22nd minute. &quot;With a population  almost ten times that of Scotland that is pretty sad. In any case if you  knew anything about football you would know that Celtic are an Irish  team.&quot;<br><br>Oh Jim. Aren&#39;t you the parnoid, wrong, angry man? Whatever you might think about Celtic, I can confirm that I  am Irish. I can also confirm that Celtic are a Scottish team that are  based in Glasgow, which is in Scotland. Celtic also play in the Scottish  Premier League which, as the name suggests, is also based in Scotland.  Just because they were founded by an Irish padre does not mean that they  are Irish, even if they do have huge Irish support. Manchester United  have huge Irish support, but you don&#39;t see David Beckham wearing a green  felt hat, gnawing on a potato and waving a long knobbly stick in the  air. Finally, I was not criticising Celtic for having only two Scottish  players in their side. I was merely answering a query from someone who  wanted to know how many Scottish players were playing for them tonight.  And remember Jim, just because you&#39;re paranoid doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re not  all out to get you. <br><br>  More reader ramblings I  have been brainwashed into being a Celtic fan but can someone please  tell me why Rangers fans are called &quot;huns&quot; and  should I hate them as I  do the Green Bay Packers?&quot; - Kathleen Higgins, <br><br>Chicago. (I&#39;ll answer that privately when I&#39;ve got a spare couple of hours, Kathleen! - BG)&quot;Do  us a favour and make a gag up, something about how   Ronaldo was alway  going to destroy Man United as he is used to running  around Rio with a  ball anyway&quot; - Ian Edgar<br><br>&quot;You should have got a  shot of a mountie with a mask.  They are all over the streets of Toronto  now because of SARS. Their   horses  are making a frightful mess and  are picking fights with the bears and     moose. I am afraid to go home  tonight.&quot; - Niall O&#39;Keefe<br><br> This is Patrick in  Montreal.  I&#39;m following the match while reading up  on                          Vygosty&#39;s views on Cognitive Development.  I&#39;m wondering if  Celtic&#39;s                   earlier      inability to score might not  have been due to some sort of developmental                          lapsus  Henrik Larsson might have experienced in his early childhood.&quot; -  Patrick Culhane<br><br>                      &quot;I think a  picture of John Hartson standing on a scale eating a meat pie would be  more amusing than the mountie.

Goalkeepers.&quot; - Paul McDevitt<br><br> &quot;Rubbish game.  Nice to see the monkey though. It reminds me of the photo                          I have at home of a Indonesian monkeys wearing jockey silks  and strapped on to to  greyhounds in a real race. The trial was  performed in Sydney just after                         the war to see if  the monkeys could steer their mounts from crashing out                          of races at the first bend.

He is feeling better by the<br>day, but it&#39;s a difficult one to gauge at the minute.&quot;<br>Oh yeah?

It could<br>even be described as a defining moment for the 50-something.<br>Leading a side to the final of a European competition less than three years<br>after walking through the front door of Celtic Park would be a remarkable<br>achievement.<br>Bear in mind, O&#39;Neill&#39;s track record in Europe before accepting Dermot<br>Desmond&#39;s offer to succeed John Barnes was anything but meritorious. A<br>couple of attempts to take Leicester beyond the very first rounds were met<br>with abject failure.<br>Now, with what must still be described as limited resources, though much<br>better than he had at Filbert Street, O&#39;Neill can be the first Celtic<br>manager since Jock Stein to lead a Hoops side to a European final.<br>Little wonder this most intense man will tonight reach for the comfort<br>blanket provided by such as Sutton.<br>It is an amazing piece of good timing that, for the very first time this<br>season, O&#39;Neill has every one of his first picks available to him.<br>Indeed, with John Hartson&#39;s rise to prominence since Celtic&#39;s attempt to<br>crack the Champions League last season, the side does not quite pick itself.<br>The need to find the net in Oporto will be the deciding factor, and Sutton<br>is a man who can deliver on the big occasion.<br>O&#39;Neill is supremely confident whichever side he puts out will manufacture<br>goals. This is based on history rather than optimism.<br>He afforded himself a wry smile when he recalled, with just a little bit of<br>dig: &quot;The players were written off after the first leg of the tie against<br>Blackburn away back in October.<br>&quot;But they are still here because of wonderful away performances and scoring<br>goals.<br>&quot;The interesting aspect is that they have turned this around because, in the<br>Champions League, it was the matches away from home and the inability to<br>score away to Rosenborg and Porto which saw criticism levelled at us.<br>&quot;They have put that to rest - they are capable of scoring goals and they<br>have done that throughout this tournament.&quot;<br>Greater even than his confidence in their scoring ability is O&#39;Neill&#39;s<br>belief in his players.<br>His game plan since the day and hour they dumped Liverpool from this very<br>tournament has been to get them to match that belief in themselves.<br>After Anfield, O&#39;Neill became convinced they can now hack it with the big<br>boys. Unusually, he went out of his way to tell that to anyone who would<br>listen as the psychology increased.<br>Any Doubting Thomases still lurking within the dressing room would have to<br>accept conversion if the Holy Grail of reaching the club&#39;s first European<br>final for 33 years is confirmed later today.<br>O&#39;Neill, himself a veteran of two successful European Cup runs - one of<br>which saw him left out of the final by Nottingham Forest manager Brian<br>Clough - knows how the stature of players and the prestige of a club can be<br>lifted by success on the European stage, even if this is not the Champions<br>League.<br>He expects every player to reach out and strain every sinew to get their<br>hands on this opportunity, and any negative thoughts associated with fixture<br>fatigue are dismissed out of hand and mind.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t think the last month has taken a toll on the players,&quot; O&#39;Neill<br>snapped when asked to consider the mental and physical aspect of losing in<br>both domestic cup competitions and failing to make up ground on Rangers in<br>the title race.<br>&quot;This is where you want to be and what you want to be doing. If you are<br>involved in European football in April you can&#39;t ask for much more... Well,<br>you can actually - you can ask to be playing it in May.<br>&quot;If you are in it for the glory, which you should be, it couldn&#39;t be better.<br>So, I don&#39;t think the number of games you have had to play should be a<br>concern.&quot;<br>To further emphasise the point, O&#39;Neill continued: &quot;Many teams set out in<br>this competition. There are only four left, and we have got a chance<br>tonight.<br>&quot;The only thing to do now is don&#39;t talk any more about it - let&#39;s go and try<br>to do something about it.&quot;<br>The gauntlet thrown down to his players is lying on the dressing room floor<br>at the Bessa Stadium.<br>At the other end of the corridor, O&#39;Neill knows the expectation will be even<br>higher, blasted there by the fact city rivals Porto look to already have one<br>foot well inside the door of next month&#39;s final.<br>Imagine, if you will, Rangers leading their semi-final 4-1 after the first<br>leg, and how much extra pressure to be the ones to face them in the final<br>that would place at Celtic&#39;s door.<br>Paradoxically, the fact Boavista are perceived to now be in the<br>driving seat after returning from Glasgow with a 1-1 draw will<br>further strain the nerves.<br>Just to crank it up a further notch, this is their centenary year and every<br>egg has been put in this particular basket.<br>Everyone within the Boavista camp knows it would take their fans another 100<br>years to forgive them if they crack now.<br>They have already had to endure a season of ridiculously poor league<br>results, hard to stomach for people who boasted about their side clinching<br>their first ever title only two seasons ago.<br>The focus has been fully on reaching their first ever European final.<br>Many fans argue they have taken this dismissive attitude towards the<br>domestic fixtures a little too far and point to the fact they are now just<br>six points off bottom spot and face a season without European competition.<br>This &#39;weekend&#39; form has been ignored by the shrewd O&#39;Neill, who knows it is<br>their Thursday shifts which are the true mark of this Boavista side.<br>How he must envy this chance to devote all their attention to the one prize,<br>a luxury not afforded Celtic, who, only a few short weeks ago, were aiming<br>at four trophies and who still intend taking the SPL championship all the<br>way.<br>It is to their credit that Sunday&#39;s much-publicised vital game at Ibrox - or<br>visit to the last chance saloon, if no-one objects to the obvious being<br>stated - is not even flitting across their minds so focused are the players<br>on tonight&#39;s job in hand.<br>It&#39;s quite enough to be going on with, and O&#39;Neill&#39;s final words as his<br>players prepare to take the field could conceivably be: Don&#39;t come out<br>second best to Boavista or the importance of the occasion.<br>Highly strung himself, and sure to be bouncing about the technical area for<br>the entire match, O&#39;Neill accepted: &quot;Players are naturally nervous about<br>games like this.<br>&quot;But I don&#39;t think the tension will overcome them. We know what we have to<br>do, and that is the most important thing.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t think it will be the tension of the situation that will determine<br>the outcome of the game.&quot;<br>So, if the nerve holds, and it should, the scalp of Boavista can be added to<br>the impressive list already assembled, very possibly by a scoreline of 2-1.<br>The dream of a second European trophy for Celtic would then be that<br>penultimate step closer. 						 						 						 					<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>   evening times</h3><br>Celta and Liverpool couldn&#39;t stop us - nor will Boavista<br><br><br>JOHN HARTSON today predicted Celtic are not about to let the poorest side<br>they have faced in any of the last four rounds prevent them from reaching<br>the Uefa Cup Final.<br>The fired-up Welsh striker acknowledges Boavista are a major hurdle to be<br>overcome if the Hoops are to book their place in the Final in Seville on May<br>21. The 1-1 draw from the first leg has given the advantage very much to the<br>Portuguese.<br>But, Hartson and his team-mates are confident they will score tonight, as<br>they have done in each of their previous five away ties.<br>The Welshman has grabbed two of the nine they have hit in second leg ties,<br>including the spectuacular one at Liverpool which sealed their passage to<br>the semi-final.<br>By contrast, Boavista find hitting the back of the net a major problem and<br>their lack of firepower has been at the root of their disastrous season in<br>the league, scoring just 26 goals - two less than they have conceded and<br>fewer than any other team in the Portuguese league.<br>In their Uefa Cup run, Boavista have managed to squeeze through on away<br>goals in two previous rounds against PSG and Hertha Berlin, and needed a<br>penalty shoot-out to defeat Malaga in the quarter-final.<br>All of which should help boost the confidence of Celtic which manager Martin<br>O&#39;Neill insists is already at a healthy level.<br>Hartson reckons they can go into the tie with hopes high for good reason.<br>He said: &quot;The manager has watched the video of the first leg and he told us<br>that we played some really good stuff.<br>&quot;Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t get the breaks or the goals at the right times.&quot;<br>Hartson, who will partner Henrik Larsson in attack tonight, with Chris<br>Sutton set to support them on his return from injury, continued: &quot;Ideally,<br>we&#39;d have preferred to have gone into the second leg with a two or three<br>goal lead.<br>&quot;But, knowing that it is 1-1, we have to pull a result out of the bag.<br>&quot;The bottom line is we know we have to score.<br>&quot;If we don&#39;t, we are out anyway as they have the away goal.&quot;<br>Which Hartson reckons could lead to something of a dilemma for Jaime<br>Pacheco&#39;s side in front of a home crowd which will be full of high<br>expectation.<br>He said: &quot;I don&#39;t know if they will have a go or sit in and think the 0-0<br>draw from Parkhead will be enough.<br>&quot;I&#39;d imagine they would be a bit more positive at home. Their supporters<br>will want to see the beat us and go on to the final.<br>&quot;But, I don&#39;t think they possess the quality Vigo and Liverpool had. That<br>was plain to see in the first leg.<br>&quot;Having said that, they are still a good side. They have beaten some good<br>teams to get to the semi-final and we will have to give them respect.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t really know what their home form is like, but I do know that our<br>away form has been good.<br>&quot;We have scored in every Uefa Cup tie this season so there is no reason why<br>we can&#39;t snatch a couple of goals.&quot;<br>Manager O&#39;Neill is confident they can do just that and Hartson would be<br>happy if everyone took a leaf out of the boss&#39;s book.<br>He said: &quot;The manager really believes in us. He knows what we are capable<br>of. Sometimes, we the players need to believe in ourselves a little bit<br>more.<br>Meanwhile, Boavista have narrowed their pitch ahead of tonight&#39;s game.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <br></div>
