No mean achievement, for the big crowd were treated to a suspiciously offside goal by the visitors, one apiece chalked off for the same reason, a clear-cut penalty claim turned down by Hibs, and some outstanding saves by Jim Herriot.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Throughout, too, there was a veritable feast of very good, very imaginative football from both sides.</font></h3><b><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri" size="4">ON THE RACK</font></font></b>   <br><h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Let&rsquo;s consider first that first half, when Celtic, in general, and Craig in particular were on the rack.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri">Hibs were midfield masters, with Edwards doing an excellent job on the right flank and Pat Stanton rivalling Barry Bucknell as a do-it-yourself man roving here, there and everywhere, with a couple of Celtic players invariably in his wake. </font></font></font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">It soon became obvious that thanks to the prompting of these two, Hibs weren&rsquo;t to settle for putting up the shutters.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <b><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri">Before long, they started throwing a left hook which threatened to bring Celtic to their knees.

He looked offside, but neither the referee nor the far-side linesman thought so. The big fellow crossed from the left for Stanton to come in sledge-fashion and squeeze the ball past Williams. </font></font></font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Herriot hardly had a save to make in the first period, although he did give us all a laugh by heading clear outside his box from Dalglish.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNoSpacing">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Celtic were lucky not to be further behind before the interval when Connelly made a hash of a </font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">pass-back and Williams pulled Gordon down in the box, but there was no spot award given by the ref.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  </h3><b><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><font size="4">TRANSFORMATION</font> </font></font></b>  <br><h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">What a transformation after the turn-over. Hibs fell right out of it, mainly because Edwards didn&rsquo;t reappear and Hazel never contributed as much.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">But there was another very good reason. Jim Craig finally put the shackles on Duncan to the extent that Hay and Dalglish found more room to get going in the middle.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">The homesters got back on an even keel when Hay crossed from the left and Harry Hood raced in to bang home his shot in-off Blackley.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Hibs were pushed back into their corner. Herriot again brought roars of astonishment from the crowd when he kneed away a McNeill lob while standing five yards outside his box!</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">But now it was time for Jim Craig&rsquo;s star to really come out. </font></font></font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Dispossessing Duncan deep in his own half, he galloped up the right wing with two Hibs players in hot pursuit. </font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <b><font color="#000000"><font size="3"><font face="Calibri">Without stopping to ask the time, he smashed over a low dangerous cross which Lennox cutely dummied and Deans tidily despatched behind Herriot.</font></font></font></b></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">That was that. Hibs put in a late flurry, but I felt the one big mistake they had made was not pacing their game properly. </font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">They were peeved right on the bell when the ref chalked off an Arthur Duncan goal for offside, but the stand-side linesman had raised his flag immediately the winger shot.</font></h3>  <h3 class="MsoNormal">  <font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Hibs had tremendous service from Herriot, Schaedler, the whole half-back line, Edwards and Duncan.

That<i> </i>is what must be remembered from a wonderfully satisfying game at Celtic Park, a game or excitement and con&shy;troversy. That they were able to play such modern and speedy football should be of more concern to a club seek&shy;ing status than a referee&#39;s decisions or even two points.</b></div>  <div>  <b><br></b>It was a pity that there should have been two offside decisions to detract from the appreciation of the play. One went in Hibs&#39; favour when Gor&shy;don himself seemed to suggest with hesitation that he thought he was off before he made the pass from which Stanton scored.</div>  <div>  <br>The other one, in injury time, was a bit of a mystery and I could find nobody who saw anything wrong, although it must be said that the linesman had his flag up very early and maybe before the ball broke to Duncan. It is infuriating that such decisions must remain as mysteries.</div>  <div>  <br>Even although Hibs did not have Edwards for the second haIf they still came as near as that hotly-disputed decision in the closing seconds to taking a<i> </i>point from Celtic. When they did have Edwards few would have wanted to bet, after Hibs scored, that Celtic would take any points at all.</div>  <div>  <br>Strangely, in that early period Hibs were outspeeding Celtic by the way they moved the ball. It was being flicked about with first-time passes and this was possible because there were always ample running targets for the pass. This<i> </i>Hibs&#39; strength showed in midfield.</div>  <div>  <br>Stanton the industrious one was ever on the move linking the play in a dependable sort of way. Beside him the cunning Edwards dummied and shuffled and sent away penetrating<i> </i>passes while Cropley, at last showing a return to form, darted with dis&shy;concerting speed and at times had Celtic defenders flat-footed and bemused.</div>  <div>  <br>It was all most impressive and when that fine back, Brownlie, began to prance forward linking with Edwards and sending passes to the head of Gordon there was a great depth and penetration in Hibs play. Stein took appropriate measures. Johnstone was switched to the left wing to keep Brownlie busy.</div>  <div>  <br>Celtic increased their pace to try and find a rhythm; Johnstone could develop no game at all and ran himself into impossible situations. The runners, Deans and Lennox, strained at the collar to break free but Black, who can seldom have played better, and Blackley, coolness itself, had them countered and they could not make a chance far less score.</div>  <div>  <br>Hibs&#39; centre defence was for&shy;midable and only the direct dashes of Hood caused them any trouble. Near half time Celtic found a new higher gear and extra horse power to develop tremendous momentum. They had Hibs packed back into their penalty area but still look&shy;ing composed and dangerous on the break. It was noticed then that Edwards had lost some authority.</div>  <div>  <br>He was unable to play in the second half and was substituted by Hazel, but much quality went out of Hibs&#39; midfield play. There was still slickness in mid-field and same exhilarating play by Cropley and inspiring driving by Stanton but there was no substitute for the composure and cunning of Edwards or for the accuracy and unpredictability of his passes.</div>  <div>  <br>Hibs, in the second half, were holding on while the Celtic momentum increased and showed signs of knocking them off their game. Stein had made another switch by moving Hay to the other side of the field to use his running power where space had appeared. Hibs were under heavy attack but defending with courage and in good order. It was a heartening test for their defence.</div>  <div>  <br>Hood and Deans got the Celtic goals to give them a victory that was typical for they had to call on the strength factor more than is normal for them. Their defence was never as well ordered as Hibs and Connelly often put them in trouble with carelessness. It was as well McNeill was in good form. He had a hot handful in Gordon and clearly this skilled player, who is so good in the air, is going to do a good job for Hibs.</div>  <div>  .</div>  <div>  But it was a tremendous game of football, which in the end showed that above all else, Celtic have the will to win championships. Hibs showed they too, are amply endowed with that quality with a great helping of skill and method.</div><img align="bottom" alt="1972 Celtic 2-1 Hibs" height="1059" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/2XTGT_a7uoezXoZvsBnH
