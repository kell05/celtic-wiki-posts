Why Wanyama never started I&#39;ll  never know. Too many lazy, ridiculously average players who want to pass  side to side then launch a 80 yard ball to nobody. No creativity in  midfield. In fact, no midfield at all today. Pish, cowardly weak  defenders that need punted immediately. Ki missing two headers from a  yard out is just a joke. I&#39;m one of his biggest fans but that is just  unacceptable. Total joke. Qualifying for the Champions League? Good luck  with that. <br><br>Cheating hun referee. Nothing new there. Feckin  scandalous decision to award a penalty for that. Totally expected  though. That&#39;s the way it goes in this country. <br><br>Hope fat Craig Beattie pulls his hamstring before the final.  <br><br>McGeouch  should start from here on. Prefer him to Samaras or Commons. One of  them has a joke of a first touch and the other one weighs about 20 stone  and just waddles around the pitch. <br><br>I know people will think I&#39;m  being knee-jerk but not really. I&#39;ve been so unhappy with some of our  players and style of play for ages now and it&#39;s been abundantly clear  for a while now that while getting results, Lenny&#39;s tactics are very  questionable. <br><br>(MMHughes of KDS forum)<br>Yes, we were cheated again. The standard of refereeing in this country  is a joke and it always has been. Jock Stein always used to say if  Celtic are going to win anything in Scotland being better isn&#39;t enough:  you have to be much better than the rest. Unfortunately, that still  stands today. Euan Norris is always going to favour the other team if he  gets a chance. <br><br>Therefore, we need to look at ourselves to make sure we are MUCH better than the rest. A few observations:<br><br>*  Kelvin Wilson is no where near good enough to play for Celtic ( I fear  he may be one that will get Lenny the sack if he stays long term.)<br><br>* Loovens still isn&#39;t good enough (we knew that 5 years ago so why is he still here<br><br>*  Lennon appears very one dimensional as manager ( he sticks to 4-4-2 no  religiously and this rigidness does us no favours at all.<br><br>* Stokes/Hooper have gone totally off the boil for the last few month (motivation or something else)<br><br>* We continue to play high balls up to small strikers- it would help if we had someone over 6 foot in the team.<br><br>* Total lack of width today (when Forrest is out we seem to really struggle in this regard).<br><br>*  We seem to want to play at 2 miles an hour, very slow laboured passing-  we need to play with a much higher tempo especially if teams are going  to sit in on you. <br><br>In the meantime, Celtic &#39;spokespersons&#39; should  continue to highlight the deficiencies in refereeing and ask foreign  refs back, Don&#39;t let Lenny continue to be the one to speak out cause  they will just hammer him. <br><br>CHAMPIONS! 						 						 						 					<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><h3>  Celtic</h3>01 Forster<br>06 Wilson Booked<br>21 Mulgrew Booked<br>22 Loovens<br>23 Lustig (Wanyama - 74&#39;

Black was also penalised for a handball but Norris resisted the temptation to produce a second yellow card.<br><br>Hooper headed wide from a Mulgrew cross, and Webster caused panic when he was short with a return pass to Hearts goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald which allowed Commons in, but the Scotland midfielder&#39;s touch was too heavy as he was forced to go around MacDonald and the opportunity was lost.<br><br>The best chance of the first half came for the dominant Hoops in the final minute but Celtic midfielder Ki Sung-yueng hit the post with a header from Lustig&#39;s cross when it looked as if he must score.<br><br>Beattie replaced Robinson for the start of the second half and the move paid off after just a minute when the big striker helped Skacel fire Hearts ahead.<br><br>After taking a pass from Black 30 yards out, Beattie quickly released Skacel into the box and he rounded Forster before slamming the ball into the roof of the net.<br><br>Stunned Celtic immediately stepped up the tempo and moments later Ki fired over from the edge of the box with a drive which signalled a period of intense Hoops pressure.<br><br>However, Hearts were a threat on the counter. In the 54th minute Skacel fired in a drive from 30 yards which Forster was glad to push round the post for a corner, and moments later the Czech tried his luck from the edge of the box but this time his effort trundled wide.<br><br>Anthony Stokes replaced the ineffective Samaras on the hour mark as Lennon tried plan B but in another Hearts counter-attack Beattie fired wide from 20 yards.<br><br>Ki hit the post again with a header from Commons&#39; free-kick in the 81st minute, before skipper Scott Brown made way for Dylan McGeouch.<br><br>MacDonald produced a fingertip save to stop Commons&#39; free-kick going under the bar before making a great save from Mulgrew&#39;s header with the rebound coming off Stokes&#39;

Was never a pen,&quot; said the midfielder.<br><br>&quot;This sums it up, he thought it hit Victor&#39;s arm.&quot;<br><br>Ledley also posted a photograph of a tackle on himself by Ian Black, suggesting that the Hearts midfielder ought to have been sent off rather than being shown a yellow card.<br><br>Following Beattie&#39;s goal, Celtic claimed for a penalty when the ball struck the body of Hearts defender Andy Webster - and also when Ki Sung-Yeung was challenged by Ryan McGowan.<br><br>Thomson said: &quot;If the referee sees theirs as a penalty then he has to see ours as a penalty.<br><br>&quot;There&#39;s no justice in his decision-making.&quot;<br><br>Celtic had fought back to cancel out Rudi Skacel&#39;s opener through Gary Hooper with three minutes remaining, but the stoppage-time penalty ended their hopes of completing a league and Cup double.<br>Use accessible player and disable flyout menus<br><br>Interview - Celtic coach Alan Thompson<br><br>&quot;Decisions have cost us again,&quot; said Thomson.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s gave one that might have been might not have been and he hasn&#39;t given one that might have been, might not have been.<br><br>&quot;So where&#39;s the consistency there?&quot;<br><br>Thompson praised his own side&#39;s performance.<br><br>&quot;I thought it was a good semi-final,&quot; he said. &quot;The first half didn&#39;t open up because they sat in and got 11 men behind the ball and made it difficult.<br><br>&quot;We had lots of possession without creating too much and then the second half opened up a bit and it was a good game of football.<br><br>&quot;They frustrated us, but we are delighted with the way we played.<br><br>&quot;The lads were excellent. I&#39;m so disappointed for them after the efforts they&#39;ve put in.<br><br>&quot;Hearts have had a couple of long-range shots from outside the box, so they haven&#39;t really hurt us.<br><br>&quot;But we&#39;ve missed chance after chance - Ki&#39;s hit the psot twice with headers.&quot;<br><br>Striker Hooper appeared to adopt a deeper role with Kris Commons moving forward from midfield.<br><br>However, Thompson insisted: &quot;It was the same shape as last week, with a four-man midfield and Hooper and Samaras up front.&quot;<br><br>The first-team coach said defeat had effectively ended Celtic&#39;s season on a low note.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve just lost a semi-final and the chance to finish the season with a cup final to look forward to,&quot; he added.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s the season done and dusted now.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got five league games to go. We&#39;ve already won the championship, so it&#39;s disappointing.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll have to get over this one - it will be a sore one - and then we&#39;ll try to have a good summer and build towards the Champions League qualifiers.&quot;  <br><br><h3>  Live Text Commentary</h3>90:00 +4:31<br><br>The referee ends the match.<br>90:00 +4:14<br><br>Dylan McGeough sends in a cross, save by Jamie MacDonald.<br>90:00 +4:00<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew sends in a cross, Andy Webster manages to make a clearance.<br>90:00 +2:31<br><br>Joe Ledley takes a shot.
