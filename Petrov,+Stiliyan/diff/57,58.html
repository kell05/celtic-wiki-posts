He   was spotted there by PFC CSKA Sofia&rsquo;s legendary scout Dimitar Penev as a   precocious talent, and in 1998 they paid &euro;30,000 for Petrov. After  only  38 league appearances and 3 goals, Celtic paid &pound;2M (&euro;4.5M) for the   young Bulgarian on 29 July 1999 and became Bulgaria&rsquo;s then most   expensive footballing export.<br><br>Signed by John Barnes, Stan Petrov   was to be given the curious accolade of being the only good signing  that  came during the John Barnes era. Taking in that alongside Petrov,   Barnes had signed other such luminaries like Raphael Scheidt and Eyal   Berkovic, you take what you like from the remark, but thankfully he   wasn&#39;t ultimately to be lumped in with them. <br><br>Stan took a big   step personally coming to Celtic, admitting that he knew next to nothing   of the language. Doesn&#39;t help that Glasgow has one of the more unique   English dialects and parochial slangs. In these circumstances, Petrov   wanted to learn fast and picked one of the most curious ways to go about   it. A friend of his owned a burger van, and suggested that Petrov join   him behind the counter and that way he&#39;d pick up fast. Petrov took up   the challenge and the more eagle eyed customers were left bedazzled to   see that they had just been served by one of their team&#39;s new players. <br><br>That   tale may make us chuckle, but it was a perfect education, and even  many  years later after living in Birmingham he&#39;d still kept much of his   Glaswegian accent. He loved Glasgow and it was great to see it  remaining  part of him. The experience of being new to a country was  something he  hadn&#39;t forgotten, and he was one to always help out new  players at  Celtic. For example, Polish player Zurawski noted how much  Petrov helped  him on his arrival having come in similar circumstances.  It definitely  marked Petrov up highly as much as a person as great he  was a  footballer. <br><br>He made his Scottish League debut as a  substitute  against Dundee United in a 2-1 defeat at Tannadice Park on  13 August  1999. He made little impact in his first Scottish season  mainly due to  being unsettled,homesick and played out of position with  John Barnes  playing him at Right Back on occasion. People had actually  given Petrov  little notice at first, the turmoil around the rest of the  club was  overshadowing this high profile signing. It gave Petrov some  time to  settle in.<br><br>Things were to improve dramatically under new  manager  Martin O&#39;Neill, as Celtic won the Scottish Premier League and  both major  domestic cups, and Petov was to play a large part in this.  Transformed  from a defensive player to an attacking central midfield  role, he was to  come to the fore of his game and to the notice of all  the support.<br><br>As  a measure of his value, Petrov was voted 2001  Scottish Premier League  Young Player of the Year, despite a period out the game following breaking his  leg at McDairmid Park in  March. He was back from injury by August, and  was a regular starter in  Celtic&#39;s 2001/02 UEFA Champions League  campaign, with Celtic  retaining the league title the same  year. He was in his prime and Celtic were reaping the benefits  from his midfield ability. Generally a  attacking player, he worked  alongside Lambert, Lennon &amp; Thompson  which formed a cracking  midfield unit each excelling in their own  specialities. Together they  provided the opportunities for Sutton &amp;  Larsson to score the  barrowloads they did.<br><br>It wasn&#39;t just in  Scotland where his value  was appreciated. In 2001, Stan was such a  national hero in Bulgaria  that they broadcast his wedding live on  television.<br><br>Petrov was a  first-team regular again in 2002/03,  scoring 12 goals in 34 league  games and helping the club reach the UEFA  Cup final, where we lost to  FC Porto. Along with most of the squad, he  played his heart out in the  season, and his stature with the fans was  high, and still on the rise. A  difficult game and like all the others he  deserved more. He&#39;d been a  stalwart in the side all season.<br><br>Stan  was simply a phenomenally  good player. He may have been bought whilst  under the much discredited  John Barnes regime, where he started as a  right-back, but under Martin  O&#39;Neill he was moved to midfield and  flourished. An important  component, he was very much at the fore in  attacking formations,  leading by example. He wasn&#39;t a selfish player and  fed passes and  tracked back when required, and many a time can be said  to have been  amongst our most important players during Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s  reign. It  wasn&#39;t just link-up that he excelled at, and he chipped in  with plenty  of goals as well, giving the squad some added firepower. He  truly was  an icon for many. He was overshadowed by players like Larsson,  Sutton  and Lambert but Petrov was no less important to the team. <br><br>As  he  had come through from the nadir under Barnes to the heights under   O&#39;Neill, he was just adored by the support. Must add that he also   relayed his emotions quite clearly. There has unlikely been a player who   could express his emotions as much as he could through his face. Just   flick through a collection of his old match pictures to see. He really   expressed his joy when he scored and his anger when he needed to vent  it  at whoever the victim was.<br><br>The following season (2003-04),   Petrov excelled as Celtic roared to the league title in what was the   greatest season under O&#39;Neill. He scored six goals in 35 games and was   also on target in the Scottish Cup final victory against Dunfermline   capping off a great year which also saw Celtic defeat Barcelona in the UEFA   Cup over two legs to reach the quarter-finals. He was a pivotal player   and no junior now, and led by example.<br><br>In January 2006 Stan   signed a new deal with Celtic committing him to the club until 2010 and   by April he helped Celtic claim their 40th Scottish title. Three months   after signing the contract extension Celtic rejected a written  transfer  request submitted by Petrov, he was then linked with a  transfer to move  to Aston Villa.<br><br>Stilian Petrov said he  hoped that Celtic  would agree to sell him before the transfer window  closes. &quot;Everyone in  Celtic knows the situation, I&#39;ve expressed my  desire to leave many  times,&quot; he said. The next day (August 30) Stilian  Petrov was reunited  with manager Martin O&#39;Neill after completing a move  from Celtic to Aston  Villa on a four-year deal worth &pound;6.5M, a fee  which could rise to &pound;8M in  the future. <br><br>Truth is that at the end  of this time at Celtic,  things had got a bit frayed and he was sulking  at the presentation of  the league trophy, which was sad to see from  him. His loss to the squad  was no easy space to fill. A combative  hard working midfielder like  himself, he gave his all to the team, and  scored some scorchers against  the Huns (for one goal he was even given a  full drink of coca-cola in the  face from a Hun as he celebrated the  goal).<br><br>In many ways, no  surprise he left as after seven years,  as what more could he give? Many  had expected that he was going to  leave after a couple of years, but he  stood with us even after the  disaster of the Barnes era, and under  Martin O&#39;Neill he grew in  stature. For that we respect him, there were  many great moments with  him in the side and he helped play a great part  in some sublime goals  working off of players like Larsson.<br><br>As a  combative box to box  goalscoring midfielder he was not easy to replace,  and he wasn&#39;t  adequately replaced for a number of years.<br><br>  <b>National team</b>  <br>He made his international debut on March 27 1999 against Belgium in a 1-0 win. <br> <br>    Despite appearing over 60 times for his country, in October 2006   Petrov  shocked Bulgarian football by retiring from the national side   aged just  27, promising not to return whilst Hristo Stoichkov managed   the  Bulgarian national team. However, just a few months later, Petrov    patched up his differences with the coach, made himself available for    selection for the Euro 2008 qualifier against Albania and was  re-called.   Too good a player to lose<br><br><b>Post-Celtic<img align="right" alt="stan petrov and son" height="227" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/EpAiIzYhre3wpggSIRWfsA21343/GW414H227" title="stan petrov and son" width="414"><br></b>Stories   abounded in his first year away that he was not enjoying his move and   was looking to come back, but since then he fitted in well and many   would have been happy with that he had settled at Aston Villa. As of   season 2009/2010, manager Martin O&#39;Neill made Stan the first team   captain of Aston Villa, and he was a mainstay in their squad. His   game-style though changed at Villa, becoming more defensive than   attacking which was quite an interesting change for him, coming full   circle having started at Celtic in the defence.<br><br>Sadly, in 2012 he   was diagnosed with Leukaemia, which effectively ended his playing   career, formally retiring in May 2013 although had stopped long before.   It was a sad way to end to his playing days but a more important battle   was to be won and all were behind this great player for support. <br><br>He   had definitely not lost his love for Celtic, and returned on occasions   speaking regularly and warmly on both the club and support.<br><br>As a   mark of respect and assistance for his condition, a benefit match with   proceeds going to charity was held in his honour on 8 Sep 2013 at  Celtic  Park with many luminaries from across football &amp; outside  attending,  <a href="/page/2013-09-08%3A+Celtic+XI+3-5+Stiliyan+XI%2C+Friendly" target="_self"> Celtic XI 3-5 Stiliyan XI</a>.   It was a genuinely emotional match, and Petrov was in tears and so  were  the support. It&#39;s hard to describe the mutual love there is now  between  him and the support, and any silly past indiscretions are swept away.   Watching him on the pitch with his family was special. <br><br>If anyone  wishes  to understand the culture, community and spirit of Celtic, then  there are fewer better to illustrate this than Petrov.<br>   <h3>  </h3>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Quotes</h3>&quot;I   remember when I was a young player at CSKA Sofia and the good life   was  all I was interested in. Celtic came in for me and I moved to   Glasgow,  to another country, to a new world. I didn&#39;t speak the  language  and I  thought it would never happen for me. I knew nobody.  Fortunately, I met  people who helped me to turn my life around. I  came  to know great  teammates who showed me the proper way, the way I had   to be if I was  going to be a serious professional and compete at a high   level. I came  to appreciate so much the opportunity to work with that   level of  professional people because it made me something like them.  At  Celtic  Football Club and at Aston Villa Football Club I was  privileged  to live  a life competing at a high level and playing the  game I love,   supported by the most passionate fans..... Each and every  day I thank  God for giving me the opportunity to still be with my  family.&quot;<br><b>Stan Petrov (2013)<br></b><br>&ldquo;It was a pleasure to play alongside such a great footballer, but, for me, I&rsquo;m even luckier to call him my friend.&quot;<br><b>Neil Lennon (2013)</b><br><br>&quot;At a club like this, it is always important to have players who know the history.&quot;

It was very emotional for my son as well. It was his first   time back since we left Glasgow and he was really excited. He was  taking  pictures and recording things, and we stayed up until 2am  talking about  it. He said to me he wants to move back and live here. He  really loves  it.<br><br><b>You found it difficult to settle in Scotland when you first arrived, didn&rsquo;t you?   </b><br>Yes,   it was very difficult. I was only 19-years-old and I didn&rsquo;t speak a   word of English, nothing at all. It was really difficult understanding   the language, the training, the way of working, the way of being a   professional. But I had great players and team-mates who showed me the   way, and a friend who helped me a lot, teaching me English, especially   parts of the body so that when I was injured I could explain where I was   sore. I had a lot of help on and off the pitch and I realised that if I   wanted to become something, and be a part of this great team, then I&acute;d   have to work harder, get everything right and become a better   professional.    <br><b><br>When did you start to feel like Scotland was home? </b><br>   When I started to speak the language I could be involved in more   conversations with my team-mates and start meeting new people. My wife,   who was my girlfriend at the time, came over here and I started to   settle in more, that&acute;s when I started to feel like it was my home. After   a short time I realised it was going to be a place I would never  forget  and I was right. We still miss Scotland.    <br><br><b>How much of a difference did Martin O&acute;Neill make to your Celtic career?  </b><br>Martin   O&acute;Neill was a guy who would demand a lot from his players. I remember   when he came I was overweight and I wasn&rsquo;t ready for pre-season. He   watched sessions and pulled me aside. He told me straight that I needed   to lose weight, get into shape and get fitter. He said that he saw my   ability to play but he would give me the pre-season to show that I could   do what he wanted of me. I worked really hard in that pre-season and   did everything right, I lost the weight, I started playing well, and a   few months into the season he showed that he trusted me and believed in   me. He was a big part in my development as a player.     The team went   on to win treble that season. <br><br><b>Did that exceed your expectations?   </b><br>That&acute;s   when all the special time started. It was like a rollercoaster with  the  treble and all the great players and characters in the dressing  room.  At that time I couldn&rsquo;t really celebrate the treble because I  broke my  leg and missed the end of the season, but the manager brought  the cup  and my medal round to my house. After the game he said to me I  deserved  to be a part of it and the team were waiting for me. <br><b><br>Where does the Road to Seville and the UEFA Cup final sit in terms of your Celtic highlights?  </b><br>That   was probably the highest point of my time at Celtic. We had an   incredible journey as a team, the fans and the club as a whole. The   build-up to every game was special - then all the wins and celebrations,   it was incredible. Of course, we were disappointed after the final but   that&acute;s the way it goes sometimes in football, sometimes you win,   sometimes you lose.    <br><b><br>Do you have a particular memory from playing at Celtic Park that stands out?  </b><br>The   memories are of every single time I was out there in Celtic Park,   having the support of 60,000 fans and having the privilege to play with   all of these players. I played with some great players and great   characters. It was an incredible time.    <br><br><b>And what about a favourite goal?  </b><br>All   the goals stand out. People ask all the time which one I would take  but  I would take them all. Every moment I scored a goal and every  moment I  pulled that shirt on it was a special moment for me. <br><br><b>And finally Stan, do you have a message for the Celtic supporters?  </b><br>I   want to thank you very much. You have always been faithful to this  club  and you have given me unbelievable support. You should keep going  the  way you have been so far because you are a great family. It is a   privilege for every player to play for you.  <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><br><br></div>
