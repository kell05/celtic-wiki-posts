We lost out.... it hurts, but the season seems nothing compared to the threats and disturbing reaction against Lennon by Rangers fans and their sycophants in the media. (see <a href="/page/Controversies+-+Improvised+Explosive+Devices+sent+to+manager+Neil+Lennon+%282011%29" target="_self">link</a>).   <br><br><br>We still had a chance of winning the title at the start of this game, most supporters who arrived in Paradise on this unforgettable day would concede that our chances were slim at very best.<br>The scenes outside the stadium were astonishing, thousands gathered pre match to welcome the team, but more importantly our manager, to Celtic Park. <br>Inside the stadium the reception Neil Lennon got when he walked onto the pitch to oversee the warm up was heartwarming.<br><br>In a change to the norm the teams came out the tunnel not to the Celtic Song, but to Laba Sifre`s `Something inside so strong`.<br>`Today we are ALL Neil Lennon` was the cry from MC David Hamilton.<br><br>After the initial furore calmed the news quickly filtered through from Rugby Park that Rangers had scored within a minute. They soon followed with a further two goals within the space of 6 minutes to put the title out our grasp.<br><br>Initially Celtic Park was a tad surreal, how would we react? 2 years ago we sat and watched a lifeless 0-0 with Hearts to end our title hopes and Gordon Strachans reign as manager. The atmosphere that day was as bland and tepid as any ever experienced at Celtic Park.<br>Today was not going to be a repeat of that.<br><br>As an appreciation of thanks to the team for their efforts this season and as a show of unparraleled solidarity with our manager, the Celtic support decided today was going to be something special after all.<br><br>Despite Rangers cruising to victory at Rugby Park, Celtic Park was rocked to it`s core as the `Thunder` was well and truly brought back.<br>Anthem of the season `I just can`t get enough` had the famous old stadium jumping and the sight of nearly 60,000 supporters doing the Huddle will live long in the memory.<br><br>Amidst the atmosphere in the stands a game was played and we cruised to a comfortable 4-0 victory thanks to goals from Samaras, Hooper, McCourt and  Maloney.<br><br>As Neil Lennon addressed the support at full time he proclaimed<br><br>`This isn`t the end, this is only the beginning............`<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams<br></h3>  <div class="statslist">  <div class="colone">  <h3>  Celtic</h3>  <ul class="teamlist">  <li>  26 Forster   </li><li>  03 Izaguirre (Maloney 46)   </li><li>  05 Majstorovic   </li><li>  12 Wilson   </li><li>  21 Mulgrew   </li><li>  22 Loovens   </li><li>  08 Brown   </li><li>  18 Ki Sung-Yeung   </li><li>  09 Samaras (Juarez 75)   </li><li>  49 Forrest;

They almost caught Celtic cold when the ball broke to Steve Jones in the penalty area but the winger dragged his shot wide. <br>Celtic registered their first effort on seven minutes, with Samaras going through on goal but Hollis did well to turn his powerful drive wide. <br>James Forrest then tried his luck from 20 yards but his effort sailed over the bar. </div>  <div class="bo">  Hollis was called into action again in the 10th minute. Gary Hooper collected a pass from Emilio Izaguire, turned and cracked a fierce strike from 20 yards, but again Hollis was equal to it. <br>Shaun Hutchison wasted a wonderful chance for the visitors 10 minutes later, heading a Tom Hateley corner over from five yards out having beaten Daniel Majstorovic in the air. <br>Gary Hooper then went close for Celtic, driving at the Motherwell defence and turning inside Gavin Gunning but Hollis raced out and spread himself to block the shot. Brown could only put the rebound wide of the post. <br>Hutchison then went close to putting through his own net twice in three minutes. </div>  <div class="bo">  He first headed a Ki Sung-Yeung corner just inches wide of his own goal under pressure from Majstorovic. The defender then cut out a Samaras cross aimed for Hooper, but diverted the ball just over Hollis&#39; crossbar. <br>The home side took the lead on the half hour, and it was no surprise that the lively Hooper was the man to break the stalemate. <br>The ex-Scunthorpe striker turned smartly in the box and saw his initial attempt on goal blocked, but he reacted sharply to stab a finish which Hollis could not keep out despite getting a hand to the ball. </div>  <div class="bo">  Ki was denied twice by the &#39;Well goalkeeper in as many minutes as the debutant continued to keep his side in the match. <br>The second goal did come for Celtic five minutes from half-time however. <br>Samaras fed Charlie Mulgrew on the left-flank and continued his run into the penalty area. Mulgrew played in the Greek striker with a lovely return pass, and Samaras made no mistake with a side-foot finish from eight yards. <br>Samaras went close again on the stroke of half-time, racing onto a Ki pass over the top of the defence and attempting a lob over Hollis, but the keeper magnificently tipped the ball over. <br>Maloney came on at half-time and almost scored within a minute of entering the fray, but he curled his shot just wide of the post. </div>  <div class="bo">  The winger had only to wait another six minutes to get on the score sheet. <br>Maloney picked the ball up and drove into the Motherwell penalty area. He shaped to shoot with his right, but dropped a shoulder to leave two defenders bamboozled and coolly despatched a left-foot finish. <br>With 20 minutes remaining, Celtic added a fourth, and again Maloney was at the heart of it. <br>The former Aston Villa man put a dangerous cross into the penalty area which found Samaras. The Greece international was dispossessed but the ball broke to substitute McCourt who lashed home from eight yards. <br>The remainder of the second-half was reminiscent of a training match with the vistors well beaten and Neil Lennon&#39;s team fully aware that events at Rugby Park meant that the title would not be coming to Parkhead. </div>  <div class="bo">  </div>Story from BBC SPORT:   <br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9484608.stm<br><br>Published: 2011/05/15 13:46:45 GMT<br><br>&copy; BBC 2011<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <div class="matchLiveText collapsible">  <ul>  <li>  Final Result   </li><li>  Full Time   </li><li>  90:00+1:02 The referee blows for the end of the match.   </li><li>  89:55 The referee blows for offside against Esteban Casagolda.

Page last updated at 18:07 GMT, Sunday, 15 May 2011 19:07 UK </h3></div>  <div>  By Keir Murray<br>BBC Scotland Lennon hopes to continue as Celtic boss next season There will be some soul-searching at Celtic Park this summer. <br>Neil Lennon, the club&#39;s manager, has completed his first full Scottish Premier League campaign and has been <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9484609.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kilmarnock 1-5 Rangers">pipped to the title by Rangers</a>. <br>It was a thrilling run-in but one that ended painfully for Celtic, despite <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9484608.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Celtic 4-0 Motherwell ">their last-day 4-0 win over Motherwell</a>.<br>Lennon has led his team to two domestic cup finals this season. <br>They lost the Co-operative Insurance Cup to Rangers in extra-time but they may yet win some silverware by beating the Steelmen in the Scottish Cup final on 21 May.<br>Having addressed the fans, who clearly want him to stay, after the team walked round the pitch to engage in mutual applause, Lennon told BBC Scotland that he aims to stay put.<br>Defeat has not dimmed his ambition or appetite. And, apparently, neither has the shocking series of death threats, touchline arguments, alleged attacks and battles with Scotland&#39;s football authorities.<br>If the 39-year-old from Lurgan in Northern Ireland has his way, he will be Celtic boss next season.<br>&quot;I love the job, I love the players and I have a good family behind me,&quot; said Lennon. <br>&quot;It was disconcerting to have to deal with some of the stuff but hopefully there is a tipping point and hopefully we are past that.<br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a nearly man. I want to bring some silverware to the club.<br>&quot;We have started something that we want to see through. I don&#39;t take it lightly. I&#39;ll speak to the board and if they want me to carry on I will do that.&quot;<br>The question is, will the Celtic board allow him to continue? <br>Last season, Rangers won the championship with three games to spare. Then, as in this season, the team from the south side of Glasgow had a sense of unity and, in Walter Smith, a manager who knew how to get the most out of his players.<br>In March last year, following the departure of Tony Mowbray, Lennon steered a dishevelled group of players through the remaining months of the season.<br>For a flawless set of SPL results, spoiled only by a Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by First Division Ross County, he was rewarded with a rolling 12-month contract at the club for which he had starred as a player.<br>Since then, the board has backed his accumulation of more than a whole team to re-shape a squad to compete for trophies again and attract the fans back to Celtic Park.<br>In players&#39; player of the year Emilio Izaguirre and Israeli midfielder Beram Kayal, Lennon has generally invested his transfer funds wisely.<br>Lennon&#39;s greatest extravagance was the &pound;2.4m purchase of <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8852050.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Hooper completes switch to Celtic">Scunthorpe striker Gary Hooper</a>, who has repaid his boss with 21 goals. <br>Also, to his credit, the manager has reinvigorated Celtic in the same way that Smith did on his return to Ibrox. <br>The fans are again upbeat and players like Mark Wilson and Scott Brown have re-emerged to offer the manager a resoluteness in defence and midfield. <br>In terms of league form, Celtic won 29 of their 38 matches, drawing five and losing four. Their defence has shown that it is the best in the SPL, conceding only 22 goals.<br>It is possible to pore over the nine games where Celtic did not take full points and highlight mistakes or moments of bad luck.<br>But the 3-2 defeat by Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 4 May will be the one that sticks in the mind as the game in which Celtic blew their title hopes.<br>Taking Celtic to two cup finals and losing the league by a point is far from a disgrace. On results alone, Lennon deserves to be in charge next season.<br>But this is Neil Lennon and this is Scotland.<br>For Old Firm players and managers, Glasgow is often described as a goldfish bowl. With Lennon, it resembles a piranha tank.<br>Last week two men appeared in court in connection with parcel bombs that were sent to the Celtic manager, and <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13368945" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Fan in court over Lennon attack">another man was in court</a> in connection with an alleged attack on him at Hearts&#39; Tynecastle Stadium. Celtic chairman John Reid (l) and chief executive Peter Lawwell (r) applaud the team There is something about Lennon that upsets people in Scotland. The most obvious thing, given the nature of the abuse that comes his way, is that it is his religion.<br>That surely plays a part, however unpalatable it is for Scots to admit.<br>There has been another Northern Irish Catholic in charge of Celtic - Martin O&#39;Neill - who came from a similar background to Lennon&#39;s but he was not in danger of drowning in the same depths of venom in his time in Glasgow.<br>If his image away from football is one of a soft-spoken, articulate man, Lennon&#39;s persona as a player and manager is mostly framed by images of him haranguing officials, barking instructions, snarling and contesting decisions.<br>Perhaps it is this combination of religion and outspokenness that upsets.<br>The Scottish Football Association has been kept busy dealing with his post-match comments and touchline antics at Celtic Park, Tynecastle, Tannadice and Ibrox, for example.<br><a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/9415222.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Lennon apologises to Celtic board">Lennon apologised to the Celtic board</a> following his infamous row with Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist.<br>But after that, <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/9206945.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Celtic call for referee to resign">just like when chairman John Reid backed his comments about referee Dougie McDonald</a> for his part in a post-match cover-up about a penalty decision at Tannadice, the board supported their manager.<br>The club&#39;s chief executive Peter Lawwell said of the Lennon-McCoist bust-up: &quot;He&#39;s got to put up with live ammunition going through the post, bomb threats, 24-hour surveillance. It&#39;s a lot to take on.&quot;<br>The board have shown no sign that they are ready to sack Lennon. Although they have yet to table a long-term contract, they seem determined to back their man.<br>If they decided that Lennon&#39;s off-field hassles were distracting him from the job of improving Celtic, who would they seek to replace him?<br>Norwich manager Paul Lambert, Lennon&#39;s friend and former team-mate, told BBC Radio Scotland that some managers would not be willing to move to Celtic, having witnessed the season Lennon has endured.<br>&quot;In years gone by people would have walked over broken glass to get it,&quot; he said of the Celtic job. &quot;Now I&#39;m not so sure because of the lifestyle that goes with it.&quot; <br>Lennon&#39;s agent Martin Reilly cannot see him &quot;diving out the door&quot;. Instead, he said, Lennon &quot;will sit down in the summer with Celtic and the security and go through what is going on&quot;.<br>In all likelihood, Lennon will be in the dugout for season 2011/12.<br>&quot;This isn&#39;t the end, this is the beginning,&quot; a defiant Lennon told supporters after the win over Motherwell.<br>&quot;The reason I took this job was to win silverware. We&#39;re disappointed today but we&#39;ve got one more piece of silver to win.&quot;<br>Next Saturday at Hampden Lennon will have the chance to lead Celtic to the Scottish Cup. <br>We will soon know if a new dawn has broken. </div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <div>  <div class="headline">  <h3>  Celtic 4 - 0 Motherwell: Fans pay tribute to Lennon as Celtic lose out by a point</h3></div>  <div>  </div></div>  <div class="viewarticlepanel">  TheScotsman</div>  <div>  Published Date: 15 May 2011 </div>  <div class="byline">  By DAVID GUNN</div>  <div class="ds-firstpara">  Celtic finished their Clydesdale Bank Scottish Premier League campaign with a comfortable home win over Motherwell but lost out by a point to Old Firm rivals Rangers in the title race.</div><br>Goals by Gary Hooper and Georgios Samaras had the game tied up by the interval but an emphatic Light Blues victory at Kilmarnock made it academic.<br><br>Celtic substitutes Shaun Maloney and Paddy McCourt grabbed further goals to secure an easy victory but it was not enough to prevent the Hoops finishing second to Rangers for the third successive season.<br><br>The game turned in to something of a tribute to Neil Lennon, who has had to endure a wretched first season as permanent Hoops boss.<br><br>James Forrest replaced the suspended Kris Commons for Celtic&#39;s last Clydesdale Bank Premier League game of the season at home to Motherwell.<br><br>It was the only change Neil Lennon made to the Hoops side which beat Hearts 3-0 at Tynecastle on Wednesday night to keep them one point behind Rangers going into the final day.<br><br>Motherwell showed five changes, with manager Stuart McCall refusing to take risks with players ahead of next week&#39;s Scottish Cup final against Celtic at Hampden.<br><br>Goalkeeper Lee Hollis made his debut in goal and in came Gavin Gunning, Ross Forbes, Stuart Carswell and Francis Jeffers.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s title task was clear yet difficult.<br><br>The Parkhead side had to get a better result than the Light Blues could muster at Kilmarnock to win the SPL.<br><br>Lennon, who was attacked by a fan during the win at Tynecastle, was given a terrific reception by a defiant home support.<br><br>However, within a minute of the start some hesitation in the Hoops&#39;

Despite a 4-0 victory for the Hoops, the SPL title didn&rsquo;t return to Paradise, but it was a day when the supporters showed their solidarity with the manager and their support for the team. <br><br>It was a day to be proud of as a Celtic supporter, and Neil Lennon was clearly moved by the atmosphere inside Celtic Park.<br><br>And he declared: &ldquo;For me, this isn&rsquo;t the end. This is just the beginning.&rdquo;<br><br>The Celtic boss also thanked the fans for their support throughout the season.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a great source of comfort and inspiration, not just to me but to my backroom staff, the board, and certainly the players,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is why we love this club. You could see today what the supporters bring. They&rsquo;ve been magnificent all season.<br><br>&ldquo;The reason I took this job on was to win silverware. It&rsquo;s a disappointing day today &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got one more piece of silverware to win and the players will be giving everything to bring back something for their efforts this season.<br><br>&ldquo;We as a club this season have nothing to reproach ourselves for &ndash; the board, the supporters, the players &ndash; they&rsquo;ve dealt with a lot of issues with great dignity. <br><br>&ldquo;The players have played with great panache and style, and tried to entertain all season.
