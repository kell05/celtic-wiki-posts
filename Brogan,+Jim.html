His first appearance was against Falkirk in September 1963 when he played right half at Brockville alongside his brother and winger Frank Brogan.   <br><br>Jim became a stalwart of the Celtic reserve side and could be called upon as a reliable replacement in any of the half back positions. On September 5th 1964 Brogan and John Cushley stood in for the injured regulars Bobby Murdoch and Billy McNeill respectively, and helped Celtic to a memorable, if surprising, 3-1 win on a day of atrocious weather conditions when Charlie Gallagher even contrived to miss a penalty. There was a press backlash afterwards as some scribes felt the aggressive Brogan and Cushley had gone too far with the physicality, especially on the much vaunted Rangers duo of George McLean and Jim Forrest.<br><br>Jim showed great loyalty to Celtic by going back in the reserves for another long period and it was only when John Clark was injured in February of 1968 that Jim was given an extended run in the side and never looked back. Brogan had a great end to the season as Celtic went on a long unbeaten run and won the league at Dunfermline in their last game on April 30th 1968 to give Jim his first winners medal. He was a natural in an aggressive role at sweeper alongside centre-half Billy McNeill.<br><br>Such was Jim&#39;s good form that John Clark was now only used sparingly by Jock Stein. Jim had a great season in 1969/69 when he helped Celtic to another domestic treble and had notable games in the European Cup against Red Star Belgrade and AC Milan. In the Scottish Cup final against Rangers on April 26th 1969 he helped Celtic to fantastic 4-0 victory and stood his ground in a physical encounter notable for many heavy tackles. This was right up Jim&#39;s street as he was well capable of handling himself when the going got tough.<br><br>The 1969/70 season was perhaps Jim&#39;s best for Celtic when the club reached it&#39;s second European Cup Final. He had excellent games against Fiorentina and especially against Leeds when he and McNeill helped to blunt the famed Leeds strike force of Mick Jones and Alan Clarke. Sadly, Celtic went down 2-1 to Feyenoord in the final in Milan, although Brogan played well and it was the creative side of the Celtic team that was found wanting on the night. <br><br>Jim continued to be a regular in Stein&#39;s great Celtic sides of the early 1970&#39;s and was converted to left-back in 1971 after Tommy Gemmell fell from grace and was moved on, allowing the graceful George Connelly to fill in for Jim in the sweeper&#39;s role in defence alongside Billy McNeill. Two of his earliest outings in the number 3 shorts were in the 1971 Scottish Cup final and replay against Rangers when Celtic eventually won 2-1. Jim was up against Willie Henderson on both occasions and twice managed to win his personal battles with Rangers right-wing star. In 1971 he won four caps for Scotland such was his good form and he had the distinction of playing against England at Wembley in a 3-1 defeat on May 22nd 1971.<br><br>Jim continued at left back for the rest of his time with Celtic and although he lacked the pace and flair of Gemmell in attack he helped to stabilise the Celtic defence in a defensive capacity and was a match for any winger in the Scottish League. In 1971/72 he won another League and Cup double and had a hugely enjoyable day in Celtic&#39;s 6-1 thrashing of Hibernian in the 1972 Scottish Cup Final. In Europe that season Celtic reached another European Cup semi final and Brogan was injured in the first leg in the San Siro and missed the return in Glasgow, his place going to the inexperienced 18 year old Pat McCluskey. Celtic agonisingly lost by 5-4 on penalty kicks.<br><br>By the 1972/73 season Jim was one of Stein&#39;s most experienced and trusted men. His experience was put to good use in the spring of 1973 when Rangers pushed Celtic all the way and the 8th consecutive title was only clinched on the last day at Easter Road with a 3-0 win against Hibs in front of 45,000 fans. By the autumn of 1973 only McNeill, Johnstone, Lennox and &#39;Brogie&#39; were still at Parkhead from the old guard of the sixties as Jock Stein went through a successful rejuvenation of the side with the younger element such as McGrain, Connelly, Hay and Dalglish now permanent fixtures in the first team.<br><br>Another League and Cup double came Celtic&#39;s way in the 1973/74 season although the season was spoiled when the thugs of Atletico Madrid came to Glasgow and soiled the name of Spanish football with their rough house tactics. Three Atletico players were sent of that night for vicious and crude challenges and Jim Brogan could be seen &#39;setting about&#39; several Madrid players in the tunnel as the patience of the Celtic players eventually snapped. On a happier note Jim was in the team that won the 9 in a row League championship at Brockville on April 27th 1974 and was in the Celts side that beat Dundee United 3-0 in the 1974 Scottish Cup Final.<br><br>Season 1974/75 was to be Jim&#39;s last with mixed results. He was in his normal left-back position when Celtic blitzed Hibs 6-3 in October 1974 in the League Cup final, although Celtic lost both the Glasgow derbies in the league, results that would ultimately cost them 10 in a row. On September 14th 1974 he was controversially sent off against Rangers at Parkhead with the score at 1-1 and this contributed to Rangers winning the game 2-1. <br><br>By the spring of 1975 he had lost his left back position to Andy Lynch and it was Lynch who got the nod for the Scottish Cup final against Airdrie on May 3rd 1975. By this time it was announced that Jim was being released and Jock Stein made him captain in an emotional last appearance against Rangers in the 1975 Glasgow Cup Final on May 10th. This game was played in part to celebrate Glasgow&#39;s 700th anniversary and finished in a 2-2 draw in front of a crowd of 70,000.<br><br>Jim Brogan was not noted for goalscoring but three goals stand out, and wonderfully they were all winning goals late in the game.<br><br><blockquote>  1. A late winner in the 83rd minute against Aberdeen in October 1969 at Pittodrie when Celtic came from behind to win after Jim had gone up or a corner..<br>2. A late winner in extra time in July 1974 at Dens Park against Dundee in the Drybrough Cup final, a fine shot from the edge of the area in extra time in a 2-1 win.<br>3. However Jim will best be remembered for his dramatic winner against Rangers on January 3rd 1972. With the game at 1-1 and in the 90th minute Harry Hood superbly controlled a ball and lobbed it across goals where Jim stole in to glance the ball past Peter McCloy to give Celtic victory.<br></blockquote><br>Jim spent a year and a half with Coventry City in the English first division between Summer 1975 and Autumn of 1976.

I vividly recall an all too pertinent incident in a game against Dunfermline in the Scottish Cup in January 68, it was one of those days, Celtic threw everything but the kitchen sink at Dunfermline but succumbed to a shock 2-0 defeat (remember Celtic were the reigning European champions). I recall a Dunfermline defender making a desperate clearance and leathering the ball upfield, it caught Jim flush in the face from about 10 yards, Jim shook his head like a sweating horse and immediately chased after the rebound, the whole crowd cheered, it would have poleaxed a lesser mortal.<br> <br> Jim played in a different position to Scott Brown but they were very much caste in the same mould on the football park at any rate. A highly intelligent guy, a qualified accountant, he wasn&#39;t the most cultured footballer but he gave 100% in every game.<br> <br> Desperately sorry that he&#39;s been stricken with the same ailment suffered by my old man, and I have the greatest sympathy for his family.

His first appearance was against Falkirk in September 1963 when he played right half at Brockville alongside his brother and winger Frank Brogan, being one of a select few Celtic players who appeared for the Celts alongside a sibling.<br><br>He showed great loyalty to Celtic by performing in the reserves for a long period and it was only when John Clark was injured in February of 1968 that Jim was given an extended run in the side and never looked back. Brogan had a great end to the season as Celtic went on a long unbeaten run and won the league at Dunfermline in their last game on April 30th 1968 to give Jim his first winners medal. He was a natural in an aggressive role at sweeper alongside centre-half Billy McNeill.<br><br>Jim was noted for his no nonsense attitude and strong tackling. In the Scottish Cup final against Rangers on April 26th 1969 he helped Celtic to fantastic 4-0 victory and stood his ground in a physical encounter notable for many heavy challenges. This was right up Jim&rsquo;s street and he was well capable of handling himself when the going got tough.<br><br>The 1969-70 season was perhaps Jim&rsquo;s best for Celtic, when the club reached its second European Cup Final. He had excellent games against Fiorentina and especially against Leeds when he and McNeill helped to blunt the famed Leeds strike force of Mick Jones and Alan Clarke. Sadly, Celtic went down 2-1 to Feyenoord in the final in Milan, and it&rsquo;s worth noting that Jim picked up an early injury which severely weakened the team on the night.<br><br>Jim continued to be a regular in Stein&rsquo;s great Celtic sides of the early 1970&rsquo;s and was converted to left-back in 1971 after Tommy Gemmell fell from grace and was moved on. Two of his earliest outings in the number 3 shorts were in the 1971 Scottish Cup final and replay against Rangers when Celtic eventually won 2-1. Jim was up against Willie Henderson on both occasions and twice managed to win his personal battles with Rangers right-wing star. In 1971 he won four caps for Scotland, such was his good form, and he had the distinction of playing against England at Wembley in a 3-1 defeat on May 22nd 1971.<br><br>Jim became one of Jock Stein&rsquo;s most experienced and trusted men. This experience was put to good use in the spring of 1973 when Rangers pushed Celtic all the way and the 8th consecutive title was only clinched on the last day at Easter Road with a 3-0 win against Hibs in front of 45,000 fans. By the autumn of 1973 only McNeill, Johnstone, Lennox and &lsquo;Brogie&rsquo; remained at Parkhead from the old guard of the sixties as Jock Stein went through a successful rejuvenation of the side with the younger element such as McGrain, Connelly, Hay and Dalglish now permanent fixtures in the first team.<br><br>Another League and Cup double came Celtic&rsquo;s way in the 1973/74 season although the season was spoiled when the thugs of Atletico Madrid came to Glasgow and soiled the name of Spanish football with their rough house tactics. On a happier note Jim was in the team that won the &lsquo;9 in a row&rsquo; League championship at Brockville on April 27th 1974 and was in the Celts side that beat Dundee United 3-0 in the 1974 Scottish Cup Final.<br><br>Season 1974-75 was to be Jim&rsquo;s last with mixed results. He was in his normal left-back position when Celtic blitzed Hibs 6-3 in October 1974 in the League Cup final, although Celtic lost both the Glasgow derbies in the league, results that would ultimately cost them 10 in a row. On September 14th 1974 he was controversially sent off against Rangers at Parkhead with the score at 1-1 and this contributed greatly to Rangers winning the game 2-1. By the spring of 1975 he had lost his left back position to Andy Lynch and it was Lynch who got the nod for the Scottish Cup final against Airdrie on May 3rd 1975. By this time it was announced that Jim was being released and Jock Stein made him captain in an emotional last appearance against Rangers in the 1975 Glasgow Cup Final on May 10th. This game was played in part to celebrate Glasgow&rsquo;s 700th anniversary and finished in a 2-2 draw in front of a crowd of 70,000.<br><br>Jim Brogan was not noted for goalscoring but he will always be remembered best for one particular goal. Against Rangers on January 3rd 1972, with the game at 1-1 and in the 90th minute, Harry Hood superbly controlled a ball and lobbed it across goal, where Jim stole in to glance the ball past Peter McCloy to give Celtic a highly dramatic victory.<br><br>Jim Brogan won 7 league titles, 4 Scottish Cups and 3 League Cups and will always be remembered as one of Celtic&rsquo;s most successful players. With his whole hearted attitude, determination and great defensive play Jim was an inspiration in Jock Stein&rsquo;s successful sides from 1968-1975. it&rsquo;s worth pointing out that in this modern day, Jim&rsquo;s 12 year&rsquo;s service would entitle him to a lucrative testimonial game.<br><br>For those fans who watched Jim Brogan, they will recall with fondness his courage and determination which was on show every game he played. &lsquo;The Brogie Man&rsquo;, as he was often referred as, was one of the great Celts of a very successful era.<br><br>May Jim Brogan rest in peace and the thoughts and prayers of all Celtic supporters are with his family at this time.<br><br><br><br><h3>Celticfc</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/15001<br>FORMER Celt, Jim Brogan sadly passed away at the age of 74 in the early hours of Monday morning after a long battle against dementia.<br><br>As a player, Jim Brogan is perhaps the definition of &lsquo;unsung hero&rsquo;. He played 341 times for Celtic, scoring nine goals and playing his part in winning 14 honours with the club during a 12-year period. He made his debut as far back as 1963, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1968/69 season that he could be considered a first-team regular.<br><br>He played in the 1970 European Cup final in Milan, which Celtic lost to Feyenoord. He could rightly be considered an integral part of the club&rsquo;s nine-in-a-row success, playing in seven of those nine championship triumphs, while there were four Scottish Cups and three League Cups to boast of.<br><br>He followed in the footsteps of his older brother, Frank, who had joined Celtic in 1960, and the two brothers were in the same team when Jim made his debut for the club.<br><br>Frank did not enjoy the longevity at Celtic that Jim did, and he left in 1964 after making 48 appearances and scoring 17 goals for the club.<br><br>Jim Brogan enjoyed a very successful Celtic career, the reward for hard-work, perseverance and plenty of patience. Although he made a number of appearances in the first team, he had to wait until 1968, and an injury to regular sweeper John Clark, for an extended run in the top-team.<br><br>After that, though, he never looked back. At the end of that season, Brogan collected the first of his many winner&rsquo;s medals when Celtic secured the league championship and then the Scottish Cup, with a fantastic 4-0 victory over Rangers.<br><br>From there on, it was Lisbon Lion, Clark that was used sparingly, as the tough and resolute Brogan formed a formidable partnership with Billy McNeill at the heart of the Celtic defence, which would be the base for a continued domination of Scottish football for years to come.<br><br>As a defender he was someone that relished the physical challenges of the game, such as the memorable European Cup semi-final triumph over Leeds United at Hampden in 1970. And in 1971, his outstanding performances were recognised when he was runner-up to Martin Buchan as the Scottish Player of the Year. <br><br>In 1975, aged 31, and with increasing competition for his place, Jim Brogan eventually left Celtic. Jock Stein handed him the captaincy for his final game, the Glasgow Cup final match against Rangers, on May 10, 1975, which finished 2-2.<br><br>The game also celebrated Glasgow&rsquo;s 800th birthday and both teams shared the trophy.
