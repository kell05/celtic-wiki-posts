In this  article we take a journey through the years and recall some of the best  ones since the inception of the Premier League in 1975. (note: much of this is from St Anthony&#39;s article from CU (see <a class="external" href="http://archive.celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=730&Itemid=124" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>))<br><br> 1975/76 <br> <br> We are sailing, we are sailing<br> Home gain across the sea<br> We are sailing stormy waters<br> To be near you to be free<br> <br> In the summers of 1975 and 1976 Rod Stewart topped the charts for a long  period with this well known number. During this time Celtic fans  adopted it as their anthem and was sung in a &lsquo;walk on&rsquo; style with  scarves held aloft as they sang it. This temporarily replaced &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll  Never Walk Alone&rsquo; but the old favourite returned soon after. It is said  that Rod the Mod&rsquo;s best moment in football was when he visited Parkhead  and heard the Celtic fans sing it. And not bad were they at it too.<br> <br> 1976/77<br> <br> He used to be a Hun but he&rsquo;s alright now<br> Alfie, Alfie<br> He used to be Hun but he&rsquo;s alright now <br> Alfiie, Alfie Conn<br> <br> (Tune: Camptown Races)<br> <br> In March 1977 Scottish football was rocked to the core when ex Rangers  favourite Alfie Conn signed for the Celts. Jock Stein was so concerned  that he discussed the matter with senior pros Kenny Dalglish and Danny  McGrain to ascertain if there would be difficulties in the dressing  room. The answer was there was no problem but the big man did not know  what the reaction of the Celtic support would be. He need not have  worried. As Alfie ran out on a cold midweek fixture against Partick  Thistle the Jungle burst into song and this would be a favourite chant  for Celtic fans during Alfie&rsquo;s say at Celtic. And he scored that night  as well.<br> <br> <br>    1977/78<br> <br> Peter Latchford, Peter Latchford<br> Give us a w-a-a-ve! Give us a w-a-a-ve!!<br> <br> Cue Peter waving to the fans and they respond with:<br> <br> Latchford! Latchford! Or &lsquo;Latchford for England, Latchford for England !&rsquo;<br> <br> This season is remembered for all the wrong reasons. Dalglish&rsquo;s departure, Stein&rsquo;s final year and a season so poor that we did not qualify for Europe for the first time since 1962. The one positive was the consistent performance of goalkeeper Peter Latchford who performed heroics on an almost weekly basis. &lsquo;The Cat&rsquo; had a great rapport with the fans although time can sober the mind and the thought of big Peter replacing Shilton or Clemence in an England jersey is clearly preposterous.<b>1979<br></b>Ten men won the league, tra-la-la-la-la<br><i>Celtic fans celebrate the sensational 4-2 championship decider with a re-writing of the Boney M song &#39;Brown Girl in the rain&#39; </i><br><br><br>1978/79<br> <br> Ten men won the League tra-la-la-la-la<br> Ten men won the league...Tra-la-la-la-la-la&hellip;<br> <br> (Sung to the tune of Boney M&rsquo;s hit &lsquo;Brown Girl in the Ring&rsquo;)<br> <br> On 21rst May 1979 Celtic defeated Rangers 4-2 to win the most dramatic title finish of all time. The fact that they were down to 10 men and 0-1 down at the time has only added to the legend and this song was sung at the end of the game that night in tribute to the team. <br> <br> 1979/80<br> <br> We only need 10 men <br> We only need 10 men, <br> We only need <br> We only need 10 men<br> <br> (Sung to the tune of Mary Hopkins&rsquo; &lsquo;Those were the days my friend&rsquo;)<br> <br> We stick with the 10 men theme with a song that was sung regularly that season given Celtic&rsquo;s poor disciplinary record. On the following occasions Celtic fought back after having a player sent off much to the delight of the support. Nothing wrong with team moral in those days.<br> <br> Aug 1979 Rangers away 2-2 (0-2 down when Aitken ordered off)<br> Sep 1979 Aberdeen away 2-1 (0-1 down when Tommy Burns was sent off after almost halving a young Gordon Strachan in two)<br> Sep 1979 St Mirren home 3-1 (MacDonald sent off)<br> Feb 1980 St Mirren away 3-2 (McAdam sent off at 0-1)<br> <br> 1980/81<br> <br> One Kenny Ashwood, there&rsquo;s only one Kenny Ashwood, one Kenny Ashwood, there&rsquo;s only one Kenny Ashwood!<br> <br> Who in the name of the Good Lord I hear you ask is Kenny Ashwood? On March 8th 1981 during a particularly dull Scottish cup tie against East Stirling the Celtic crowd turned their attention to a particularly small player in East Stirling colours. Out of amusement the Jungle began to cheer the East Stirling players&rsquo; every touch particularly this one wee guy in the number 10 shirt. The programme listed the player as Kenny Ashwood when in fact the wee guy concerned was Bobby McCulley. Ashwood was running around Parkhead totally perplexed to why the Jungle should be chanting his name, meanwhile McCulley became something of a minor celebrity in Scottish football circles afterwards, being named as Scotland&rsquo;s smallest player at 5 feet 2 inches after his Parkhead appearance.<br> <br> 1981/82<br> <br> We&rsquo;ve won the league again, fly the flag, fly the flag&hellip;<br> <br> In the early 1980&rsquo;s British Airways had an advert with a particularly catchy tune with the lyrics &lsquo;Well take more care of you fly the flag, fly the flag&rsquo;, to urge patriotic Brits to use their national passenger carrier before any of those beastly foreign airlines.<br> <br> Celtic had led the league table since the first day in August and so confident where the Celtic fans of winning it around spring time they adopted this song as their own and it can be indeed heard around Parkhead until this day. The irony was that Alex Ferguson&rsquo;s Aberdeen went on a long unbeaten run and almost snatched it from us, only a late flurry of goals against St Mirren in the second half of the final day of the season saved our necks.<br> <br> 1982/83<br> <br> When it&rsquo;s spring again<br> We&rsquo;ll sing again<br> 2-1 in Amsterdam<br> <br> On 29th September 1982 Celtic had their most famous European win in years when they beat Ajax, Johan Cruyff et al, in the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. George McCluskey&rsquo;s last gasp winner became the stuff of legend and for a short while we actually dared to dream that we could win the damned thing again after 16 years.<br> <br> The next game was against Dundee United on October 2nd at a packed Tannadice and the Celtic fans sang this continuously throughout the game. One can only wonder what Max Bygraves would have thought of all this. Celtic blew a two goal lead and it finished 2-2 even though at the time the fans were not that perturbed although it was to prove a costly point dropped when six months later United edged Celts by one point to win their only league title.<br> <br> 1983/84<br> <br> Davie Dodds the elephant man<br> Davie Dodds the elephant man <br> <br> (Sung to the tune of The Piranha&rsquo;s Tom Hark)<br> <br> One of the peculiarities of the old terraces was that fans could congregate and pick on individual players with chanting, sometimes viciously in the cases of Joe Harper and Derek Johnstone, which are not worth repeating. One of the more humourus instances regarded Dundee United striker Davie Dodds. It&rsquo;s fair to say that Davie wasn&rsquo;t really the most attractive looking footballer in his day and when he approached the Jungle to take a corner kick in the 1980&rsquo;s around ten thousand fans could be heard singing the above whilst waving their arm from their nose outwards to imitate an elephant&rsquo;s trunk. It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that Dodds often got the last laugh as his scoring record against us of the years was particularly impressive. <br> <br> 1984/85<br> <br> Feed the Bear<br> Feed the Bear<br> Feed the Bear<br> Feed the Bear, feed the Bear&hellip;!!!<br> <br> This chant had already been popular with Celtic supporters in the 1960&rsquo;s when it was sung in praise of Yogi Bear himself, John Hughes.<br> <br> By the 1980&rsquo;s it had become a favourite again as a new nickname for Roy Aitken, fondly christened &lsquo;The Bear&rsquo;, in praise of his aggressive, hustling playing style. But it was never sang with greater feeling than on the day of the 1985 Scottish cup final against Dundee United when big Roy almost single handedly won the cup with a heroic, energetic last twenty minutes in which David Hay had pushed him forward from defence into midfield to inspire the team to a 2-1 win. This chant was also sung on various occasions when Celtic players had been roughed up and the fans would call for big Roy to take retribution on the culprits concerned.<br> <br> 1985/86<br> <br> Na na na na <br> Na na na na <br> Hey hey hey, <br> Glasgow Celtic<br> <br> This short, simple wee chant was adopted from the Bananarama song of the period which I believe was titled &lsquo;Kiss him goodbye&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s said that the girls were well chuffed when told that Celtic fans had adopted it as at least one of them has Irish origins and presumably has a liking for the club.<br> <br> 1986/87<br> <br> We don&rsquo;t nee your Terry Butcher<br> We don&rsquo;t need your Chris Woods too<br> We don&rsquo;t need your Graham Roberts<br> We don&rsquo;t need your English crew<br> Hey! Souness! Leave that flag alone!<br> <br> (Sung to the tune of Pink Floyd&rsquo;s Brick in the wall)<br> <br> In 1986 Graeme Souness revolutionised Scottish football with his cheque book policy of bringing the English players to Ibrox. We didn&rsquo;t know it at the time but the writing was now on the wall for the old Celtic dynasty of the Kelly&rsquo;s and White&rsquo;s. The above song was sung during Souness&rsquo;s first season when Rangers won their first title in nine years mainly due to their new &lsquo;foreign&rsquo; influx. <br> <br> 1987/88<br> <br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday to you<br> Happy birthday dear Celtic<br> Happy birthday to you<br> <br> At this time Celtic celebrated their centenary and it was not unusual to hear the fans sing this, particularly near the end of this very successful season. A special word must go to the Dunfermline fans on the last day of the season who, although relegated, came to Parkhead with a huge banner stating &ndash; &lsquo;Happy Birthday Celtic PS Jim we&rsquo;ll be back&rsquo;.

I would never have signed Mark McGhee if I had my way, in fact I don&rsquo;t think I would have allowed him to pay at the turnstiles after his theatrics in the 1984 Scottish cup final which led to Roy Aitken&rsquo;s sending off and ultimately, Celtic&rsquo;s defeat that day. But sign he did and after his arrival from Hamburg in November 1985 he hardly kicked a ball for us in three seasons. Perennially injured and when he did play he looked out of shape compared to the Aberdeen version we had suffered at the hands off on so many occasions. Then, in the autumn of 1988, a funny thing happened. McGhee became fit and started to play and was the SPL&rsquo;s top scorer that season. His contract was up at the end of the season and he legged it to Newcastle. Was his new found form good fortune or did he see his chance coming with his contract coming to an end? You tell me.<br> <br> 1989/90<br> <br> Ooooh Mikey, Mikey<br> Mikey, Mikey Mikey<br> Mikey Galloway!<br> <br> Mike Galloway joined Celtic from Hearts with a big reputation for scoring important goals. However Mike&rsquo;s Celtic career suffered with managerial changes and a versatility that done him no favours. Mike was played at full back, centre half and in midfield but never held down a regular place in any position.<br> <br> The one thing Celtic fans knew to expect from Galloway was total commitment and for this reason he was always popular with the supporters. Sadly, a car crash brought an end to his career while he was on loan at Leicester and despite Celtic granting him a testimonial it&rsquo;s fair to say he has had personal problems since them. We wish him well.<br> <br> 1990/91<br> <br> Joe, Joe, super Joe<br> Joe, Joe, super Joe<br> Joe, Joe, super Joe<br> Super Joey Miller<br> <br> In 1987 Celtic signed Joe Miller who was arguably the best prospect in British football. It was an unexpected signing which added to the anticipation that the fans felt, looking forward to seeing him in his best years. Unfortunately Joe never developed into the player we hoped for although he did have his moment particularly in this season when he lashed a wonder goal past Andy Goram in the Hibs goal on a brilliant sunny September afternoon. In this season Joe actually hit double figures in what was his most productive period. However Joe was terribly inconsistent and more often it was average Joe rather than super Joe when he wore the hoops.<br> <br> 1991/92<br> <br> A one, two and a three<br> Cha-cha-cha!<br> It was the dirtiest game you&rsquo;ll ever see<br> Between Glasgow Celtic<br> The champions of Europe <br> And Racing from Argentine<br> <br> I sometimes feel cheated and the reason is this. Around my mid 20&rsquo;s when I was at the peak of my Celtic supporting life the then Celtic team I followed everywhere with undying support happened to be arguably the worst team since the 1940&rsquo;s. These were bleak days. No team, no money, no stadium and no hope. In order to keep their spirits up the fans turned to the past and I recall one freezing cold day at East End Park in January 1992 when the fans went through the full repertoire of old songs, Lisbon, the 7-1 game, the Coronation cup, the lot, but the above song is the one that sticks in my mind most. We had nothing to sing about in the present so it made sense that we sang about the past.<br> <br>&quot;Oh, Lets all laugh at Chelsea, o lets all a Chelsea... &quot;<br>(Sung at Parkhead after we somehow convinced Chelsea to swap Cascarino for Tom Boyd!)<br><br>He&#39;s tall, he&#39;s skinny<br>He&#39;s goin&#39; to Barlinnie<br>Ferguson, Ferguson<br>(aimed at Duncan Ferguson, going to jail after head butting Raith Rovers player)<br><br>Ian Durrant Collection:<br>1) He&#39;s wet, he&#39;s moist,<br>He&#39;s ******* Ally McCoist,<br>Ian Durrant, Ian Durrant...<br><br>2) He&#39;s a pauper, he&#39;s a begger,<br>he&#39;s shuggin John McGregor, <br>Ian Durrant, Ian Durrant.<br><br>3) He&#39;s blue, he&#39;s white<br>He&#39;s absolutely shi*te<br>Ian Durrant, Durrant<br><br> 1992/93<br> <br> Sack the board<br> Sack the board<br> Sack the board<br> Sack the board!!!<br> <br> By the early 1990&rsquo;s the majority of Celtic fans realised they had two battles to win. Before they could even consider taking on a resurgent Rangers they would have to defeat the closed shop of Celtic directors who lacked vision and finance and were only interested in retaining their privileged positions. As Rangers grew from strength to strength the reaction of the fans to the board became more vitriolic with each passing week. As in all good fantasies there is a happy ending. A wee Canadian Prince called Fergus came along and banished the beastly directors into the wilderness. The Prince then set his sights on the destruction of the dark side and the cause of goodness and light prevailed again. But in 1993 it would be a long time in coming.<br> <br> 1993/94<br> <br> Lou, Lou, skip to my Lou<br> Lou, Lou skip to my Lou<br> Lou, Lou skip to my Lou<br> Skip to my Lou Macari<br> <br> I have issues with several players who have left Celtic over the years. When I was young I could never forgive Macari, Hay and Dalglish for departing to England. They all returned in a management capacity, Hay in 1983, Macari in 1993 and Dalglish for a short period in 1999. For the record I would not have had any of them back under any circumstances. It is a disgrace that Danny McGrain who committed his entire playing career to Celtic is today a lowly coach at the club while we ran cap in hand to the above three to bring them back to a location that they couldn&rsquo;t wait to get away from in the first place.<br> <br> Macari&rsquo;s arrival as manger was the most curious one. It was the last throw of the dice from the old board, time was running out for them and they knew it. They gambled that Macari&rsquo;s arrival would buy them time but things were too far on at that stage. Anyone who recalls Macari&rsquo;s departure as a player in 1973 will know that he left under a cloud and happily Fergus moved him on quickly. Pack your bags Luigi, you&rsquo;re leaving. <br> <br> 1994/95<br> <br> We&rsquo;ll meet again<br> Don&rsquo;t know where<br> Don&rsquo;t know when<br> But I know we&rsquo;ll meet again<br> Some sunny day<br> <br> (With apologies to Dame Vera Lynn)<br> <br> In May 1995 Celtic travelled to Tannadice for their last league game of the season. We were more focused on the following week&rsquo;s cup final at Hampden against Airdrie but United had to win as they were desperate to avoid relegation to the First Division. Phil O&rsquo;Donnell scored the only goal of the game early in the second half. The Celtic fans were in party mood and broke into the above humourous song for the last twenty minutes. Tannadice was packed that day and it has to be said the United fans took it all very well. <br> <br> <br>#There&#39;s only two Andy Gorams, Two Andy Gorams....#<br>(Sung at Ibrox after Andy Goram was diagnosed as schizophrenic).<br><br><br><br> 1995/96<br> <br> There&rsquo;s only one Johnny Collins<br> There&rsquo;s only one Johnny Collins<br> He bends the ball<br> Around the wall<br> Walking in a Collins wonderland<br> <br> In 1990 Celtic were about to sign John Collins and Rangers tried to hijack the move by offering him triple the wages Celtic were offering. To his eternal credit John refused and signed for the Celts. Although he never really played in a great Celtic team Johnny Collins is remembered as a great Celtic player. The highlights of his Celtic days were probably the two free kicks he bent round the Rangers wall at Ibrox and this one reflects John&rsquo;s popularity amongst the supporters at this time.<br> <br> 1996/97<br> <br> When the ball&rsquo;s in the air<br> And it&rsquo;s not big Pierre <br> It&rsquo;s Di Canio<br> When the ball&rsquo;s in the net<br> And it&rsquo;s not Jorge Cadete<br> It&rsquo;s Di Canio<br> When it&rsquo;s hit like a bomb<br> And it&rsquo;s not Andy Thom<br> &hellip;It&rsquo;s Di Canio!!!<br> <br> (To the tune of That&rsquo;s Amore)<br> <br> Tommy Burns&rsquo; spell as manager saw the Celtic team take a more cosmopolitan look. He signed an influx of foreigners and gave Celtic a more glamorous look. Of all the signings the most talented and certainly the most controversial was Paolo Di Canio. The fans had a plethora of small chants for Paolo but Paolo was a false prophet and worked his ticket out of Parkhead for a move down south to the mighty Sheffield Wednesday. There was huge disappointment in the Celtic ranks, how ever would we replace him?<br> <br> 1997/98 <br> <br> We shall not<br> We shall not be moved<br> We shall not<br> We shall not be moved<br> Not by the Hearts<br> The Hibs<br> Or the Rangers<br> We shall not be moved<br> <br> <br> An oldie but a goody and this song was a huge favourite all the way during this season when we dared, just dared to hope that we could get our one in a row and prevent their ten in a row. As it was it was a close run thing and went to the final day but always remember we weren&rsquo;t moved that season not by the Hearts, the Hibs or the Rangers.<br> <br> 1998/99<br> <br> Cheerio 10 in a row<br> Cheerio 10 in a row<br> Cheerio 10 in a row<br> Cheerio 10 in a row<br> <br> Not the greatest chant in terms of originality of the lyrics but a popular wee tune nevertheless. On 27th December 1998 Celtic beat Dundee 3-0 at Dens Park on a bitter cold night and Celtic supporters sang this for almost the entire game. Partly out of celebrating the fact that they didn&rsquo;t get 10 and partly to keep warm in the sub zero temperatures.<br> <br> 1999/00<br> <br> You are my Larsson<br> My Henrik Larsson<br> You make me happy<br> When skies are grey<br> No need for Shearer<br> For he was dearer<br> Please don&rsquo;t take<br> My Larsson away<br> <br> Who was that Italian we were trying to replace again? When one door shuts another one opens and in walked the greatest Celt of the modern era. The man, the main man, much loved by the Celtic faithful. In October he had a horrific leg break and we all wondered if he would ever return. On the last day of the season he made his comeback against Dundee United at Parkhead as a substitute on an emotional day for everyone concerned. Henrik was back.<br><br>At Tannadice on Boxing Day (possibly) in MONs first season. <br>Celtic are winning 4-0 with about 3 minutes to go and the announcer comes on:<br>&quot;and today&#39;s sponsors man of the match is ....

In a bar one night we watched a game where a Swedish player with dreadlocks scored a goal and I commented that that fairy wouldn&rsquo;t last five minutes in the SPL. These days if I show any sense if superiority in football matters, she never tires of reminding me on my first impression of Henrik Larsson.<br> <br> This song with slightly blasphemous overtones given it&rsquo;s religious origins, so much so that the late Cardinal Winning was heard to pass favour on it and laugh at anyone who could take offence by it. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine that the great man actually scored 53 goals that season averaging more than a goal a game. Will we see his like again?<br><br>Cheer up Advocaat <br>oh what can it mean<br>To be a sad &quot;Rangers manager&quot; <br>with a ***** football team<br>(Sung at Dick Advocaat, Rangers manager)<br>-<br>Hey heeyy baby <br>ooh aah<br>I wanna knoooow<br>who the &quot;flip&quot; is Flo!<br>(Sung at expensive &pound;10mplus flop Tore Andre Flo!)<br><br>(or indeed any year when our city rivals fail to put any current silverware in &quot;The Blue Room&quot;)<br>To the tune of the Rangers anthem, &quot;Oh the bluebells are blue&quot;<br>#Oh the Blue Room is bare<br>There are no trophies there<br>They don&#39;t need Mr Sheen<br>cos there&#39;s nothing to clean.#<br>(repeat ad inifinitum)<br><br> <br> 2001/02<br> <br> Tell all the Huns you know<br> We&rsquo;re on top of the league <br> And you&rsquo;re no&rsquo;<br> We&rsquo;re 10 points clear <br> And it&rsquo;s no&rsquo; New Year<br> And it&rsquo;s gonnae be two in a row<br> <br> <br> On 29th December 2001 Celtic thrashed Dundee United 4-0 at Tannadice much to the delight of the huge support from Glasgow who sang this song throughout. The game was played on a Saturday evening at 5.30 as an experiment for television which after one season was not repeated. The little General, Advocaat, was facing his Waterloo and he had but a few days left of his reign. Mind you he left by &lsquo;mutual consent&rsquo; in case you didn&rsquo;t know, couldn&rsquo;t have Sir Dave sack a manager, could we ?<br> <br> 2002/03<br> <br> Tell all the Huns you know<br> That we&rsquo;re off to Seville and you&rsquo;re no&rsquo;<br> You&rsquo;ll be watchin&rsquo; the Bill<br> When we&rsquo;re in Seville<br> And it&rsquo;s gonnae be three in a row!<br> <br> The win in Blackburn ; The joy in Vigo of advancing in Europe after Christmas for the first time in 22 years ; Big Johnny&rsquo;s goal at Anfield ; Henrik&rsquo;s winner in Boavista and the realisation that we were going to another European final after a gap of 32 years. What memories. And then there was that game at Ibrox when the beach balls, lilos and sombreros came out in abundance in a show of colour and gaiety never seen before or since in an Old Firm game and the above song was belted out for the duration of that game. So we didn&rsquo;t get 3 in a row, so what. None of us would swap that season for anything other than a different result in the final.<br><br>Bobo&#39;s gonna get ye&#39;, Bobo&#39;s gonn get ye&#39;<br>(helpful advice from the celtic support to opposing players about Bobo Balde&#39;s approaching)<br><br><br>Tell all the Huns you know that we&#39;re going to Seville and they&#39;re no!<br>They&#39;ll be watching The Bill, when we&#39;re in Seville<br>Cos Rangers and Europe don&#39;t go<br><br><a href="/page/Beachball+Sunday" target="_self">Beachball Sunday pics</a><br>(Celtic fans sharing the fun with Rangers (at Ibrox) before we headed off to Spain)<br><br><br>Tell all the Huns you know the San Miguel&#39;s starting to flow<br>They&#39;ll be smashing their tellies while we&#39;re tanning our bellies<br>Cost Rangers and Europe don&#39;t go<br><br><br>One&#39;s called Ronald,<br>One&#39;s called Frank,<br>One plays for Barcelona,<br>The other one&#39;s a w*nk<br><i>Sung after Frank deBoer joined Rangers while his brother was at Barcelona</i><br><br><br>One&#39;s called Ronald,<br>One&#39;s called Frank,<br>One missed a penalty,<br>The other one&#39;s a w*nk<br><i>Sung after Ronald deBoer joined Rangers then missed a penalty in a semi-final defeat to Hibs</i><br><br> <br> 2003/04<br> <br> And they gave us James McGrory and Paul McStay<br> They gave us Johnstone, Tully, Murdoch, Auld and Hay<br> And most of the football greats<br> Have passed through Parkhead&rsquo;s gates<br> To play football The Glasgow Celtic way<br> <br> There are some football songs which make you marvel at their originality and this is one of them. This song actually dates back to the late 70&rsquo;s and was a big favourite at Celtic supporter&rsquo;s rallies through the years but never really took on in the days of the Jungle. Happily the modern day fans have adopted it and it is currently a big hit particularly with the away support.<br><br>Tell all the Gers in pain<br>That we&#39;re heading for sunshine again<br>Though your season is gone<br>The Bill is still on<br>And our beach balls are going back to Spain<br><i>(sung by some fans before returning to Spain to play Barca)</i><br> <br> 2004/05<br> <br> There&rsquo;s only one Johnny Hartson<br> There&rsquo;s only one Johnny Hartson<br> He&rsquo;s got no hair but we don&rsquo;t care<br> Walking in a Hartson wonderland<br> <br> It&rsquo;s hard to believe that John Hartson came within an inch of joining Rangers. After a slow start big bad John went on to become a Celtic legend, scoring in excess of 100 goals in a five year spell. When you think back to the Larsson - Sutton - Hartson triumvirate you remember that we were indeed spoiled for choice for forwards at that time.<br> <br> 2005/06<br> <br> Oh Artur Boruc<br> The holy goalie<br> He hates the Huns<br> He blessed himself at Ibrox <br> And the Huns went off their nut<br> He is the Polish goalie<br> And he sings God bless the Pope<br> <br> Despite his recent lapses Artur Boruc remains one of the most popular Celts of the modern era. Indeed if he left immediately he would still be immortalised as a Celt for his on field heroics over the last four seasons. Three in a row and the last sixteen in the Champions League would not have been even a remote possibility without that big man in goal. Think of the mediocre dross in that position we had to contend with before Boruc and you will discover the reason for his popularity.<br><br>#Paul Le Guens gonna get the sack <br>We&#39;ve won the league before the clocks went back#<br>(29  Oct 2006, Kilmarnock v Celtic/Celtic went 12pts ahead of Rangers after  Rangers drew on the Saturday/Celtic winning on the Sunday, before the  clocks went back 1hour for daylight saving in autumn!)<br><br>&quot;the sky is blue, the grass is green....we&#39;ve won the league by Halloween!&quot;<br>(Oct 2006)<br><br><i>Paul LeGuen?

Definitely the most talented home grown product since Paul McStay, this song is enormously popular as I write this. I firmly believe the best of Aiden McGeady is yet to come (Memo to Gordon Strachan; Try playing him in the centre of the park to see the best of him).<br><br>A fat kid in the front row of the kilmarmock end gets the ball when it  goes out for a celtic throw. Said fat kid holds it out for naylor.  Naylor obviously suspects that fatty is going to either throw the ball  away or throw it at him if he goes for it.
