The name &#39;Miku&#39; is a nickname derived from the Hungarian equivalent of his first name &#39;Miklos&#39;. <br><br></i>Miku is a player who has spent much of his career on loan out to clubs. His record is not exactly stellar but he is an international and at his last club Getafe he had what seemed to be a commendable record of a goal in every four games (he was at a mid table team) and he even scored once against Real Madrid. <br><br>Despite being their top goal scorer in the past season and their prime striker, he was again shipped out on loan and this time to Celtic. Curious for any side to loan out their top scorer but were Celtic to find an undervalued gem or not? The answer was sadly to be the latter.<br><br>Arriving as one of three notable foreign signings at the end of the summer 2012 transfer window, due to his exotic background (i.e. Latin American raised, Eastern European father and Spanish football trained) he seemed to stand out. The Spanish league was in a golden period and with European football a priority for Celtic, as the club was back in the Champions League, Miku was expected to add value to the squad.<br><br>Despite being given ample opportunities, Miku struggled. His work-rate was good, his movement impressive and his skill obvious. Yet, for all that ability his total return was poor! In the SPL, a far weaker league than he had been reared in, his record was simply pathetic. Some quipped that his body language showed he was getting demotivated or losing self-confidence. If he wanted to stay he had to pick up fast and importantly take advantage of what was in front of him. If he couldn&rsquo;t get motivated enough after playing for Celtic in the Champions League in incredible atmospheres, then there is little anyone else can do. <br><br>The high point for him was his place in the 2-1 win over Barcelona in the Champions League. Not necessarily pivotal in the match, but he put in a great shift in a difficult victory, and looked very comfortable holding up the ball in the opposition half. For that the support commend him but then again he wasn&#39;t being pressured to make or score goals, just keep the ball up the field.<br><br>However, in the run of the mill domestic games he was getting nowhere and his value was marginal. As a loan signing he had to realise he had to hit the ground running hard, and as he&rsquo;d been repeatedly on loans in his career, he knew this clearly. Supporters saw glimpses of his talent and thought each time the support should wait and give him another chance, but there&#39;s just so many chances the management can give before they have to stop.<br><br>In fairness, he admitted difficulty in settling into Scotland, granted taking in the culture difference to what he has been used to, but then stated that the support was now seeing the best of him. The embarrassing nil-nil draw with Arbroath in the Scottish Cup showed little of that. He was making the runs in games and maybe the first team weren&#39;t playing to his strengths but he had joined Celtic and not the other way round, so he should have to adapt. Some would argue that his attitude seemed to be wrong and seemed to go in a huff if after his runs that the ball didn&#39;t come to him; a bit overstated but some truth to this.<br><br>Lassad, who came in at the same time, ended up showing him up in the early matches to the surprise of many (although he himself later seemed to be no better). The writing was on the wall, with rumours of talks already in early December to terminate Miku&#39;s loan in January rather than wait to the summer. However, he stayed or Celtic couldn&#39;t shift him (as club tied), and he remained on the books but was noticeably less on the bench let alone the first team. <br><br>He was given token appearances after the January transfer window, and he did apply himself well despite limited game time, a mark of a good professional. Celebrated the title win deservedly as much as anyone on the big day.<br><br>Miku&#39;s move simply wasn&#39;t working out as we expected despite glimpses of his ability. Lesser gifted players were providing more, and it&#39;s an important note about any player that talent alone goes only so far. He was all show with little end-product. Celtic were another notch on his growing line of loan moves, so the problem wasn&#39;t likely Celtic as he was not settling for long anywhere in a first team. Celtic were his sixth team on loan in his short career. Like others, the Celtic staff could see his talent but again a puzzle why he couldn&#39;t sustain success anywhere (although in fairness he did well at one or two lower tier sides in his career). <br><br>Having played and performed well in the great victory over Barcelona, he will definitely be remembered a touch more favourably than other loan players Celtic have had on our books over the years. He won&#39;t be marked down to the same extent as for example Brozek has been. However, it was sadly no great success story at Celtic. <i><br><br></i><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>Since leaving Celtic, Miku continued his nomadic ways with spells in  Qatar, Spain, India, and then Cyprus where he partnered English striker Matt Derbyshire up front for Omonia Nicosia,  who happen to be managed by ex-Ibrox player Henning Berg.<br><br>[...]<br>        <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3"

Is this the  &quot;modus operandi&quot; that man discovers the child and exploring their  environment to learn. However, at 27, Nicholas&#39; Miku &quot;Fedor is such that  the lessons never stop coming through this simple system, a formula  that now allows you to wait with patience and understanding as it passes  through Scotland left behind ... only as &quot;a sad memory.&quot;<br><br>Within  two months, the Venezuelan forward will be on a plane and change the  page and continue his career. When you look out the window and see what  they left behind, not a nostalgic feel. By then, stay at Celtic FC  Glasgow City alone will have been a bitter pill for a year that he  admits &quot;want to remove from your head.&quot;<br><br>Honestly, the  Caracas-born striker admits being wrong on the last decision he made to  his professional side. &quot;It was a mistake to go there (Scotland). Simply  because I can not do anything,&quot; Fedor loose, knowing that even should  remain at the club on loan until end of season Betis. And in August 2012  &#39;Miku&#39; went from being a starter in the Getafe immovable, to be  relegated to the bench at Celtic.<br><br>&quot;At first I did not understand.  I said to myself: &#39;How might come to play in the best league in the  world (Spain) and no part of Scotland?&#39; (...) But then I realized that  things had nothing to do with sports, &quot;says another former Valencia  striker, who was coming off his best season in Getafe (12 goals) and  thought just leave Scotland in December, but FIFA rules were filed.<br><br>The  romance between &#39;Miku&#39; and Celtic started well. From mouth coach, Neil  Lennon, the player was praised for its technical capacity, a fact that  projected a promising outlook. However, playing time came intermittently  and progressively deteriorated the relationship between the player and  the quarterback, until the cloudy mind: &quot;I do not talk. I like to face  the truth. They do not like me say one thing and then do another front  behind. &quot;<br><br>Despite the stabbing had to handle frustration, Nicol&aacute;s  Fedor found tranquility to fully understand your situation. &quot;I know you  are going to play those who are there, who knows coach and they have  more confidence. If there is an injury, I know I can participate,&quot; he  says, and then discuss their current status reminds one of past  experiences: &quot;I liken it a lot with what I experienced in Valencia.  Obviously there playing David Villa and not me, a compelling reason.  addition I was very young and impetuous, so that I could not absorb it.&quot;<br><br>Knowing  that has its days numbered in Scottish Highlands, the Caracas agree  that he would have liked to have continuity in at least five straight.  &quot;The last time I was the owner, after I returned from the concentration  of burgundy in Madrid, got goal. Then spent six league matches without  playing. So what I have to do?;? Being born in Scotland?&quot; jokes.<br><br>In  parallel, the anxieties and concerns have filled the lives of &#39;Miku&#39;  outside engramado. And it is to deal with the unpredictable mild climate  of Scotland, has been beaten to force the health of his daughter  Alessandra Nicole Fedor. &quot;He got sick a lot. Never two weeks we could  have quiet, because we&#39;re at the doctor or something is wrong with her&quot;  details about her little less than a year, who was born in Spain.<br><br>A new horizon<br><br>Whenever  this hurts you, &#39;Miku&#39; is in the burgundy a valuable refuge. &quot;I feel  that morale boost I need sometimes. I feel very loved and well respected  in the selection,&quot; he says. In turn clings to the family, while waiting  to pass the days.<br><br>Already, deck options for the immediate  future. Back to Spain, where he lived the last 12 years, is the  strongest alternative, plus you still have a contract with Getafe.  &quot;There have been some very good things in the Spanish league. Teams are  interested in positions with good European and other places in the  table.&#39;s Goal is to return to the world elite&quot; confirms, preferring not  to forward names before there is a agreement.<br><br>That is why the Venezuelan hungarian descent thank God, because even in December to seven clubs in Spain called it.<br><br>His  stay in Scotland is not over yet, but-without-the end comes &quot;Miku&quot;  Fedor files on its head a new learning for future years of his career:  &quot;I have to make decisions with more sports and more cold head &quot;.

Standing at over 6ft tall, industrious, and with good movement off the ball, Miku had, on paper, all the attributes required to be a hit under Lennon.<br>Listen to JOHN MCCULLAGH with A Celtic State of Mind here:<br><br>Slow Rise to Prominence<br><br>Born in Venezuela to a Hungarian father and raised in Spain, Miku had a unique blend of football influences to call upon, making him a player worth taking notice of. He had also top-scored for Getafe in the season prior to his move to Celtic, hitting the back of the net 12 times in 38 league games; a highly impressive return for a mid-table La Liga side.<br><br>However, by the time Miku ended up at Celtic, he had already turned out for seven different clubs as he was farmed out on loan by parent club Valencia on an annual basis at the start of his career, before eventually signing a permanent contract with Getafe.<br><br>Miku spent his formative years on loan at various lower league clubs in Spain, averaging a goal every 3.5 games as he looked to force his way into the main squad at Valencia. At the start of the 2009/10 season, it looked like he might finally get the break he was looking for, scoring a hat-trick against Stabaek in a Europa League match. As it turned out, those would be his only goals for Los Ches with a move to Getafe confirmed in January 2010.<br><br>With Getafe, Miku was afforded the top-flight, first-team football he was unable to secure at Valencia. He quickly became a mainstay in the team helping them to achieve 6th, 16th, and 11th-placed finishes in his first 2.5 seasons at the club; with a personal highlight of scoring a double at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid in a 4-2 defeat during the 2011/12 season.<br><br>During this stage of his career, Miku began to thrive at International level and was part of the Venezuela squad that achieved a 4th-place finish in the 2011 Copa America, the nation&rsquo;s best ever performance in the tournament.<br><br>The Celtic Year<br><br>Miku&rsquo;s exploits with Getafe and Venezuela had not gone unnoticed and he was on the move once more in 2012, this time the destination was Celtic Park and, at 27 years of age, the striker should have been arriving at the peak of his career.<br><br>First pick at Getafe, Miku hadn&rsquo;t joined Celtic with the intention of playing second fiddle to Gary Hooper, but to be a key part of the team, win silverware for the first time in his career, and taste the Champions League. His intentions were pure enough, and having rejected moves to relegation candidates in the English Premiership to join Celtic instead, he was warmly welcomed by the faithful.<br><br>Miku was given the hallowed number 7 jersey on his arrival, a curse perhaps given the size of the footsteps left behind by previous wearers of that number. As it would transpire throughout the season, Miku could not live up to the expectation that comes with the number 7 jersey at Celtic Park.<br><br>In total, Miku mustered a measly two goals for Celtic, both of which came away from home, at Tannadice and the Tulloch Stadium respectively.<br><br>Fittingly, however, for a man who had spent his entire career in Spain before moving to Glasgow, Miku&rsquo;s finest hour in the Hoops would arrive against Spanish opposition; the Catalan giants, Barcelona.<br><br>On an evening where Celtic celebrated their 125th Anniversary, another fairytale chapter was written in the club&rsquo;s history as the Bhoys saw off Tito Vilanova&rsquo;s irrepressible Barcelona. It was the night that a young Tony Watt wrote himself into Celtic folklore, scoring the winner just 10 minutes after entering the fray.<br><br>For his part, Miku played the full 90 plus minutes and had a subtle, yet important, hand in the opening goal by impeding Valdes&rsquo; movement as Charlie Mulgrew&rsquo;s corner made its way on to the head of Victor Wanyama.<br><br>While Celtic spent most of the game camped in their own half, Miku posed the Barca backline a number of problems with his hold-up play and clever movement on the Hoops&rsquo; rare forays forward.<br><br>But strikers are judged on goals and Miku was finding them to come by. As the season wore on, chances to impress came fewer and further between as the emergence of Tony Watt alongside established frontmen Hooper, Samaras, and Stokes severely restricted Miku&rsquo;s game time.<br><br>The option to sign the South American on a permanent deal at the end of the season was not invoked as Celtic looked elsewhere for their next hitman. For Miku, his time in Paradise was over.<br><br>Life after Celtic<br><br>Since leaving Celtic, Miku has continued his nomadic ways with spells in Qatar, Spain, India, and most recently Cyprus where he currently partners English striker Matt Derbyshire up front for Omonia Nicosia, who happen to be managed by ex-Rangers defender Henning Berg.<br><br><div>At 34, Miku is now in the twilight of his career but he&rsquo;ll always have that glorious night in November 2012 to look back on and the memory that it was Celtic with whom he won his first career silverware; the 2012/13 Scottish Premier League title. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><div></div><br></div></div>
