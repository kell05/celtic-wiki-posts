I hope to see as many as possible.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I&#39;ve  stated several times that my five years at Celtic were the happiest of  my career, while my family loved living in Glasgow. We all miss it.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;The  last six months at the club, between injury and then leaving, weren&#39;t  the best. I left under a bit of a cloud but I can&#39;t say enough good  things about Celtic and we really appreciate the fact they&#39;ve agreed to  pay us a visit.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to seeing Lenny standing in the other dugout.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It&#39;s his first game in Britain since being appointed manager. Celtic will have only just returned from an American tour.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I  see it as a special day - a chance for me to properly say thank you to  the Celtic fans for the fantastic backing they gave me. That was my one  big regret when I left, that it all happened without the chance to bid  farewell and applaud the supporters.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton added: &quot;I was over in Ireland for the weekend as a guest at the annual dinner for the association of Celtic supporters.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I  couldn&#39;t have got a better welcome. It just brought it home again how  good a time it was for me at Celtic. If only I could turn the clock back  to the Martin O&#39;Neill days and the old team was together again, winning  trophies and beating the best in Europe.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It&#39;s true there&#39;s nothing better than playing. I miss everything that goes with it, especially at Celtic.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;As  a player I wanted to win every game and I&#39;m no different as a manager -  despite the limited resources at Lincoln and the odds being against us.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It just makes for a bigger challenge but if Lenny ever wants to swap budgets then I&#39;ll only be too delighted!&quot;</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  Sutton Special</span></h3><font size="2"><span class="diffAdd">(The Sun)  </span><br><span class="diffAdd">By Derek McGregor</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">CHRIS SUTTON worshipped Martin O&#39;Neill when he was a Nottingham Forest legend.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Little  did he know during those childhood days marvelling at Brian Clough&#39;s  side that he would eventually become an idol of O&#39;Neill&#39;s.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The  duo worked their magic for Celtic over an astonishing five years which  saw them put Rangers back in the shade after a decade-long spell of  dominance.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton can&#39;t speak highly enough of O&#39;Neill, and  coaches John Robertson and Steve Walford, for giving him the happiest  times of an illustrious career.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And he dearly hopes he&#39;ll meet up with them again on November 7 at a tribute night organised in his honour by Celtic.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton  - who recently quit his first managerial post at Lincoln City - told  SunSport: &quot;I had other options when Celtic came in for me.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;But  the more I thought about them the more they appealed. I&#39;d heard about  Henrik Larsson while Martin had a very good reputation as a manager.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I was born in Nottingham and because of that I supported Forest as a kid.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Martin, of course, was part of the Brian Clough team.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Now I&#39;m not saying that was the reason I signed for him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;But through watching him as a player,then seeing what he did as a manager, I already had great respect for Martin.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;There  wasn&#39;t a day at Celtic when I didn&#39;t look forward to going in for  training. Martin, Robbo and Wally made sure it was enjoyable while we  had a great dressing rooom.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Martin just treated you like a human being. He wouldn&#39;t treat you badly. That&#39;s what makes him a great manager.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;He  doesn&#39;t talk for the sake of talking. People might have thought he was  being harsh but, again, he has a will to win and knows how to treat  players.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;He wouldn&#39;t lambast everybody, but he wouldn&#39;t cuddle everybody either.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Martin  was fair. Sometimes as a player you just have to be honest with  yourself, if you&#39;ve been poor in training or during a game.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Martin wouldn&#39;t miss you and as far as I was concerned you just had to accept it. Some accepted it better than others.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;But I always thought he was exceptionally fair - and that&#39;s why I liked him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I  think every time we ran out for a game we wanted to do well for him. I  really believe that. Robbo and Wally were brilliant alongside Martin.  They were nice people, but they had the same will to win as the  manager.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton was a tormented figure at Chelsea when O&#39;Neill  swooped to end his hell - and make him the &pound;6million replacement for  Mark Viduka.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The ex-Norwich City, Blackburn and England ace said: &quot;Going to Celtic was like a breath of fresh air for me.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I put pressure on myself to do well after the difficult year I had at Chelsea.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I was nervous and didn&#39;t know what to expect with Martin O&#39;Neill.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I was certainly pleased to leave Chelsea and I&#39;m sure they too were pleased to see the back of me!</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;For whatever reason I didn&#39;t do particularly well at Stamford Bridge.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Some people thought I&#39;d lost what I showed at Blackburn Rovers and Norwich. But I knew I HADN&#39;T.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;It was just a confidence thing. Going to Celtic gave my career the kiss of life.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Martin maximised my strengths and I couldn&#39;t have wished for a more successful spell at a club.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;With  the best will in the world, I was never one of those players who could  dribble past four or five guys and then bang a shot into the top corner.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I  couldn&#39;t do things like Lubo Moravcik did or even Henrik. But there  were other things I could bring to the team - my link-up play and my  strength in the air.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I knew where people were and could read the game OK.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;But I&#39;d never claim to have been the complete footballer.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic, and Glasgow, will always have a special place in Sutton&#39;s heart.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And he added: &quot;I&#39;m proud of what I achieved with Celtic and will be forever grateful for the backing I got from the fans.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;They played a huge part in making the experience of being at Celtic so good.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I didn&#39;t enjoy myself at Chelsea - but I don&#39;t blame anybody else for that.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Honestly, if I had the chance to turn the clock back and live my life again, then I&#39;d have another five years at Celtic.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I really appreciated what I had there and me and the family loved living in Glasgow. We still miss the place.&quot; </span></font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  Chris Sutton: Rangers snubbed me - I made them pay with double in Old Firm debut</span></h3><br><span class="diffAdd">Oct 2 2011 Mark Guidi, Sunday Mail</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Daily Record</span><br><span class="diffAdd">chris sutton</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">CHRIS SUTTON has revealed Rangers turned down the chance to sign him from Chelsea for &pound;6million in summer 2000.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Dick  Advocaat was Ibrox boss at that time but Martin O&rsquo;Neill didn&rsquo;t hesitate  to bring Sutton to Celtic when he took over at Parkhead.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton revealed: &ldquo;I may well have ended up on the other side of the divide as I almost had the chance to sign for Rangers.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;My name was put to the club when I was to leave Chelsea but word came back they weren&rsquo;t interested in me.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton never looked back. Indeed, his most enjoyable moments in football came when he helped Celtic win Old Firm games.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The Parkhead legend came to Scotland in summer 2000 and vowed to end Rangers&rsquo; decade of domestic dominance.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He  managed to do that in his first Old Firm game when he scored twice in a  6-2 win and enjoyed even more successes after that during a five-year  stay in Glasgow&rsquo;s East End.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And he revealed it was easy to stay  motivated from the moment he clapped eyes on Lorenzo Amoruso and found  the big Italian defender simply wound him up the wrong way.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton  said: &ldquo;When I arrived I wanted to put Rangers in their place. I felt  strongly about this. I came to Scotland to be a winner and be  successful.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I had a bad year at Chelsea the previous season and  wasn&rsquo;t ready for another. We beat Rangers 6-2 at Parkhead in my first  Old Firm game. In that match I was up against Lorenzo and Bert  Konterman.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I found Amoruso to be a good motivation. He fancied himself and had a real arrogance about him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;That was like a red rag to a bull for me. I wanted to dominate him, show him who was boss.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I  had it in my mind before that game that I wanted to get on the pitch  and smash him around. Winning personal battles on the pitch was a big  part of my game.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I used to think about how I was going to get  the better of my direct opponent, to out-think, out-muscle and even  out-manoeuvre him. We won and I scored twice.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It was that steely  nature, hunger for the fight and a canny knack of netting against their  bitter rivals that saw Celtic supporters take Sutton to their hearts  within 51 seconds of his debut.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The striker was a big fan of the  Old Firm clashes and admits the best part of his career was spent in  battles with the Light Blues.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He said: &ldquo;I also liked playing at Ibrox. The surface was usually good and the atmosphere was always volatile.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I played on the winning side there on several occasions under O&rsquo;Neill.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;There was something sweet about stepping in to the lions&rsquo; den and beating Rangers on their own turf.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;It  gave me a great level of satisfaction to know how much the Rangers fans  were hurting after we&rsquo;d beaten their team. Beating Rangers was great.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Knowing I&rsquo;d helped to make hundreds of thousands of Celtic fans happy was extremely satisfying.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Celtic  are like no other team I&rsquo;ve played for. I still feel so much for  Celtic, the club&rsquo;s fans, the people who work there and my former  team-mates.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I had the greatest five years of my life in Glasgow  playing for Celtic under Martin and it&rsquo;s something I will always  treasure.&rdquo;   </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  Ex-Celtic hero Chris Sutton: I&#39;ll never forgive Gordon Strachan for driving me out of club</span></h3><br><span class="diffAdd">Oct 2 2011 Mark Guidi, Sunday Mail</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">CHRIS SUTTON was distraught when he had to leave Celtic after almost six years in Paradise.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And the Englishman blames Gordon Strachan for bringing the happiest time of his career to an end.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In his explosive new book Paradise and Beyond, Sutton lifts the lid on his stormy relationship with the former Parkhead boss.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The striker loved life at Celtic Park under Martin O&rsquo;Neill after his &pound;6million move from Chelsea in 2000.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He played a key role in helping the Hoops win three SPL titles and regain their credibility in Europe.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But it all turned sour when Strachan replaced O&rsquo;Neill in 2005.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Within  seven months, Sutton was on his way out of Parkhead after a row over  his contract - and the pain of that departure is still raw.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton said: &ldquo;Martin had spent five years building Celtic up to being No.1 in Scotland again.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;The fans at Parkhead adored Martin so it was never going to be easy for Gordon to follow that.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;There  were signs from early in his reign that it might not work out well for  me. I found his pre-season training monotonous and boring.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;In  his first competitive game we played Artmedia Bratislava in a Champions  League qualifier and were battered 5-0. It was a shambles.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I  came off injured when the score was 0-0. Neil Lennon accidentally put  his knee into my face and fractured my right cheekbone in four places.  It was an incredibly painful injury.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I went for an operation the  following morning. The surgeon had to drill into the right-hand side of  my head to put in a plate to help with the cheekbone.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was out injured for two months and during that time Strachan never once spoke to me.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Due to the seriousness of the injury I was very depressed but as far as I was concerned he showed no interest.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;The first time he tried to speak to me was in the players&rsquo; canteen.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was sitting with Lenny when Gordon wandered past and tried to crack a joke with me. I didn&rsquo;t laugh.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;His  assistant Garry Pendrey was with him. Maybe Gordon felt belittled by me  in front of one of his members of staff. At that stage, I couldn&rsquo;t have  cared less what he thought.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I knew Gordon wasn&rsquo;t pleased and it  came as no surprise when I was asked to see him in his office. There  was no small talk on my arrival.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;He asked what my problem was  with him. I told Gordon I didn&rsquo;t have a problem but I was disappointed  he had blanked me for two months when I had an injury.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I told  him he could at least have had the decency to phone and ask how I was  doing. He said he did phone and I said I never received a call.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;He insisted he had. I insisted he hadn&rsquo;t. It was a bit like a pantomime. I still maintain I did not receive a call.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;We  managed to move on from there but I sensed there was an underlying  problem. Between any player and manager there has to be a bond of trust  and I was starting to feel any bonds we had were loosening.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;But I  was then back in the team and Gordon had me playing at centre-forward. I  was looking forward to helping the club win silverware.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;During  November, Gordon and I had conversations about my contract. He made it  clear he wanted me to sign a one-year extension to keep me until the  summer of 2007.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;There was a clause in my contract stating if the club wanted me then my wages would remain the same.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;But  things then began to stall. Gordon came to me just before Christmas and  said there was still a deal on the table but it would not be on the  same money.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;The contract would be based heavily on appearances and I would be taking a drastic cut.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I  told him it was a non-starter. Gordon said he would go back to the  board about it but he never gave me another definitive answer.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was being asked to take a cut of between 50 and 60 percent. The money, though, wasn&rsquo;t the point.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;The point was it was written into my previous contract that I would get a certain amount of money.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Now  let&rsquo;s turn this one around. Had I said I was happy to sign again but  not on the terms we&rsquo;d agreed earlier - I now wanted &pound;18,000 per week  more - would that have been fair of me? No, of course it wouldn&rsquo;t. It  would have been bang out of order.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I believe it was Strachan&rsquo;s  decision to let me go. We agreed I could find a new club and I  eventually signed for Birmingham in January.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;There was no way I could have continued to play for Strachan. He would have driven me nuts.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;During my final few weeks at Celtic I was sad and depressed.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave but couldn&rsquo;t stand it under Gordon. I couldn&rsquo;t trust him.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sutton was then stunned when he bumped into Strachan at a hotel a couple of months later and was greeted like an old friend.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He  said: &ldquo;My wife Sam was down in Birmingham that day with three of our  boys. They were distraught at having to leave Celtic and were all still  upset when they came face to face with Gordon.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;But Strachan  chatted to me as if we were good friends. It was also the first time  he&rsquo;d ever met Sam and as he talked to her I could see she was ready for  telling him what she really thought.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was gobsmacked at the way  he chatted to us all. Maybe he was simply oblivious to it all and  didn&rsquo;t know what a wrench it was for me and my family to leave Celtic  and Glasgow.&rdquo; </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  CHRIS SUTTON</span></h3><br><span class="diffAdd">By David Potter (from KeepTheFaith website)</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Born  in Nottingham in 1973, Chris Sutton has been a remarkable asset for  Celtic since he joined the team in the summer of 2000. He was piqued  apparently at Chelsea &#39;s refusal to play him in the English Cup Final of  2000, and when Martin O&#39;Neill appeared on the scene, he showed no  reluctance to join Celtic. Nor was Martin reluctant to shell out a Club  record fee for Sutton.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Hitherto Chris had played for Norwich City  , Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea . He was a tough competitor but did have  a tendency to get himself into trouble, and the feeling often was that  the three English teams had not seen the best of Chris Sutton.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But  he was an instant success at Celtic, teaming up brilliantly with Henrik  Larsson and scoring in the first minutes of his first Glasgow Derby  (the 6-2 game, in which Chris Sutton netted a brace) to win an early  place in the hearts of the Parkhead Faithful.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Yet his  disciplinary problems kept following him, his most high profile  red-carding being in the 2001 League Cup Final, when perhaps Mr. Dallas  was a little too hard on him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He won all the Scottish medals in  Celtic&#39;s 2000/01 Treble season, the League Championship followed again  in 2001/02 and Chris was of course very unlucky to miss out on more  major honours in 2002/03. His comments about Dunfermline &lsquo;lying down&#39; at  the end of the trophy-less but memorable 2002/03 campaign, although  getting him into a great deal of trouble, were no more than a reflection  of his natural aggression and frustration. Indeed most Celtic  supporters (and not a few disgruntled Dunfermline supporters) were in  agreement with him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In season 2003/04, in which Celtic stormed to  absolute domestic dominance, winning the League and Scottish Cup  Double, and in which the Green And Whitewash was won (all five of  Celtic&#39;s encounters with Rangers were Celtic victories), Chris Sutton  was a very major player. Who can possibly forget Chris Sutton&#39;s 90 th  minute scorcher against Rangers, when the Englishman scored a sublime  goal from distance to secure the Green And Whitewash.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Chris  Sutton has a great deal of similarities to the mighty Jimmy Quinn of a  century ago. He is quite prepared to involve himself in the rough stuff,  and although he has suffered more injuries than most players, is always  prepared to come back for more. He is more than a mere goal-scorer, for  he is a fine distributor of the ball and an inspirational leader of the  line &ndash; a goal-maker and goal-taker!</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Of course, when Chris Sutton  played alongside the Henrik Larsson, Celtic had the almost perfect  strike partnership &ndash; goals galore, skill, movement, aggression and  flair. A nightmare for any opponent &ndash; both at home and in Europe! Chris  was often the perfect foil for Henrik Larsson, with whom he had an  almost telepathic understanding.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">When deployed as a midfielder,  Sutton is aggressive, combative and influential for the entire team &ndash; a  fierce competitor - and his attributes as a central defender are  considerable too.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He is a totally versatile player &ndash; almost the  complete player, in fact - in that he can also play in the defence if  called upon to do so, using his height and power to great advantage. He  can break up an attack and clear a ball, just as competently as he can  create opportunities at the other end of the field.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It could not  of course be said that Chris Sutton was born and bred a Celt. This of  course does not matter. What matters is that he is now as committed a  Celtic player as we are ever likely to see. He is a Celtic supporter  now. Chris is now over thirty. He still has a few years left in him. Let  us hope that we still have a lot to see of this very fine player in the  green and white.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">One thing perhaps disappoints Chris about his  career. He has never really tickled the palate of the England  establishment enough to give him a run in the International team. He has  played one game as a substitute against Cameroon in 1998, but has never  impressed them since. Perhaps we should be glad about that!</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">Chris Sutton</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  Daily Record Sep 2013    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">THE  strongest emotion I&rsquo;m going to experience when I see Stilian Petrov at  Celtic Park tomorrow is how precious life can be.    I was always close  to Stan when we played for Celtic under Martin O&rsquo;Neill, and the most  important thing is he&rsquo;s still with us for this special match to launch  the Petrov family&rsquo;s charitable foundation.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">When Stilian was  first diagnosed with leukaemia, I wouldn&rsquo;t say I feared for him and  that&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s as tough as they come.    But it was a reminder to  me that footballers can sometimes assume ill-health is what happens to  other people.    Yet at Celtic we had former players like Stan, then  John Hartson, with life-threatening illness, as well as Alan Stubbs and  his battle with testicular cancer.    Stan&rsquo;s difficulties came as a  tremendous shock to me and we spoke a lot at the time, as well as  meeting in London when he was receiving hospital treatment there.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He  told me he&rsquo;d played for Aston Villa against Arsenal and felt fatigued  afterwards, only more so than normal.    Stan&rsquo;s good fortune was that  the club made sure he was put through the appropriate tests straight  away and the diagnosis, however distressing, was quickly arrived at.     All you can do then is show your support for him and his wife Paulina. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And  I know from personal experience the way the Celtic fans, and supporters  of other clubs, rallied round him will have been of great assistance to  Stan.    My son James was born in Glasgow when I was at Celtic and he  was a premature baby who suffered a virus that left my wife and I  grateful he pulled through.    James was left with hearing problems but  we&rsquo;re lucky he&rsquo;s still around. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">While I&rsquo;m in Glasgow I&rsquo;m going to  take him back to Yorkhill Hospital to thank the medical staff there for  all they did for us as a family.    That&rsquo;s another reason why I&rsquo;m so  glad Stan&rsquo;s special match has given me the chance to return to Celtic  Park and play on the pitch there for the first time in seven years. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I  really miss Celtic and I wish I was still playing for them.    It&rsquo;s  nature&rsquo;s way that we all get older and life moves on, but to be reunited  with Stan, Henrik Larsson, Lubo Moravcik and Neil Lennon, as well as  all the other guys, will be very special for me.    I didn&rsquo;t want to go  from Celtic Park but I was left with no choice and this will be a highly  nostalgic return in the company of my old gaffer, Martin O&rsquo;Neill.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I  wasn&rsquo;t sure about leaving Chelsea and signing for Celtic because my  perception of Glasgow was it was a troubled, and not very pretty, city.  Then I signed and found my perceptions were 100 per cent inaccurate.     Instead I found a place where people rally round you if your son&rsquo;s ill.  It&rsquo;s also a city that pulled together when Big John launched a  foundation to provide for the less fortunate.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I saw Stan on  TV last Sunday morning and was delighted to see him look so well and  have that mischievous look back in his eyes. Then I read in Record Sport  that he&rsquo;d made a joke about my last television appearance being  memorable because I was wearing a pair of shoes he remembered from 12  years ago.    That&rsquo;s when I knew he was back to normal and I had to get  myself a brand new pair of shoes in honour of this weekend&rsquo;s reunion.     But I&rsquo;ll have to apologise in advance to the 60,000 fans who&rsquo;ve bought  tickets to see Stan&rsquo;s select face Celtic. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I&rsquo;m not in the kind of  shape I was in the last time I shared the home dressing room at Celtic  Park with my mates, and my biggest fear is muscle and co-ordination  problems.    But when I bundled the kids into the car on Thursday night  for the long drive to Glasgow I knew I wouldn&rsquo;t have missed this special  day for the world.    Stan and Henrik had a way of playing that suited  my sometimes limited game perfectly, and the understanding we developed  gave me the happiest phase of my entire career.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I now  consider Glasgow to be my favourite city in the whole of Britain. I  loved every morning I went into training and sat among men who weren&rsquo;t  reluctant to give you their opinion on anything, and that was doubly the  case on match days.    There was a togetherness and a bond among that  group of mature professionals that was never fully replicated for me  anywhere else.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And there was a mental strength shown by  players like Johan Mjallby which made us a team of silent assassins.     But, above all, there was Martin. The manager had an aura about him, as  well as a drive and a passion which carried Celtic forward in the right  direction.    The fans bought into him and Martin gave every one of his  players supreme confidence.    You always felt that you wanted to  impress Martin and do more for him on the park because he was such a  fair man where his players were concerned.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Neil is, was and  always will be his own man, but he fell under the manager&rsquo;s spell  nevertheless.    Those were the times that moulded him into the manager  he has become for Celtic, and helped shape the club he&rsquo;s now taken into  the Champions League over successive seasons.    Martin was charismatic  and always knew which buttons to press in the dressing room before  matches.    Systems are a big thing in football but the game is  essentially about players.    </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The manager made sure Celtic&rsquo;s  players went out confident in ourselves and full of passion for the club  we represented.    When that dressing room door closes behind me  tomorrow, and I start to get ready for a match in the company of my old  friends, time will stand still and the past will become the present.</span>     <span class="diffAdd">Playing is the bit you miss most and when you have been fortunate to  have been at a club like Celtic then you know, with the benefit of  hindsight, that you should feel doubly blessed.  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></div>
