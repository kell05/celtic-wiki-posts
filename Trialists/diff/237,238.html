Similar to George Boateng and Sol Campbell, no-one was crying when this transfer failed to materialise. Neil Lennon was just beginning to make in-roads into the transfer market as a debut manager and one of his first desires was to lure Jimmy Bullard to Celtic on-loan, despite the general consensus among Celtic fans that he was a bit of an arrogant character past his peak.<br><br>Many wondered why Lennon wanted him at Parkhead in the first place. This view of the player was solidly justified when Bullard demanded an extra &pound;30,000 a week wage from the Glasgow giants - the kind of money that is lightyears away from what Celtic would pay to loan any player, let alone a mediocre player with most of his career behind him. Hull City were furious with him as they needed to offload Bullard&#39;s wages to prepare for life in the English Championship, yet he still expected them to pay him during his time away.</td></tr><tr>  <td class="" width="26%"><img align="bottom" alt="Ibrahima Camara" height="315" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/baad683dc12cdd023c88772360b957c8/GW417H315" title="Ibrahima Camara" width="417"></td>  <td class="" width="74%">  <a class="external" href="http://forum.celtictalk.org/topic/15723-source-ibrahima-camara/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Ibrahima Camara</b></a><br><br>A 25-year-old Guinean international full-back available in July of 2010, after falling out of favour at Le Mans.
