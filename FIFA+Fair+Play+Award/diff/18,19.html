But no matter where Celtic FC plays &ndash; whether near or far from its  Glasgow roots &ndash; a flood of faithful supporters is certain to follow. If  you inject the emotional charge of a European championship match into  the mix, the magnetic pull on those whose hearts bleed Celtic green  becomes all but irresistible.<br><br>For the occasion, upwards of 80,000  supporters bearing the distinctive hoop-green jerseys made the  pilgrimage to southern Spain to witness the 2003 UEFA Cup title match  that pitted Celtic&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bhoys&rdquo; against FC Porto of Portugal. Hoping to  refresh the taste of past European glories, the mass of Celtic fans  transformed Seville from quiet neutral venue to electric home ground &ndash;  never mind the fact that the site of the Final, the Estadio Olympico,  only had room for 45,000 spectators.<br><br>Although simple mathematics  told them that not even half of those who descended upon the Spanish  city would find themselves fortunate enough to see the game from inside  the stadium, this small detail became a rallying cry rather than  discouraging would-be pilgrims from not just around Europe, but also  across the globe. &ldquo;Everyone felt like they had to be there,&rdquo; said Eddie  Toner, General Secretary of the Celtic Supporters Association. &ldquo;Celtic  supporters think of themselves as a community &ndash; a real family. They all  wanted to go and be a part of the experience together.&rdquo;<br><br>As the  weekend prior to the Wednesday night showdown began, the looming  fortress walls of the ancient Alc&aacute;zar bore witness to a steady stream of  shamrock-crested jerseys entering the city. Though the Spaniards&rsquo;  weekend was winding down, the Celtic &ldquo;extended&rdquo; weekend was just getting  into high gear. Fanning out from the banks of the R&iacute;o Guadalquivir, the  Hoops faithful filled the narrow streets and plazas in the city centre  not only with their energy, but with their infectious and playful  delight as well.<br><br>Over the course of a few days, Seville became a  Celtic haven as it seemed everywhere you turned there were emerald  smiles and songs. When the majority of the 25,000 Porto fans made their  belated appearance the day before the match, the green-clad partygoers  welcomed their opponents with open arms. Soaking in the sunshine,  marvelling in the city&rsquo;s architecture and sharing in the plentiful  bounty of tapas and cervesas, Seville witnessed 100,000 football  fanatics turn their city into a continuous fiesta of good will and Fair  Play.<br><br>&ldquo;Celtic and Porto fans revelled in the party together &ndash; it  really became a carnival of football celebration,&rdquo; beamed Toner. &ldquo;It was  a great example of what supporting a team should be about.&rdquo; Even after  Porto&rsquo;s Brazilian striker Derlei ended Celtic&rsquo;s title hopes with a  dramatic and heartbreaking goal in the 115th minute, the Celtic  supporters maintained their good cheer.<br><br>Although football has too  often in the past been beleaguered by the blight of a few ruffians who  spoil the party at the expense of the real fans, the supporters of  Celtic FC were a shining illustration of the meaning of Fair Play during  their stay in Seville &ndash; jubilant in celebration, stalwart in support  and although beaten in the score-line, utterly undefeated in spirit.<br><br>&ldquo;Thanks  to their exploits across Europe in recent years, Celtic&rsquo;s travelling  supporters have now become a byword for good-natured sporting friendship  and unswerving devotion to their team,&rdquo; said Celtic Executive Director  Peter Lawwell. FIFA couldn&rsquo;t agree more and is proud to recognise the  supporters of Celtic FC with the FIFA Fair Play Award 2003.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Euro Final Celtic Fans Set to Net World Fair Play Award </h3>By Jude Sheerin, Scottish Press Association <br><br>The  Celtic fans who descended on Spain in their tens of thousands for this  year&rsquo;s Uefa Cup final were nominated for an award by the world football  governing body today.<br><br>Fifa said the Hoops faithful deserve a Fair Play Award for their <b>excellent behaviour</b>  at the match in Seville.

European football&#39;s governing body paid tribute to the 80,000 fans that had travelled to Seville to help create a fiesta atmosphere in the Spanish city. <br><br>Celtic Supporters Association general secretary Eddie Toner said: &quot;The Fair Play Award is a fantastic tribute to the Celtic supporters who represented the club in Europe so magnificently last season. &quot;Celtic supporters have travelled in large numbers throughout Europe over many years and they have rightly earned an excellent reputation during this time. &quot;The Fair Play Award is further recognition of the Celtic supporters&#39; high standing in Europe and an honour which is well deserved.&quot; <br><br>Celtic chairman Brian Quinn added: &quot;The backing the team received from supporters throughout our entire Uefa Cup run both home and away was overwhelming and the supporters&#39; behaviour was a credit to the club. &quot;Despite the disappointment in Seville, Celtic&#39;s Uefa Cup challenge and the crucial role which the supporters played in this effort will be remembered and treasured for years to come.&quot;<br><br>Celtic season ticket holders John Byrne and John Gallagher accepted the award at the annual Uefa Football Gala in Monte Carlo. Uefa also confirmed that it is to present a special plaque to the club&#39;s fans at Celtic Park before a match in September. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Blatter praises Celtic Park<font face="Helv"> </font></h3><font face="Helv">(<font face="Arial">BBC)</font>   <br><font face="Arial">Fifa president Sepp Blatter has suggested that Celtic Park is fit to host the final of a major tournament. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Blatter was in Glasgow to present the club&#39;s fans with the Fifa Fair Play Award for 2003. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">&quot;I have seen a lot of stadia during my 20 years working with Fifa and I can say that this stadium is definitely up to hosting any final,&quot; he said. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">&quot;I have seen the pitch, I have seen the stadium, I have seen the facilities - and it&#39;s five-star, definitely.&quot; </font><br><br><font face="Arial">Celtic&#39;s fans received the award for their behaviour before and during last season&#39;s Uefa Cup final, when their side lost to Porto. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">&quot;I was not present in Seville personally, but there were Fifa delegates there and, from the reports that were on TV, I can only say that this is not the first time that Celtic fans have presented themselves as warm and wonderful supporters,&quot; said Blatter. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">He appeared to give a guarded welcome to the idea of Celtic and major rivals Rangers one day playing in the English Premiership - but preferred to see it in the context of a merger between the four British football associations. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">&quot;It is a headache to have four British associations,&quot; he said. </font><br><br><font face="Arial">&quot;If they were together, there would be a wonderful Premier League and more.&quot; </font><br> <br><font size="2"><font face="Arial">Blatter stressed that Fifa&#39;s executive committee would only consider the matter should the Scottish Football Association and its English counterpart agree first to any switch by the Old Firm.</font> </font></font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Hugh McIIvanney&#39;s article, in the Sunday Times, </h3><b>The Voice of Sport, August 31, 2003.</b>   <br><b>Celtic get reward for Seville miracle</b><br><br>Sometimes even football administrators have to be complimented and the tributes are undoubtedly due to Uefa for showing the imagination to rise above tradition by bestowing their fair-play award for last season not on a club but on a mass of paying customers, the amazing worldwide army of Celtic fans. That the Celtic support is a phenomenon totally unique in the whole of sport became undeniable when an estimated 70,000 of the faithful converged on Seville for the Uefa Cup Final in late May, and appropriated that beautiful city for a gigantic street party whose bonhomie remained magnificently undiluted after their team were beaten by Porto. <br><br>The hoariest veteran observers of the scene (All right, I&#39;m talking personally here) had to admit that they had never witnessed anything comparable. It must be said immediately, of course, that the Glasgow club&#39;s following contains plenty of questionable elements. Bigotry and a willingness to be violently contentious are not hard to find in their rank. But when they congregate from across the globe in a vast concentration of allegiance, the warm, sentimental mixture of memories and hopes that binds them together invariably swamps the less attractive tendencies. <br><br>Like Scotland&#39;s tartan army, who have also consistently earned admiration in distant countries, they police themselves. The hardest men among them embrace the wholesome principle that there is nothing more macho than civility and respect for their hosts. Those who step out of line are liable to be reminded forcefully of their responsibilities. <br><br>The Celtic supporters thoroughly deserve the award for the small miracle of Seville. They can hardly be optimistic about their club&#39;s prospects of going far in this year&#39;s Champions League. But winning friends is never a negligible consolation.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Football 365 have picked their highlights of season 2002/03. Here is what they had to say about us.</h3>You&#39;ll Never Walk Alone: May 25   <br><br>Celtic&#39;s end of season was heartbreaking by anyone&#39;s standards. A first European final in 36 years ended in a 3-2 defeat to Porto in Seville, then a final-day goal difference race for the Scottish title with their bitter rivals Rangers saw them briefly in possession only to fall two goals behind, miss a penalty and then hear that the Gers had scored a spot-kick of their own to move out of sight.<br><br>And how did the fans respond? With a chorus of their anthem, perhaps more widely popularised by Liverpool but one that the Celts claim they sang first. Not with recriminations or silence, but words of support. The essence of being a football supporter, as opposed to a mere fan.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>UEFA (2003)</h3><b>UEFA Fair Play Award: Celtic FC supporters   <br></b>An estimated figure of over 80,000 Celtic supporters from all over the world travelled to Seville to support their team in the UEFA Cup final. Embracing the Porto fans who crossed their paths, they converted the city into one huge fiesta and, whether they saw the dramatic final from the stands at the Estadio Ol&iacute;mpico or not, created an atmosphere that the locals will never forget. On behalf of them and the game of football, <b>UEFA</b> can only invite everybody to take their hats off and salute the &#39;Bhoys&#39; from Glasgow.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  FIFA (2003)</h3>Celtic picked up Fifa&#39;s Fair Play Award on behalf of the fans that travelled to last season&#39;s Uefa Cup final.   <br>Around 80,000 travelled to Seville to see their team lose 3-2 to Porto and the honour is for the supporters&#39; &quot;exemplary fair and cordial conduct&quot;.<br><br>Executive director Peter Lawwell said: &quot;Celtic is a unique club with many thousands of fantastic supporters.<br><br>&quot;This award is a tribute to all of them, as they showed last year, they are the best fans in the world.&quot;<br><br>The Fifa prize follows the award in August of Uefa&#39;s equivalent accolade.<br><br>Eddie Toner, general secretary of the Celtic Supporters Association said last week: &quot;I am sure all supporters will be delighted with this tremendous honour.<br><br>&quot;The supporters were a credit to Celtic Football Club and we all hope that we will be fortunate enough to enjoy similar occasions in European football this season.&quot;<br><br>Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill added: &quot;We have been delighted with the backing the team has received from supporters in all the competitions we have been involved in, both home and abroad.
