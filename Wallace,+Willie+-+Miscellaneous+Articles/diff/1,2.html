Did you feel that helped you evolve into a better player by  the time  you arrived in Paradise? </span></i><br><span class="diffAdd">I was never at a bad  club. At  Stenhousemuir, I had the benefit of playing with older players  who had  played at a higher level and were on the way back down and it  was a bit  the same with Raith Rovers. It was a learning curve for me. At  Raith, I  played with Jim Baxter and there was always good information  and help  from the older players. You were never cast aside as you were a   newcomer &ndash; you were looked after. That was the first club where I ever   had a coach. There was a wee fellow called Jackie Stewart, who had   returned from Birmingham and he would work with the boys in the   afternoons. He was the first coach I ever had. I went from being an   outside-right to playing through the middle and up-front, then I started   scoring goals on a regular basis and it was just a gradual climb. But I   had no thoughts, no dreams. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking this is where I am going   and this is how I am going to do it &ndash; it just happened. Again, people   will ask me what did I think as a boy &ndash; did I want to be a player? It   never crossed my mind &ndash; it just happened as other things in my career   happened for me. If someone says alright we are going to sell you, I   went, as I thought people didn&rsquo;t want me there anymore. The same thing   happened when I left Celtic. I thought they must want rid of me when   they got a bid from Crystal Palace and they accepted it &ndash; but that&rsquo;s how   my career had been. </span><br><i><br><span class="diffAdd">At Hearts, you established  yourself as  one of the best goalscorers in the Scottish game and won  international  recognition. Was that another important part in your  progression? </span></i><br><span class="diffAdd">They  had won the league a coupe of years  before, had played in Europe and  they were in the process of rebuilding  the club. So it was a good time.  And a good friend of Jock Stein was  John Harvey, who was the coach at  Hearts at that time. He was a  fantastic man to work with &ndash; just the  same as Jock. He and Jock actually  worked together at Scotland the  first time Jock took the Scotland job.  He was a lovely man and did a  lot for me as a player. He was a similar  type of guy to Jock. He would  come and talk to you and not give any long  speeches and just tell you  little things you were doing wrong or if you  were finding it hard on  occasions and not playing well, he would just  give you a few words and  it would work well for you. </span><br><br><i><span class="diffAdd">You scored frequently against Celtic at Tynecastle. Do you think that helped engineer your move to the Hoops? </span></i><br><span class="diffAdd">I   was just talking with someone recently about this. I never had a   problem scoring against Celtic or Rangers for any of the clubs I played   for. I don&rsquo;t know how it is or how it happens but it just seemed to   happen for me. It wasn&rsquo;t natural but I always found myself in the right   positions to score and as you improve over the years it got easier to   score. But, of course, scoring against Celtic helped my move. They had   to play us on the Saturday after coming back from playing in Europe and   we beat them 3-2 and I scored a couple of goals and that obviously must   have stuck on Jock&rsquo;s mind. I was doing alright at the time: I was   scoring goals regularly and was top goalscorer every year I was at   Tynecastle. I had already spoken to Newcastle and Stoke City and had   been trying to get away for a year-and-a-half. The Celtic thing came out   of the blue but it happened in a natural way &ndash; it just happened. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  </span><div align="center"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><div align="left"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3><span class="diffAdd">WILLIE WALLACE</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">By David Potter (from KeepTheFaith website)</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic  author and historian, David W Potter, reminisces about a player that  did successfully move from Hearts to The Hoops (presumably because The  Pieman wasn&#39;t around Tynecastle in the 1960s). This player went on to  become a Lisbon Lion and Celtic Legend. This player is Willie &lsquo;Wispy&#39;  Wallace.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">David Potter writes of Willie Wallace, Lisbon Lion and Celtic Legend.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">William  Semple Brown Wallace (hence the nickname Wispy because of the initials  W.S.B.) was born in Kirkintilloch on June 23rd 1940 , at the depth of  the Second World War. Indeed it would be hard to imagine a more  desperate time in the history of the Western World, for France had  surrendered the day before to the Germans. Britain herself had managed  by the skin of her teeth to get her BEF back from Dunkirk a few weeks  previously, and was now girding herself up for the inevitable invasion.  Yet Mr. and Mrs. Wallace gave their son the name of a famous Scottish  patriot, and fortunately Spitfires and D-Day saved the young Willie  Wallace for posterity.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Being brought up in Kirkintilloch, and of a  non-Catholic family, it was inevitable that Willie would support  Rangers. But he was far more interested in playing the game and he very  soon developed into a speedy forward with an eye for goal and strength  in his shoulders to ward off fierce challenges.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">His junior team  was Kilsyth Rangers, and he turned senior for Stenhousemuir in January  1958. Stenhousemuir were in the Second Division, usually a poorish side,  but in October 1959 he moved up the ladder by signing as a part time  professional for Raith Rovers, a First Divison side, albeit now a  struggling one. He played well enough there, particularly against  Hearts. So much so that Tommy Walker offered Wallace full time terms on  April 25th 1961 , round about the same time as the Bay of Pigs fiasco of  an American invasion of Cuba , and Celtic&#39;s tragic defeat in the  Scottish Cup Final to Jock Stein&#39;s Dunfermline .</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace  impressed everyone at Hearts, but Hearts had had their day. True, they  did win the League Cup in October 1962 (at about the same time as the  Cuban Missile Crisis), but the great days of Conn , Bauld and Wardhaugh  were now slipping into the distant past. Hearts were still a good match  for Celtic, tending to win at Tynecastle but lose at Parkhead, yet their  moment came and went on the same day that Celtic beat Dunfermline to  win the Scottish Cup on April 24th 1965. Hearts had only to prevent  Kilmarnock from winning 2-0 at Tynecastle to win the Championship. But  2-0 for Killie was the score. It was a pivotal day in Scottish history.  It marked the arrival of Celtic and the collapse (for more than 30  years) of Hearts.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace, although still a hero with the  Tynecastle fans, was now disillusioned and there was little doubt that,  as both Celtic and Rangers fancied him, he might move on to one or other  of the big clubs or even to England.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He had the speed, the  strength and a certain amount of aggression. Crucially he could score  goals, but with Jock Stein having signed Joe McBride to supplement the  already impressive Lennox , Chalmers and Hughes, it looked as if any  opportunity of going to Celtic might have disappeared.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Yet Jock  Stein was mightily impressed by Wallace in a 3-3 Scottish Cup Quarter  Final game in March at Tynecastle in which Wallace score the first goal,  and so the summer of 1966 was alive with rumours of a possible  transfer. But the season started with Celtic at Tynecastle in the  pouring rain and Wallace still with Hearts. In fact Hearts had lost  three times to Celtic by the time that Stein acted.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Taking  advantage of the fact that Rangers were in Germany on European business  in early December, Stein pounced and signed Willie Wallace for 30,000  pounds - a bargain price, greedily accepted by a Hearts management well  on the way to bankruptcy through a determination to disillusion their  supporters.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Willie played his debut for Celtic on December 10 th  1966 , didn&#39;t score, but played well enough for some supporters to  display a banner, &quot;Oor Wullie&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace was a phenomenal and  instant success at Celtic Park . Stein saw in him the model professional  who trained hard, was a good influence in the dressing room and obeyed  instructions. Occasionally, his exuberance got the better of him, and on  at least two occasions Wispy got an early bath thanks (in part) to  over-zealous referees, but there was little to complain about in his  attitude to Stein or the club.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In fact, he had less competition  for a place than he might have expected, for sadly Joe McBride was  injured on Xmas Eve 1966 at Pittodrie in a 1-1 draw and took a long time  to come back, never quite being the same player again.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace  immediately slotted into the role of twin striker along with Stevie  Chalmers, although the essential strength of the Celtic system in that  glorious year of 1967 lay in its very fluidity. Sometimes, Wallace lay  behind Chalmers - other times he was up there scoring the goals, notably  in the First Leg of the European Cup Semi Final in April 1967, when he  scored two goals early in the second half and was denied a hat trick  only by hard luck. In the Second Leg in Prague , a grim backs to the  wall experience, Wallace was a brilliant cover defender.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Indeed  April 1967 was a great month for Wallace. He played for Scotland in that  epic 3-2 Wembley win over England (he had already three Scotland caps  when with Hearts and would earn seven in all), and then scored two goals  for Celtic in the Scottish Cup Final win against Aberdeen . The second  goal remains vividly in the memory. A great move down the right flank  involving Craig and Johnstone, then Jimmy sends the ball across to  Wallace, who was standing &quot;like someone waiting for a bus&quot;, and in  exactly the right position to hammer home. The recollection remains of  the ball heading towards the packed green and white masses behind the  goal and only stopped by the net before a hundred or so strangers landed  on one&#39;s back in an orgy of celebration.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Lisbon came next.  Willie didn&#39;t score, but was only prevented from doing so by bad luck,  constantly harrying the Italian defence and earning deserved praise from  the world&#39;s media. The lorry going round Celtic Park the following  night, showing the big, beautifully ugly European Cup to the risen  people, contained Willie Wallace, supporter&#39;s hat on, singing the  supporters&#39; songs and thanking Providence that a career, which was  seeming to stagnate at Hearts about a year previously, had been so  gloriously propelled to triumph.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">For the next four years, Wallace  remained almost a permanent fixture in the Celtic side, taking part in  the triumphs and the odd disaster (Argentina in 1967 and Milan in 1970  spring to mind), always retaining the respect and admiration of his fans  and teaming up so brilliantly with men like Lennox, Chalmers, McBride  and Hood, who in other circumstances might have been seen as rivals for  his place in the team.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He was very much a team man, and all in  all won 5 League medals, three Scottish Cup medals and two League Cup  medals with Celtic.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He left for Crystal Palace with John Hughes  in October 1971, when quite a few supporters thought that he still had a  certain amount of football left in him. But Stein was bringing on  youngsters like Dalglish and Connelly, and felt that Wallace could be  released.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The suspicion remains that the now prickly Stein and  Wallace fell out about something. Whether that is true or not, it is  certainly true that Willie&#39;s career was now on the downward slope,  although he did return to play for Dumbarton along with ex-Celt Charlie  Gallagher and ex-Ranger Davie Wilson between 1972 and 1975.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Willie  Wallace was a Coach with Ross County and Dundee before emigrating to  Australia to play for a team called Apia and to set up a sports  business. But like many another Celt, he will always be Willie Wallace  of Celtic.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Oor Wullie, indeed, and perhaps an even greater man  than the old foe of Edward 1 of England who bears the same name. Those  of us who saw him play for Celtic will never forget him.</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">Willie Wallace recalls a memorable Celtic career</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">Published: 02 June 2013</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Scotland on Sunday</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">By TOM ENGLISH</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Willie   Wallace is reaching for his glasses to look at a picture of the day he   was stripped half-naked in Lisbon by a gang of Portuguese souvenir   hunters.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Aye, that&rsquo;s the one, he says, pointing to the cover  of  his new book, Heart of a Lion. The photograph is of Wallace being   lifted above the invading masses on European Cup final day, a broad   smile on his face as the reality of what he has achieved begins to dawn   on him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when my pants disappear. See if you took that picture a   few seconds later you&rsquo;d be seeing a different expression. They lift me   up and whip my shorts off. Then they put me down and pull the jersey   over the top and they&rsquo;re away with that an&rsquo; all. It was bloody mayhem.   None of these people are from Glasgow. Well, the boy with the bobble hat   at the back is, but look at the rest. You can tell. That tanned boy   there. And that one. And them two over there, no way they&rsquo;re Glasgow.   They&rsquo;ll be Lisbon. Where&rsquo;s that jersey now I wonder.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He is   laughing at the memory of it. And the memory of what followed. He has   made his way to the dressing room area in his boots and underpants. He   has Jock Stein on one side of him, Bill Shankly on the other and some   dishevelled mates from Kirkintilloch right in front and telling how   they&rsquo;d just been robbed amid the delirium of the greatest day any of   them would ever know. &ldquo;Money and passports away, Willie. Rifled.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;What am I gonna do, boys? I&rsquo;m lucky to have my pants,&rdquo; says Wallace.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">As   if it was yesterday, Wallace recalls Stein&rsquo;s hand dipping into his   pocket and a roll of notes coming out and being handed over. &ldquo;The lads   counted it in front of the boss. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a hundred pound, Mr Stein.   Thank you. We&rsquo;ll drop it into the park when we get home&rsquo;. And they did   as well. Two weeks later, in they came. It&rsquo;s funny the things you   remember, isn&rsquo;t it? Me in my underpants, the Kirki lads with nae money   and Jock and Shanks looking on. Ah, there&rsquo;s a million stories.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And   he&rsquo;s home to tell them, home from his home from home, Australia. The   Gold Coast, to be exact. He&rsquo;s been there for 31 years, has raised a   family there, has grandchildren there, has Olive there, his wife for   more than half a century. One day good, the next day even better. That&rsquo;s   what they say round his way.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">On this Wednesday lunchtime in   Glasgow he is talking about it all. The formative years at Stenhousemuir   and Raith Rovers, the 127 goals in 239 appearances for Hearts, the 134   goals in 215 starts for Celtic, the trophies, the team-mates, the   rivals. He was never the star of the Lisbon Lions and that suited him,   he says. He&rsquo;s been called the forgotten Lion and that has never bothered   him. Jinky, Billy McNeill, Tommy Gemmell, they lapped up the limelight   in a way that he never wanted to. &ldquo;I was always happy just to slip out   the side door.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He tells of the difference between himself and   his mate Tam Gemmell. It was the late 1960s and Celtic were in America   to play a series of games against Manchester United. Some of the boys   were at a cabaret evening in Fort Lauderdale. The Lions walked in and   immediately everybody in the ballroom stood up and started applauding.   &ldquo;They all thought that Tam was [the American actor and comedian] Danny   Kaye. They were going crazy. And what did Tam do? Only go along with it.   He went up on stage with these lovely Hawaiian dancers pretending to  be  Danny Kaye. A couple of their skirts hit the deck. Tam lapped up the   attention even when the attention didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with  him.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Like  his team-mates, Walace was brought up in harsh times.  He was only a  young boy when his father, a foundry worker, contracted  tuberculosis and  spent a year in hospital in Helensburgh. Quite a spin  from his home in  Kirkintilloch to his father&rsquo;s bedside. Two buses and a  whole lot of  walking.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Things were hard. We didn&rsquo;t have  anything. When I talk  to kids today I say &lsquo;life to you is money&rsquo;. That  was a word I never  knew. I didn&rsquo;t have any and I wasn&rsquo;t going to get  any. If you wanted  something you went and found lemonade bottles or jam  jars or you did a  paper round. You&rsquo;ve seen that Open All Hours? The  boy with the bike?  That was me. I did the messages on the bike from the  age of 13. Then I&rsquo;d  play my football and then back on my bike and my  legs would be sore,  but you&rsquo;d have to have the messages delivered by  six o&rsquo;clock at night.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace  had a natural talent for scoring  goals. In two seasons with Raith  Rovers he banged in 29 goals in 63  starts and was promptly sold to  Hearts as, one paper put it, &ldquo;the extra  pair of trousers in the suit&rdquo; in  a move that also saw Rovers&rsquo; Willie  Polland move to Tynecastle. &ldquo;Willie  was the jacket and I was the extra  pair of trousers, but the trousers  got paid the same as the jacket, so I  was happy.&rdquo; He was a goal-scoring  machine at Tynecastle, the leading  scorer for five seasons in succession  from 1962/63. He won a League Cup  and almost won a league. He wanted a  rise of a fiver but the manager,  Tommy Walker, wouldn&rsquo;t give it to him,  so he left. He remembers sitting  under a portrait of John Thomson (the  Celtic goalkeeper who died after  a collision during an Old Firm game in  1931) at Celtic Park in the  autumn of 1966 while the deal was being done  to sign him. He went in  the door thinking his future lay in Newcastle.  He came out as one of  Stein&rsquo;s canniest purchases. At a shade under  &pound;30,000 he was a steal to  beat all steals.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace used to  frequent a pub in Torrance in  those days. Every Tuesday night he&rsquo;d be in  there for a pint and a game  of darts. The proprietor was a tough old  bird, a Rangers supporter who  found the news that one of her regulars  had joined the other side too  much to bear. &ldquo;I went in there the  following Tuesday and she says  &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going  to play my darts&rsquo;. She said  &lsquo;No, you&rsquo;re no&rsquo;. Out!&rsquo; She was serious. I  was barred.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In  football, there are fairytales and then there is  what happened to  Wallace in his first season at Celtic. In the space of  six weeks he  scored two critical goals in the European Cup semi-final  first leg  against Dukla Prague, played for Scotland in the storied 3-2  win over  world champions England at Wembley, won the league championship  and the  Scottish Cup and then rounded it off by winning the European  Cup.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The  Dukla matches saw Wallace at his finest, not just as a  predator in the  first leg in Glasgow but as a team player in the second  leg in Prague,  which Celtic started with a 3-1 lead. &ldquo;Jock had said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m  gonna  sacrifice a little bit today because if we come away 0-0 we&rsquo;ve  done  something that nobody else has done in Britain&rsquo;. He wanted me to  keep  an eye on their star player, Josef Masopust. I said &lsquo;I hope I&rsquo;m up  to  what you&rsquo;re asking me to do&rsquo;. &lsquo;Just be with him&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re   with him they&rsquo;ll think twice about using him and he&rsquo;s their channel,   he&rsquo;s their everything&rsquo;. I just shadowed him. Fortunately I got a chance   early on him to give him a little rattle and he wasn&rsquo;t too happy about   that. He was a magnificent footballer, but he didn&rsquo;t enjoy it. At the   end of the game I went to change shirts and he whacked me. But to be   fair to the man, it was his last chance to get to the final of the   European Cup and he came in later and gave me the jersey. He said   congratulations.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Masopust&rsquo;s jersey is up in the loft in   Australia. There&rsquo;s boxes of stuff up there. Jerseys, medals, newspaper   cuttings. The odd time he&rsquo;ll go there for a look and be reminded of how   long ago it all was. And yet how vivid it all remains.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;You know   the wardrobe story?&rdquo; he asks. &ldquo;Bertie Auld&rsquo;s brother an&rsquo; that?&rdquo; This  is  how daft life was at Celtic sometimes, a level of bonkerdom that  makes  him chuckle even now, 46 years after he opened the wardrobe door  in his  room in the hours after the European Cup final and found Bertie  Auld&rsquo;s  brother in there.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was rooming with Bert. I said &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s  this?&rsquo;  Bert said it&rsquo;s his brother, Ian. &lsquo;I said &lsquo;Aye, but what&rsquo;s he  doing in  the wardrobe?&rsquo; Ian pipes up: &lsquo;I got thrown out of my hotel&rsquo;.  &lsquo;What for?&rsquo;  &lsquo;I broke up a table and chair and I was lighting a fire&rsquo;. I  said &lsquo;Bert,  get this bastard out of here&rsquo;. He said he couldn&rsquo;t. The  wives were on  the way back to the hotel from the airport because their  aircraft  couldn&rsquo;t take off and if Liz [Auld] found Ian in the room  she&rsquo;d go  mental. I think there was friction. So he was in the wardrobe  when the  wives came back and then he fell asleep and started snoring.  Liz is  sitting on the bed saying &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; And we&rsquo;re going &lsquo;That&rsquo;s  Luggy  [John Clark] through the wall&rsquo;. Bert wrote in his book that his  brother  had hid under the bed, but it was one of they beds that you  couldn&rsquo;t get  an envelope under. I met him years later and he said  &lsquo;Christ, you&rsquo;re  right. It was the bloody wardrobe!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">At Celtic,  goal followed  goal and trophy followed trophy. Twenty-one goals in  1966/67, 25 the  next season, then 33, 24 and 28 in the years after  that. In his only  four starts of the 1971/72 season he scored three  times, two of them in  the European Cup. He&rsquo;d already been told that he  was in the team for the  next round against Sliema Wanderers of Malta  when he got a knock on his  door at 6am at Seamill and was told to meet  Stein downstairs. &lsquo;You  gotta go up the park&rsquo; was the message. &lsquo;Crystal  Palace are wanting to  talk to you&rsquo;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I came down and had  breakfast with the boss and he  never opened his mouth. He never said a  word all the way to the ground  either and I wasn&rsquo;t volunteering  anything. The Crystal Palace thing just  came out of the blue. No  warning. I suppose it was building up inside  me on the way in the car.  &lsquo;If they don&rsquo;t want me, I&rsquo;ll go. Stuff &rsquo;em.&rsquo; I  had a terrible feeling.  It was like being dragged out of your bed and  being sacked. &lsquo;If you  don&rsquo;t want me then I&rsquo;m off&rsquo;. I got it in my head  that if they&rsquo;ve  brought me up here then they don&rsquo;t want me and I&rsquo;d  rather be where I&rsquo;m  wanted. So I came out of the meeting with Crystal  Palace and Jock asked  what I was doing and I said I&rsquo;d signed and he  stormed off and muttered  something underneath his breath. To this day I  don&rsquo;t know what it was.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the bit I couldn&rsquo;t understand. I  thought he&rsquo;d say &lsquo;Right, good luck&rsquo;. I  thought he wanted me to move but I  understand a bit more now. He was  under pressure from above. It was  done in stealth. I had no inclination  of leaving Celtic. I wanted to  finish my career there and from what I  hear Jock wanted me to stay but  had to be seen to be presenting me with  the offer to leave. Aye, I was  hurt by it. I always wondered why he  didn&rsquo;t say something over breakfast  or in the car to the park.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Nothing  ever lived up to Celtic in  the remainder of his career. How could it?  There wasn&rsquo;t much glory, but  there was fun and it shines through. The  laughs. The great players. The  privilege of having such a fantastic  life in the game. He&rsquo;s talking now  of a match he once played in  Melbourne, a charity game at a provincial  ground involving local  players and three big names &ndash; Wallace, George  Best and Ferenc Puskas.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;There  was a little Glasgow guy called  Joe Docherty in charge of our team and  he says &lsquo;OK, is everybody here?&rsquo;  And somebody says &lsquo;No, Puskas is  missing&rsquo;. Puskas had walked through the  gate and there was this Irish  guy working there and he said &lsquo;Woah, wait  a minute, who are you?&rsquo;  Puskas was a little fat man at this stage. He  said &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Ferenc Puskas&rsquo;  and the boy on the gate said &lsquo;Aye, that&rsquo;ll be  f****** right. My arse&rsquo;.  We had to go and get him. That story always  makes me laugh. He was  outside the gate for ages. Ferenc Puskas!&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The  memories flow on.  Billy Bremner getting booed for kicking Pele at  Hampden. Swapping  shirts with George Best on his international debut.  Alfredo Di  Stefano&rsquo;s benefit match in Barcelona. &ldquo;There was a suite  given over to  Alfredo&rsquo;s presents. Wall-to-wall gold. Clocks, watches,  statues. Never  seen anything like it.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Riches, for sure. But none  quite like  Lisbon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to see Tam in the morning. He doesn&rsquo;t get  out much  these days. I&rsquo;ll remind him of the Hawaiian dancers.&rdquo; Tales to  last a  lifetime.</span><br><br><i><span class="diffAdd">Heart of a Lion: The life and times of Lisbon Lion William Wallace (published by CQN Books)</span></i><br><i><span class="diffAdd">\\\\\\\\\\\\</span></i><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">Willie Wallace: Lisbon celebrations are tinged with sadness</span></h3><br><span class="diffAdd">http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/willie-wallace-lisbon-celebrations-are-tinged-with-sadness-1-4456249</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Willie Wallace with the European Cup trophy at the civic reception to mark the 50th anniversary of Celtic&#39;s victory in 1967. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">ANDREW SMITH</span><br><span class="diffAdd">The  50-year anniversary of Celtic&rsquo;s European Cup triumph is a time for  commemoration as well as celebration. Having lived in Australia for the  past 35 years, Willie Wallace is, perhaps, made more acutely aware of  the effects of time than any other Lisbon Lion. The 76-year-old is back  in Scotland for a series of events to mark the half-century elapsing  since the epic victory and it is the second time he has been back in his  old country inside three months. Yet, in that intervening period, the  Lions have been altered irrevocably.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I love coming back but it  saddens me that the team is falling apart due to ill health and those  who have passed away,&rdquo; Wallace said. &ldquo;Every time I come back there are  less members. I was with Tommy Gemmell about three days before he died  but I had to go back as I was going down to New Zealand. I was in New  Zealand when he passed away. I didn&rsquo;t fly back. It&rsquo;s a long way.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">That  night in the Portuguese capital when Jock Stein&rsquo;s side overcame the  mighty Internazionale with an awe-inspiring display of attacking prowess  Wallace calls &ldquo;a fairytale&rdquo;. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Yet the forward, signed by Stein in  December 1966 for &pound;30,000 from Hearts, just as readily places the feat  in a more prosaic context.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not being blas&eacute; about it but at that  time it was just another game in a way because we&rsquo;d won the league and  Scottish Cup final and, before I got there, lifted the League Cup.  Within six months of joining Celtic, I won everything. If someone had  said that to me when I signed I&rsquo;d have phoned the asylum. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a  fairytale, something you can&rsquo;t write. To sit in and think about it now  is unbelievable. I&rsquo;d already won the League Cup with Hearts and missed  out on the league championship by .04 of a goal when Kilmarnock beat  us.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace can be set apart from his fellow makers of Scotland&rsquo;s  greatest football success. He is the lone Lion, the Lion who left &ndash; the  only one of that fabled XI to be signed by Stein following the peerless  manager&rsquo;s appointment by Celtic in early 1965, and the only one of that  group of men not to remain in Scotland for their adult lives. Wallace  doesn&rsquo;t see Stein&rsquo;s decision to go and get him as making him different  in his boss&rsquo;s eyes. The fact that he actually only played in the second  leg of the Dukla Prague semi-final victory and the Lisbon final itself  might illustrate that point. Wallace&rsquo;s signing, on 6 December, 1966,  came only three weeks before the, by then, 30-goal Joe McBride was lost  for the season with a knee problem.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I just got treated the same. It  wasn&rsquo;t any different. He [Stein] bought me for as cheap as he could. It  was amazing for me. I  fitted in there within two weeks. I&rsquo;d known most  of them from Scotland. It wasn&rsquo;t the wrench that moving from club to  club normally is.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Of course I felt sorry for Joe. I was good friends  with him. I was quite surprised when you look back and count up the  matches played in the European Cup that Joe only played in two. That  surprised me as I always thought Joe had been a permanent member of the  side until his injury. But that was the gaffer. You weren&rsquo;t guaranteed  to play. Jock Stein never played the same guys up front. The defence  stayed stayed the same but you never knew who the front five would be.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace  never knew Australia would become his adopted home even after he had  played two years for APIA Leichhardt Down Under. Equally, though, he  admits he would have expected other Lions to have travelled outside  Scotland.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;It did surprise me [that I was the only one that left].  Bobby Lennox went to America for a couple of games but I think that was  it. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;When I went to Australia I played for an Italian club, funnily  enough, in Sydney and we won the league two years in a  row and we won  the cup two years in a row.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I came back here and was at Ross County  for a few months and then big TG [Tommy Gemmell] got Dundee, so I went  there with him for three years.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Then one winter&rsquo;s night I came home  from training and the president of my old club in Sydney told me they  were moving into the national league and offered me the job.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;It was  snow and ice outside. The kids wanted to go right away and that was it.  So I&rsquo;ve been down there 35 years now. I&rsquo;ve never regretted it for a  minute.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I still phone the Lions up regularly. It&rsquo;s mainly Bertie  [Auld] and John Clark or wee Bobby sometimes. I phone more than I do  e-mailing or texting and things like that.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">And Wallace is never far  removed from the events of 1967, wherever he goes. &ldquo;I go over to a  little tournament in Brittany [France] with some under-13 teams in  Australia and the guys I meet are all  Celtic supporters. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;They were  still showing me the newspapers from 1967 just last year &ndash; all the  reports of the game. They were as  happy that we beat the Italians as   anybody. Throughout the world there are guys who walk up to you and  tell you  in Chinese that they are a Celtic  supporter.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Wallace yesterday attended a civic reception held in honour of the Lions at Glasgow&rsquo;s City Chambers.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">The  grace and favour of the occasion inspired one enquiry to him about the  knighthoods some believe the Lions should be awarded en masse for one of  the supreme British sporting achievements.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;The knighthood issue has never bothered me,&rdquo; Wallace said. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was born and bred in Kirkintilloch and didn&rsquo;t have a penny to go to the cinema sometimes, so I don&rsquo;t look for these things.&rdquo; </span><i><br></i><br><i><img align="bottom" alt="Wallace, Willie - The Celtic Wiki" height="467" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d8380aeb35ec9e9ae1b6ce1b37324058/GW700H467" title="Wallace, Willie - The Celtic Wiki" width="700"><br><br></i><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><span class="diffRemove">     </span></div>
