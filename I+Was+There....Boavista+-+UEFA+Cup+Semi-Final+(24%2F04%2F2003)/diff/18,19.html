How had the experience been to that point? </b><br><br>I was fortunate enough to see Celtic beat Real Madrid in 1980 in the European Cup quarterfinal at Celtic Park. In those days, you only had to win two ties to play European football after Christmas. That season we beat the Albanian champions, Partizana Tirana, and Dundalk (just!) to get there. We hadn&#39;t played in Europe since then and it was being put up as some holy grail for us. People forget that if the Rapid Vienna result had stood, which it should have, we would have made it in 1984/5 and there&#39;s no saying how different things would have been. I&#39;d been to a lot of away games in Europe and seen some pumpings, some plucky defeats, some draws, the odd win and very few goals. All that was to change in season 2002/03.<br><br>The first away trip for us was Blackburn. For all their possession in Glasgow they had rarely threatened to score and we were very confident of going through. We managed to get a few pints in a Rovers fans&#39; pub and we told them to watch out for Henrik. We got the usual, he only plays in a pub league, replies but you can guarantee they were spewing early in the game when he scored. Sutton&#39;s goal was a peach and the sing song from then on was brilliant. Full time when Souness came on the big screens to explain the defeat was brilliant. All the Blackburn fans had gone home and he could clearly hear us singing Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnisss.<br><br>Vigo was a day trip for me. The usual shambolic policing pre match and a lax attitude to seat numbers meant this was a bit of a free for all. I feared we were out before this game and, to be honest we should have been. We got lucky but we probably deserved some and Hartson&#39;s goal was a peach. Again, a major sing song on qualification. At the game I met a bhoy from London (we&#39;ll call him Sharpy) whom I hadn&#39;t seen for a few years. We shared a (manly) hug or two at the goal and the final whistle. We agreed that this was an omen and that we should meet each other in whichever city we were going to next. I flew home from Compostela and missed the battles at Vigo airport. I was just delighted to get through and had no real expectation as to future progression.<br><br>Met Sharpy in a boozer pre match in Stuttgart and the tie was all over in the first ten minutes as Agathe tore them apart. A nervy last few minutes but realistically we knew we were through. Stuttgart put a message up at the end of the game wishing us all the best at Anfield Road and it hit home then what we had to do to go further. The lowlight of that trip was Bonnie Tyler&#39;s pre match caterwauling.<br><br>Anfield was a blast. Met Sharpy in the Holiday Inn down near the Liver building pre game. Once Hartson scored we were on easy street and we really deserved to get through. It was that night I started to believe that we would get to the final but I really wanted to get Boavista as I believed they were the easiest team in the draw and, therefore, gave us the best chance of getting to Seville. Still did nothing about booking a ticket although, to be fair, I knew I&#39;d qualify for one through Celtic. Being at Anfield that night was the best experience I&#39;d had as a Celtic supporter as we&#39;d pumped a big European club in their own midden and our support was outstanding. There was green and white in every area of the ground that night. <br><br><br><b><br>When Boavista were paired with Celtic in the semi-final draw what was your initial reaction? </b><br><br>As above, I was delighted. I knew they were really struggling in the league and they only had a couple of players I&#39;d heard of. I wasn&#39;t overly happy about going back to the city of Oporto (I&#39;d been there for the 3-0 gubbing the season before), as it truly is a coup but I really didn&#39;t want to draw Lazio. Ole Pa McSwain, who along with carryondoc and Sevilliano was going to every game with me, was ecstatic we got Boavista as months previously he had booked a holiday in the Algarve and the away draw fell perfectly for his week. Ole Ma McSwain wasn&#39;t too happy <img alt=";)" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/bNBgxmR48VbUVqH2tNX1Eg644" title=";)"><br><br>I was very confident approaching the tie.........<br><br><br><b>The first-leg at Parkhead didn&rsquo;t go exactly to plan with Celtic having to settle for a rather disappointing 1-1 draw. With a tricky tie in Portugal ahead were you still confident of reaching the final? </b><br><br>The first leg was a total let down. Going up to the ground everything just felt a little off kilter to me. It was the semi final of a European trophy yet here we were kicking off early in the evening (so both games could be on live in Portugal), just after most people had finished work. There was no real chance to get a few pints down the neck to calm the nerves or lubricate the vocal chords. The atmosphere was both flat and nervy and Boavista were a horrible team to watch. They had no stars, no flair players and just sat in and defended for their lives. When they scored the deflation was tangible as I think most of the fans thought we&#39;d blown it. A draw for me was OK as we&#39;d drawn at home to Liverpool and still beaten them. I felt Boavista had to at least come out at home and try score. With Larsson and Sutton in our team , and MON as our manager, I also believed we could now score anywhere (changed days :lol:) and was still felt we had a really good chance to get through. The downside was that when I did consider the possibility that we could get knocked out, I couldn&#39;&#39;t believe that it would be to Boavista as they were genuinely the worst team we&#39;d played in the tournament (Suduva excepted). I doubt I was alone on this opinion.<br><br><br><b>What do you remember about the build up in the days prior to the second-leg? </b><br><br>There is a perception amongst Celtic supporters that the media is totally anti Celtic and only runs negative stories. My recollection of that time is that most of the print journos and radio guys- with the exception of overt huns like BFDJ- were all willing us to do it. I also felt that fans of other teams wanted us to get through. Btw I don&#39;t care about BFDJ/hun supporters not wanting us to do well as that is their right. I never want the huns to win a game either. The build up was the usual pre big tie stuff- stories from Portugal about how they would &quot;end our dream&quot;, match report from their game the week before they played us, guesses as to the teams/formations, the &quot;90 minutes from destiny&quot; stuff. No cliche remained unturned. I just couldn&#39;t wait to get out there and see the game as I knew I was one of the lucky few thousand to get a brief and this was the biggest Celtic game in my adult life.<br><br><br><b>So how was the journey? </b><br><br>Ole Pa McSwain went on his hols the Saturday before the game. He phoned me on the Monday or Tuesday to tell me that my mum had taken a nasty tumble on some cobble stones and that had a badly sprained ankle. It was looking like he wasn&#39;t going to be able to get up for the game so he was gutted. He phoned back the next day to say that swelling had gone down a bit, they&#39;d met a Scottish (tim) doctor in their hotel and he had convinced her that she would be OK to travel <img alt=":suspect:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/iU8ff0qgJqIeEcHeWXVjDA201" title=":suspect:"> Their arrangements were straightforward- an 8 hour bus journey from Albufeira with a 1 hour stop off in Lisbon <img alt=":lol:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/0bjhQbTBtlxId4Qfxm0OTQ515" title=":lol:"><br><br>We had arranged to meet down at the riverside in Oporto where all the bars and restaurants are.<br><br>My travel arrangements were equally fraught. Carryondoc and myself were flying out early on the morning of the game with an overnight stay booked for after the game. About 10pm, I started to get my bag packed for the next day getting all the essentials looked out such as plane ticket, hotel booking, match ticket, money, hoops and scarf. I couldn&#39;t find my passport. I went through every drawer, cupboard and coat pocket in my house but still couldn&#39;t find it. I phoned cod to tell him I was struggling and might not make the flight. We agreed I would chance my arm and try travel without passport if I couldn&#39;t find it. I went to bed about 12:30 but couldn&#39;t sleep. I got up about 3am to look for the passport again. Did all the drawers, cupboards, cats, shirt and trouser pockets, bags, cases etc and still nothing. By this time there was stuff strewn all over the floor and I was really panicking because I knew I wasn&#39;t going to get on that plane. I decided to have one last sweep of the house and lo and behold, stuffed right down the back of the couch where, the then four year old McSwainette had hidden it, was the passport. A quick scream of YA FECKING DANCER and I was on my to the airport.<br><br>No (other) problems getting over, flight was fine, fans were in very good fettle and most were extremely confident that we&#39;d get through, checked in to the hotel, dumped the gear and out to meet Sevilliano and my maw and paw at the riverside. The rendez-vous with Sharpy was still to be arranged.<br><br><br><br><b>Boavista&rsquo;s stadium at that time had a very small capacity. How did the number of Celtic fans travelling compare to previous European trips that season? </b><br><br>Boavista&#39;s ground was under reconstruction for Euro 2004 and both ends were closed. We were getting one stand and they were having the other, bigger, stand. My recollection is that we got about 3 or 4 thousand official tickets. This was roughly the same as Anfield, but of course, with the reduced capacity there wasn&#39;t going to be as much chance to get in for the ticketless. We had a huge support in Stuttgart with at least 11k in the ground with a huge turnout from the German Bhoys in the home sections. However, you saw a lot of the same faces on the away trips in those days, and we all knew this was the game for us and we had to back the team with all we could.<br><br><br><b>Given that an all Oporto (Porto v Boavista) UEFA Cup final was a real prospect what was the atmosphere like in the city? </b><br><br>Porto had done the business in the first leg and were expected to get through comfortably. Most of their fans were going to watch their game with Lazio in the bars as they were the early kick off this time. They all wanted us to beat Boavista. As we&#39;d been to Oporto the season before, we knew where to go and meet up. As I mentioned before, Oporto is a real dump and there are only a couple of areas worth going to. So the riverside it was and as this is the main tourist part, it was full of tims and the bars, surprise surprise, were doing a roaring trade with a good sing song going. I remember it as being a bit dull and overcast but it must have been warm enough as we ate outside on a restaurant terrace. About 4 pm, I got a call from my parents to say they were just round the corner. It must have taken them about another 5 minutes to walk round the corner as my mum&#39;s ankle was about the size of Gary Caldwell&#39;s head (obviously, I couldn&#39;t have used that comparison at the time <img alt=";)" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/bNBgxmR48VbUVqH2tNX1Eg644" title=";)"> )<br><br>We decided to get up nearer the ground early so that she was OK to get in so we got a taxi up to the Meridian hotel just across from the ground (where just by sheer coincidence Sharpy was staying). I can honestly say that until we got there I hadn&#39;t seen a Boavista fan. The Meridian was absolutely brilliant for pre-match. One of MON&#39;s daughters was in with Henrik&#39;s missus and both of them joined in the singing. Before we all left to go to the match it was YNWA, the Celtic Song and a big huddle with both of them taking full part <img alt=":worthy:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/YciyGh7Q9W1cQQ729wuh6Q1779" title=":worthy:"><br><br>Coming out of the hotel, you had to cross a big boulevard to get to the ground and it was there that we realised that we were in the affluent part of the city. It was a really nice area, with a lot of decent hotels. My old man swapped their reservation onto one of them so they didn&#39;t have to walk anywhere post game. Once you got to the ground, you could see it was just a building site and, for a game of that magnitude, it looked pretty crap.<br><br><br><br><b>So you finally reach the turnstile. How are you feeling? </b><br><br>We all split up into our different areas of the ground and swapped tickets about so my maw had less steps to negotiate. The stadium wasn&#39;t at all impressive. Two big stands behind the goal under construction and two stands sort of like the main stand at Easter Road. The police were fine and there was no trouble unlike the menacing attitude they&#39;d taken when we visited in 01, when they were threatening to baton all and sundry outside the ground. We all genuinely believed that we were going to get through. We could only see Boavista scoring one at the most and felt that we had enough firepower to do them. Having said that there was still the nagging feeling at the back of my head that this crappy outfit would play for a 0-0 and get it. So I was confident but a tad nervous. <br><br><br><b>Can you describe the atmosphere at kick-off? </b><br><br>I was sitting/standing next to Sharpy and the support was right up for the game. Unlike Boavista&#39;s. Their support was bloody appalling and they didn&#39;t even sell out their one stand. I wished they&#39;d let us have the tickets as we&#39;d have filled it no bother but you could see that a few of our bhoys had sneaked in <img alt=":clap:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MPYnphQTh2wkwyBUoKq1ZA584" title=":clap:"><br>The pre-match singing and the reaction to the team coming out and the huddle was absolutely unbelievable. The team knew they were going to be backed unconditionally.<br><br><br><b>Half-time and after a rather tight and tense 45 minutes the game remains goalless. What are your memories of that opening period? </b><br><br>My recollections of the game are sketchy to say the least and that is mainly because it was one of the worst games of football I&#39;d ever seen. They adopted the same spoiling tactics. Defend deep, kick everything that moved, throw themselves about and the ball boys were in on the act too, going in slow motion any time the ball went out of play. At half time, that that nagging doubt I&#39;d had was on the verge of becoming a full blown certainty. It really looked a strong possibility that we were going out to this dreadful team. A lot of people were of the same view but we all still felt that one goal would be enough.<br><br><br><b>After the break the game continued in the same fashion. Was there a growing fear among the support that Celtic&rsquo;s glorious European run could end with a dull anti-climax?</b><br><br>As the game went on it really started to dawn on us that we were going out. We really didn&#39;t look like scoring and they weren&#39;t interested in trying to score. We were all trying to get our heads around how we could knock out Blackburn, Celta, Stuttgart and Liverpool but couldn&#39;t break down this team. It really was a dreadful game and the nerves were really starting to fray as the clocked seemed to move quicker.<br><br><br><b>But where there&rsquo;s Henrik there&rsquo;s hope. With the minutes evaporating the great man does it again. What do you remember of the goal and the celebrations it triggered? </b><br><br>I was down that half of the stand and had a fantastic view of the game. When the move started to develop we all were up because we knew there was a potential for something to happen. When it broke to the king and he stabbed it goalwards it was absolute mayhem in the stand when it hit the back of the net. Hugging, jumping about, specs/mobiles flying throught the air and general yeehahing ensued. The team, subs and staff all went totally mental too. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever been so happy at a football match as I was at that point. A brilliant, brilliant moment. It was funny to hear someone say &quot;I wonder what it&#39;s like at home right now?&quot; I knew fine well what it would be like but I bet every Celtic fan was wishing they were where we were.<br><br><br><br><b>With a first European final in 30 years so close how tense were those final minutes? </b><br><br>The last 10 minutes lasted an eternity. The clock which had been ticking down quickly now seemed to have been dropped in water. The euphoria didn&#39;t really last that long as we knew we had to see it out. All of a sudden Boavista started to play. They threw caution to the wind and started to attack. The ballboys returned the ball quickly and they looked as if they could sneak an undeserved draw. When Agathe went to ground in his own box and the guy hit the deck, my heart was in my mouth. I thought the ref would blow. Thankfully, he didn&#39;t. If they had approached the rest of the game like they did that last 10 minutes, who knows what would have transpired.<br><br><br><b>What do you remember about the final whistle? <br></b><br>The biggest street party you&#39;ve ever been to without bevvy. It was a dreadful game but the importance of the result more than made up for it. There was a huge contigent burst into tears at the whistle- not me I was way too happy- and there was hugging and high fiving with perfect strangers who at that moment were your new best mates. We could all see how much it meant to the team with Balde, Larsson, Sutton, Thompson and Lennon in particular all running about like dafties and looking like they wanted to jump into the crowd. The scarves were flying onto the pitch and the singing was brilliant.<br><br>The mobile was going mental with texts but I ignored them all at that time because I really wanted to savour these moments as they are few and far between.<br><br><b>How long did the after match party last?</b> <br><br>After the game, we all met up at the bull statue outside the main stand. We had a wee gloat at the few remaining Boavista fans. I was delighted to be wearing my Larsson T-shirt as well <img alt=":chuffed:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/t-Edgy9nDAQJ0jyvqo69jg2458" title=":chuffed:"><br><br>Sevilliano was flying straight home and he was tasked with sorting out the flights and accommodation for the UEFA Cup Final. Yes, we were all going to a European Final (well except my maw <img alt=":lol:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/0bjhQbTBtlxId4Qfxm0OTQ515" title=":lol:"> )<br><br>We walked out onto the main drag which was now wall to wall Porto fans in their cars and motorbikes flying their flags, singing their songs and laughing at their rivals. A fanatstic sight.<br><br>We went into the nearest hotel and started swallying furiously. After a while, my parents had to go as my mother was really struggling so carryondoc and I decided to head back to the riverside. And what a cracking idea that was. It was full of tims and Porto fans bevvying, singing and celebrating their respective results. I have to confess, I ended up terribly, terribly drunk.<br><br><br><b>You had just witnessed Celtic reach a European final. When did that fact really sink in and how did it feel?</b><br><br>God knows how but I can vividly remember the moment it hit home. We were standing on the street drinking outside a Porto fans bar. It was well into the we small hours. We saw Kheredine Idessane coming down the street with a camera crew. I shouted &quot;hail hail&quot; to him as I knew he was a tim. Anyway next thing he comes over sticks a microphone under my nose, the camera goes on and he asks me &quot;how does it feel to be going to a European final?&quot;. I have no idea what my reply was but I do know it was drunken gibberish. Doc gave a far more lucid answer which he was asked to repeat as they didn&#39;t get it recorded properly. Sadly, he failed miserably <img alt=":lol:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/0bjhQbTBtlxId4Qfxm0OTQ515" title=":lol:"><br><br>You won&#39;t be surprised to hear that the interviews have never been shown.<br><br>Then it was home the next afternoon and straight out on the batter again. A superb two days.<br><br>PS I didn&#39;t meet Sharpy in Seville <img alt=":cry:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/eZMLExmzsjxXZnYW_sAV9A2633" title=":cry:"></font><br></div>
