The author is well known &amp; recognised by regulars in the Celtic Internet community, and is a major contributor to TheCelticWiki site. The seventies is his major love, and this book covers the pivotal season of 1978-79 that saw Celtic win the league at the death in the famous head to head match v Rangers.<br><br>As is the norm, we are taken through the season game by game, but Stephen does a great job and avoids the pitfalls in the genre by colouring the matches with it being more than just a rehash. Interesting and entertaining anecdotes on the matches and players, social &amp; political commentary, and football stories are used to pepper the stroll through the book, giving the reader a real feel for the times. It&#39;s done so well that you can picture yourself as if you&#39;re standing there at the games. Stephen&#39;s enthusiasm for the times really comes through and makes this a pleasure. His style is a good template for all other&#39;s efforts in the same vein.<br><br>You&#39;ll read commonly about Tommy Burns and it brings to light just the impact he was having, but also that of the evolution of the new squad. Also there are the sadder tales too, including that of Ronnie Glavin&#39;s court case, and the difficult transfer from Stein to McNeill. One of the best anecdotes revolves around a meeting with Bobby Lennox which is in the acknowledgements so don&rsquo;t miss that out.<br><br>One of the big stars of the show is actually the weather, and Stephen helps to illustrate just what a strong role it played in the title decision. Thankfully the postponed games didn&#39;t derail this book as it did the season for many clubs.<br><br>The legendary 4-2 game is given a long chapter itself, and is given the due attention it deserves without some turgid repeat of old newspaper cuttings. The final chapters giving others such as players and fans a chance to describe their experiences is a terrific read.<br><br>Stephen is a gem of the online community (both podcasts and articles), and this is a wonderful tribute by him that is clearly as much a personal homage to his club as to the support. Times may have changed from those more blue collar footballing days to the more commercial game now, but the devotion is still there and this clearly shows it.<br><br>This book is a wonderful tribute to a bygone era, and is easily and breezily written that makes it a joy. I&#39;d very much recommend this book to any Celtic supporter of any age. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Product Details</h3><ul><li><b>Paperback:</b> 314 pages</li><li><b>Publisher:</b> CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform (5 Nov 2014)</li><li><b>ISBN-10:</b> 1503109747</li><li><b>ISBN-13:</b> 978-1503109742</li><li><b>     Product Dimensions:      </b>     16.5 x 1.8 x 22.9 cm     </li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>     <h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/1978" target="_self">1978</a> - <a href="/page/1979" target="_self">1979</a></li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ten-Men-Won-The-League/dp/1503109747/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415630103&sr=8-1&keywords=Ten+Men+Won+The+League" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Link</a><br></li></ul><h3>Articles</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Ten+Men+Won+The+League" target="_self">Ten Men who won the League</a></li></ul><h3>Matches</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/1979-05-21%3A+Celtic+4-2+Rangers%2C+Premier+League" target="_self">Match Page: Scottish Premier Division: Celtic 4-2 Rangers, 21 May 1979</a></li></ul></div></div><img align="bottom" alt="Books - Ten Men Won The League (2014) - The Celtic Wiki" height="395" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/e5c57f2a4126b5665f798a171ac8f34f/GW543H395" title="Books - Ten Men Won The League (2014) - The Celtic Wiki" width="543"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>     <h3>Other Reviews</h3><i>(Review of Ten Men Won The League by Celtic historian David Potter)<br></i><br>Frankly,  more books like this should be written. The fascinating story of the  1978/79 season, now 35 years ago, really should be told in the detail  that Stephen Murray has done. This was the season that climaxed of  course in the 4-2 win at Celtic Park on May 21 1979, and for most people  it is a &quot;John F Kennedy&quot; or &quot;9/11&quot; moment in that, if you weren&#39;t  there, you remember what you were doing that night - in my case,  babysitting having decked my daughter in a green babygro (I think they  are called &quot;onesies&quot; now) and having just got her to sleep before Angela  Rippon on BBC News told me the score. Second later the phone rang and  there was my incoherent father babbling on about League Champions for  the 31st time! Aye, my father is sadly no longer with us and I don&#39;t  think my daughter will fit her babygro any more... nor even her own  daughter come to think about it.<br><br>The season is dealt with month  by month, even the months of January and February when no League games  were played because of the dreadful weather. Frankly, this was not a  vintage Celtic team but it rose magnificently to the task. I had  forgotten (mercifully) about the Anglo-Scottish Cup game at Burnley with  all its hooliganism, but I remembered in detail how we were unluckily  dumped out of both Scottish trophies. I remember too a game on March 31  at Easter Road after which we all trudged home saying that this was not  to be, and that we still hadn&#39;t recovered from the cataclysmic Dalglish  transfer of 1977. This book brings back all these memories.<br><br>Stephen  worked hard in assembling all his details (I met him once in the NLS in  Edinburgh) and has produced a book which future historians will consult  in reference to this season. He has had the support of people like  Davie Provan and Danny McGrain, and thus we get all sorts of information  - Billy McNeill laying down the law to his players and demanding to be  called &quot;Boss&quot;. &quot;Any questions?&quot; asks Billy. &quot;Naw, Billy&quot; says Danny  McGrain! Davie Provan was first approached about joining Celtic by a  phone call purporting to be a journalist, but it was no less a person  than John Clark! (The crafty wee bugger!). And even for the 4-2 game,  you could still pay cash at the turnstiles. Now, if I had known that, my  mother might well have got a job babysitting that night!<br><br>The  book also is rich in details about other things - the political  situation, now known to posterity as &quot;the winter of discontent&quot;. Mrs  Thatcher quoted St Francis of Assisi in Downing Street after the  election victory, and the author is also very generous to Rangers who  actually in 1979 had one of their better seasons with a few really good  European performances. But they never won the big game on May 21. Ten  Men Did! A wonderful book, extremely entertaining and informative.  Stephen Murray, more such tomes please. 						 						 						 					<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>     <h3>Celtic Book Review: &lsquo;Ten Men Won The League&rsquo; by Stephen Murray<br></h3>07/12/2014 theshamrock1887 Leave a comment<br>http://theshamrockglasgow.wordpress.com/2014/12/07/celtic-book-review-ten-men-won-the-league-by-stephen-murray/<br><br>The 1978-9 season was a truly unique one and this book superbly captures all the drama &ndash; and fascinating detail &ndash; of an historic episode in The Celtic Story. It is unusual for a football book to be this interesting, engaging and authentic and it is an excellent example of supporter self-publishing. Often with such books either the writing quality, structure or presentation can be of dubious quality and the absence of an editor is all too evident but here Stephen Murray has produced a book which is professional in standard &ndash; and an absolute joy to read.<br><br><br>You might assume (if you are of a certain Celtic-supporting vintage) that there was little you didn&rsquo;t already know about the glorious 4-2 season. Yet, from the wreckage of Jock Stein&rsquo;s last season in charge at Celtic Park, through the notorious Winter of Discontent up until the point where Celtic were 2-1 and Johnny Doyle down to our former greatest rivals in the last game of the season with the championship slipping away, this book throws up one revelation after another: Celtic&rsquo;s transfer targets in Billy McNeill&rsquo;s first season in charge included Motherwell&rsquo;s Gregor Stevens and Willie Pettigrew; midfielder Ronnie Glavin was sent to Barlinnie during the course of an insurance fraud trial; Celtic had four goals disallowed in one game (v Montrose); you could still buy tickets from the club on the morning of the 4-2 game itself. The book is a treasure trove for Celtic fact-fiends and the detailed research on display is exceptional.<br><br><br>The structure adopted is what helps the story &ndash; and atmosphere &ndash; of the season build and build &lsquo;til its incredible conclusion. There&rsquo;s a report of every game played and the reader is taken from the depths of a 4-1 defeat at Pittrodrie to a hard fought 4-3 win at Fir Park, the club&rsquo;s embarrassing foray into the Anglo-Scottish Cup due to the absence of European football, the riot at Burnley (where the English fans chanted &lsquo;Argentina&rsquo; at the away support in reference to that summer&rsquo;s disastrous World Cup &ndash; how the times have changed!), Jock Stein&rsquo;s testimonial match against Liverpool where a wonderful 62,000 crowd turned up to show their appreciation for the great man through to Rangers&rsquo; desperate attempts to avoid a game against Celtic going ahead at Hampden soon after a debilitating European tie. Everything of note that season is touched upon between these covers.<br>The authenticity comes from the author&rsquo;s ability to recall or unearth details that only a genuine supporter would know or perhaps find of interest. That is how we are reminded of the Celtic fans chanting &ldquo;The Huns are feart to play us&rdquo; after the Hampden call-off debacle or the fans staying on after that 4-1 defeat away to Aberdeen to show they still backed the team &ndash; a show of the kind of support that Billy McNeill felt helped lift the players all the way to the title in that ultimately gruelling season. The author also recalls the significance of the last time the Celtic support would occupy the vast &lsquo;Celtic End&rsquo; terrace at the old Ibrox Park (in a game against St Mirren whose own stadium was under reconstruction) before it became an all-seater stadium, the scene of many fierce battles and cherished moments of celebration for the Celts on and off the field. These kind of memories are particular to fans, take you right back to certain times and places and also demonstrate that the author knows exactly what it was like to stand on those terracings and sing those songs.<br><br>The book also rekindles a vision of an entirely different era in football from now without falling into the nostalgia trap that many seem to. This was a time when you didn&rsquo;t need to buy a ticket in advance for most games, when most stood on terracing open to the elements and you could take unlimited amounts of alcohol into the ground with you &ndash; often resulting in bottles being sent flying towards the pitch when fans decided to vent their spleens. Aberdeen players were genuinely in fear of their safety during one controversial fixture at Celtic Park. This was also a time when commercialism was just creeping into the game and club badges had started to appear on jerseys alongside sportswear branding and sponsorship of individual matches began to take off. Margaret Thatcher came to power during the course of this season and monumental changes in society &ndash; as well as football &ndash; were just around the corner.<br><br><br>Ultimately though it is about the battle between three managers who had just taken the reins at their clubs &ndash; Billy McNeill, John Greig and Alex Ferguson in addition to Dundee United&rsquo;s Jim McLean &ndash; for one of the most competitive Scottish league campaigns in history. New faces at Celtic Park included Davie Provan and Murdo McLeod while Roy Aitken and Tommy Burns were emerging as key figures on the park. McNeill moulded them into a compact, fighting unit who remained focused on the prize despite an unimaginable fixture back log caused by months of near-Arctic conditions. This is their story and the pressure builds incessantly towards 21st May 1979. We know this because the author has been able to secure interviews with most of the Celtic team of the time &ndash; and even Gordon Smith then a striker with Rangers.<br><br><br><br>The match played between the two Glasgow clubs that evening at Celtic Park is a rare example of &ldquo;winter takes all&rdquo; in the Scottish game. Whereas there have been a few examples in recent decades of the title being decided on the final day of the season, it hasn&rsquo;t been the case that the two teams in pursuit of the title were facing off against each other. The mere thought nowadays would be enough to induce immediate diahorrhea among Scotland&rsquo;s politicians, media and (especially) police chiefs. This book builds an intense picture of the pressure felt on and off the field as well as the importance of the outcome to players, fans and management teams alike. Unsurprisingly, the final game merits a whole chapter to itself.<br><br><br>This impressive book captures everything from that season and that game with the flair of a Provan run, the commitment of a Danny McGrain tackle and the punch of a Murdo McLeod pile-driver (and fortunately it is not bloated like Peter Latchford&rsquo;s belly was at the time). It is a book that I expect to return to again and again because of the unique story expertly told as well as the statistics, pictures and quotes from those directly involved on the pitch that help bring it to life. The legend of the &ldquo;Ten Men&rdquo; and the &ldquo;4-2 game&rdquo; has never been told as well as this before.<br><br><br>The Shamrock rating: 8/10 <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>     <h3>The Spirit of 79<br></h3>http://tirnaog09.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/the-spiritof-79-it-isnt-often-ordinary.html<br><br>The Spirit of 79<br>It isn&rsquo;t often an ordinary fan such as yours truly gets the chance to visit one of the plush lounges at Celtic Park so when Stephen Murray invited me and many other Celtic fans along to the launch of his book &lsquo;Ten Men Won The League&rsquo; this week I was more than happy to oblige. It&rsquo;s always nice walking in the front doors of Celtic Park and heading upstairs past the statues, photographs and artwork which map out the history of our grand old team. An added bonus to the evening in the Jock Stein Lounge was the presence of three of the players who played such a pivotal role in that amazing 1978-79 season. Danny McGrain, rightly regarded as one of the finest players ever to wear the Hoops, graced us with his presence as did goalkeeper Peter Latchford and full back Joe Fillipi. It was pleasing to watch these guys take time to chat with fans to pose for photos and sign books. It was a lesson in humility to some of the modern highly paid players who seldom mix with ordinary supporters. The bond former Celtic players have with the Celtic supporters remains so strong because they are approachable and patient with them. The bond and indeed affection they have with each other was obvious too. I asked Peter Latchford if he remembered the game against Real Madrid in the Benabuea in 1980, he smiled and replied, &lsquo;Indeed I do, that Ref was such a homer and probably still has a place in Marbella paid for by his bung from that game.&rsquo; Danny McGrain was his usual modest self, always quick to downplay his contribution and focus on the team but anyone who saw him play knew he was a real deal. Joe Philipi, a tidy full back who never gave less than 100% was one of those gentlemen who gave the impression that just playing for Celtic was a dream come true for him. To chat to such men was a real pleasure.<br><br>Joanna Doyle was also present and that was fitting given the role her dad Johnny played in that tumultuous season. Stephen related the story told to him by Davie Provan of how Johnny Doyle went out of his way to welcome Provan to Celtic Park despite the fact that Davie was likely to push Johnny out of the first team. Provan said that Johnny Doyle remarked to him on their first meeting&hellip; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care if I&rsquo;m not in the team as long as Celtic is winning.&rsquo; Those are the words of a real Celtic man. Johnny of course is remembered in the context of that 1978-79 league campaign for foolishly being sent off in the deciding match with Rangers but his contribution throughout the season was considerable. That man would run through brick walls for Celtic and his place in the hearts of Celtic fans is assured. One can imagine his anguish sitting alone in the Celtic Park dressing room listening to the roars of the crowd and wondering if he had blown it for his team. A ball boy apparently rushed in at full time to tell him that Celtic had won 4-2. Johnny almost hugged him to death. A true Celt and a man we miss still.<br><br><br>Being of a certain vintage I have vivid memories of Celtic fighting their way from a seemingly impossible position that season to find themselves facing Rangers in a game on which everything hinged. Hollywood script writers couldn&rsquo;t have come up with a scenario as exciting and climatic as that astonishing game at Celtic Park. The drama and passion of that famous night in May 1979 will be forever etched into the memory of all who witnessed it but as Stephen points out so well in his book it took a gargantuan effort by Celtic to claw their way back into contention and set up that thrilling finale. The long, snowy winter of 1978-79 saw Celtic without a game for 10 weeks. When spring returned they had to cram in games at such a rate that you felt sure they&rsquo;d crack and lose form. They didn&rsquo;t and Stephen traces the incredible consistency of the team in the last three months of the season which saw them rise like a phoenix and shoot up the league table. There were late winning goals, dramatic incidents and odd occurrences like Celtic beating St Mirren at Ibrox on a Friday night!<br><br>As you read the book you get a real sense that Stephen&rsquo;s viewpoint on events comes from a fan&rsquo;s perspective. This is a Celtic man, an east end Bhoy pouring his heart into his writing. There are fascinating interviews and quotes from players involved such as Mike Conroy and even former Rangers player Gordon Smith but the prose overflows with Stephen&rsquo;s enthusiasm and affection for Celtic. It&rsquo;s hard to capture and distil the drama and sheer excitement of what occurred at Celtic Park on a bright May evening 35 years ago but Stephen does it superbly. He captures the excitement of a game which seemed to have everything as it bubbled and boiled to an astonishing finale as well as the scenes of unbridled and fairly chaotic joy on the terraces, pitch and changing rooms. His description of the injured Tommy Burns standing on top of the small wall at the front of the Director&rsquo;s box belting out &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll never walk alone&rsquo; with tens of thousands of other Celts brought a tear to my eye. God how that man loved Celtic!<br><br><br>As a boy you hear tell from your older relatives of great Celtic games like Lisbon or the 7-1 game and wonder if you&rsquo;ll see such times yourself. That league clinching victory against Rangers in May 1979 was simply stunning in its intensity, atmosphere and significance. It was all the more amazing because Celtic had a mid-season loss of form which would have killed off any other side&rsquo;s hopes of being champions. Few gave thought Celtic could be champions that year as they languished in mid-table at Christmas 1978 but as the snow fell and continued to fall that winter a very different Celtic was being moulded by Manager Billy McNeil. This Celtic was organised, hungry and ready to defy the odds stacked against them. To their eternal credit, they refused to give up and through grit, skill and sheer will power fought their way to the title.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of Celtic books but few have filled with pride and reminded me of what our club and its supporters are capable of in the manner this one does. Any Celt who witnessed these events should read Stephen&rsquo;s book and relive some quite astonishing times. For those of you too young to have seen these events unfold the book will give you a window into the recent history of our incredible club and demonstrate that that passion and commitment we see today is not a new invention. It&rsquo;s been there since 1888. Mike Conroy, now coaching in Ireland recounts his emotions at full time by saying&hellip;<br><br>&lsquo;I practically jumped into the Jungle at the final whistle. I took off my boots and threw them into the Jungle. I was trying to get my strip off when Johannes Edvaldsson jumped on me and said, &lsquo;Haw calm down, calm down.&rsquo; I was going to throw my jersey in but I&rsquo;m glad now because I still have it. I&rsquo;ve played in better Celtic teams than that one but I&rsquo;ve never played in a team or been in a dressing room that had that spirit about it.&rsquo;<br><br>Those of you lucky enough to see Celtic&rsquo;s phoenix like rise from third bottom of the SPL to becoming Champions on that amazing evening will never forget it. The spirit of 79 was incredible and Stephen has managed to give a great account of how it developed and drove Celtic on to one of their most famous and unlikely victories. It makes me proud just thinking about it.<br><br><br>Postscript<br><br>As we I headed back to the Garngad after that game in May 1979 we sang ourselves hoarse. Even as a skinny young lad I knew I&rsquo;d seen a game we&rsquo;d talk about for years. Celtic fans we passed joined our songs, hugged us and beamed with utter delight. The Garngad was buzzing when we got home. Flags hung out of windows and songs of victory echoed long into the night. I awoke the following morning with a smile on my face that took a week to fade. That&rsquo;s the way it gets you when you let Celtic become a part of you. You live it, breathe it, love it. &lsquo;We are the Champions&rsquo; we sang over and over that night and I&rsquo;m happy to report I&rsquo;ve sung it many times since.<br><br>God Bless the Celts and every last one of you who loves the green!<br><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Books - Ten Men Won The League (2014) - The Celtic Wiki" height="1303" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/b9a01dd3daecefeede342b17d909b198/GW1024H1303" title="Books - Ten Men Won The League (2014) - The Celtic Wiki" width="1024"><br></div>
