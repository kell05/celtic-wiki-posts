and spirits were lifted when Porto suffered an early injury  setback. <br><br>                             Influential midfielder Francisco Costinha collapsed making a pass and  was stretchered off with a thigh injury. <br><br>                             Porto had the first half&#39;s most influential performer in striker Deco,  who was a constant threat to the Celtic defence. <br><br>                             He forced Joos Valgaeren into a tackle which earned the defender a  booking, then forced a fine diving save from Rab Douglas four minutes  before the interval. <br><br>                             Celtic&#39;s response was muted, with Larsson&#39;s long-range free-kick the  only serious threat to Vitor Baia. <br><br>                             Porto deservedly took the lead in first-half injury time -

with the so-called &quot;silver goal&quot;  decider - passed without serious opportunities for either side. <br><br>                             But Porto were back in front with five minutes left when Derlei  collected a loose ball to fire past the stranded Douglas. <br><br>                             Porto&#39;s Nuno Valente was also sent off for a second bookable offence in  the closing seconds, but by then Celtic&#39;s challenge had been snuffed  out. <br><br>                                                        <b>                            Celtic:                            </b>                             Douglas, Balde, Mjallby, Valgaeren (Laursen 64), Agathe,  Lennon, Lambert (McNamara 76), Petrov (Maloney 104), Thompson, Sutton,  Larsson.                            <br>                             Subs Not Used: Hedman, Sylla, Fernandez, Smith.

It is a far more &quot;Spanish&quot; city than Barcelona or even  Madrid, despite the obvious Moorish influence, in that it is relatively  untarnished by the effects of tourism and a cosmopolitan population. <br><br>                             So how, I wondered, would it look draped in green, white and gold? <br><br>                 </div>                                                                                                                                                                                                    <div class="bo">                                    	 Well, not too bad as it turns out. The 15th century cathedral has become  a focal point for the followers of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s men- or, rather,  the Irish pub Flaherty&#39;s across the road has become the focal point and  the cathedral provides an interesting backdrop.<br><br>                             On arriving on Monday night, more than 48 hours before kick-off, there  were already a couple of thousand Celtic fans drinking and partying in  this particular &quot;zona&quot; with many more ensconced in other Irish bars  elsewhere in the city. <br><br>                             By Tuesday morning, the same was still true. Many, it seemed, had not  been to bed. But they had, only their bed was the concrete steps of the  cathedral. <br><br>                             For this Celtic band are a hardy bunch. Alright, so sleeping rough in  Seville may not be the hardship that a similar experience in the pouring  rain of Glasgow would provide, but it still gets cold at night and many  of these guys had no more than their short-sleeved Celtic jerseys to  keep them warm. <br><br>                             One family I spoke to had spent the night sleeping outside the railway  station. Not only that, but they have no tickets for the game, which  surely makes that penance all the greater. <br><br>                 </div>                                                                                                                                                                                                    <div class="bo">                                    	 The Murphys, from Fife, were still trying desperately to get a hold of  tickets for Wednesday night&#39;s game.<br><br>                             &quot;I was offered a ticket for 700 Euros,&quot; said Brendan. &quot;But you&#39;ve got to  be wary of forgeries.&quot; <br><br>                             Nonetheless, they were not complaining and, like many others, they were  here not only for the festivities but to sample the local culture as  well. <br><br>                             &quot;We tried to get into the cathedral to say a prayer when we arrived, but  it was closed, so we&#39;re going in when it opens this morning,&quot; said  Thomas. <br><br>                             &quot;It&#39;s some place and the locals have been great.&quot; <br><br>                             The Murphys&#39; mother is joining her family in Seville on Wednesday. &quot;She  broke her hip a few weeks ago, so she&#39;s coming out with her stick.

But, with most Celtic fans yet to arrive, he admitted that even that  occasion would be dwarved. <br><br>                             So Celtic fans have embraced Seville and the city seems to quite like  them too.

This was a performance that deserved more than a collection of runner-up  medals. <br><br>                             Celtic&#39;s display was courageous and spirited - the performance of a team  of winners. <br><br>                             This despite an intense heat that scarcely dipped below oppressive - and  that was just in the stands.<br></div><div class="bo">                                                       The first half was unremarkable and Porto perhaps deserved their narrow  lead. <br><br>                             But the second half was nothing short of astonishing as twice Celtic  equalised after it seemed Porto had done enough by edging ahead. <br><br>                             All this at a pace that defied the sizzling temperature and a long  season that has been extended by this remarkable Uefa Cup run. <br><br>                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                            	 Even when the game went into extra time and Bobo Balde was ordered off,  Celtic&#39;s energy levels remained high and it seemed that the 10 men might  hold out and take the game to penalties.<br><br>                             Porto played the better football on a pitch that had been heavily  criticised beforehand, correctly so, for it did not do justice to an  occasion such as this. <br><br>                             Few could deny them the trophy, but it is difficult to feel anything  other than deep sympathy for the legions of Celtic fans who made the  journey to Spain from far and wide. <br><br>                             Their support was truly magnificent throughout, although they stopped  short of applauding the winners, after the game was soured by a series  of dives and over-reactions by the Portuguese players.                                                          This was the one sour note, for a team as talented as Porto should not  need to resort to such tactics. <br><br>                 </div>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <div class="bo">                                                       But that is the way of the modern game and it has become a new method of  gaining the advantage over less wily opposition. <br><br>                             So, this was a disappointing finale to an historic cup run, but the  Celtic players have taken a huge step on behalf of Scottish football,  which has so long been in the European doldrums. <br><br>                             It is to be hoped that both Celtic and Rangers can follow this  achievement by making an impression on next season&#39;s Champion&#39;s League. <br><br>                             Othewise, all of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s men&#39;s efforts may have been in vain,  and that would be an even greater disappointment. <br><br>                 </div>      Story from BBC SPORT:<br> http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/europe/3048881.stm<br> <br> Published: 2003/05/22 00:01:10 GMT<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="headline"><h3>     No silver lining for Larsson   </h3></div>                                                                                                                    	By Alasdair Lamont in Seville                                                                                <br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <div class="bo">                          <b>                            Swedish striker Henrik Larsson insists his two-goal haul was no  consolation for Celtic&#39;s Uefa Cup final defeat in Seville.<br><br></b>                                                                                     Larsson scored both goals as the Bhoys twice battled back from behind  and his performance was hailed as &quot;world class&quot;

To play  as well as he did and still finish up on the losing side is quite  unbelievable. <br><br>                             Unfortunately the game wasn&#39;t played in the best of spirits.

The 15th century cathedral has become  a focal point for the followers of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s men- or, rather,  the Irish pub Flaherty&#39;s across the road has become the focal point and  the cathedral provides an interesting backdrop.<br><br>                             On arriving on Monday night, more than 48 hours before kick-off, there  were already a couple of thousand Celtic fans drinking and partying in  this particular &quot;zona&quot; with many more ensconced in other Irish bars  elsewhere in the city. <br><br>                             By Tuesday morning, the same was still true. Many, it seemed, had not  been to bed. But they had, only their bed was the concrete steps of the  cathedral. <br><br>                             For this Celtic band are a hardy bunch. Alright, so sleeping rough in  Seville may not be the hardship that a similar experience in the pouring  rain of Glasgow would provide, but it still gets cold at night and many  of these guys had no more than their short-sleeved Celtic jerseys to  keep them warm. <br><br>                             One family I spoke to had spent the night sleeping outside the railway  station. Not only that, but they have no tickets for the game, which  surely makes that penance all the greater. <br><br>                 </div>                                                                                                                                                                                                    <div class="bo">                                    	 The Murphys, from Fife, were still trying desperately to get a hold of  tickets for Wednesday night&#39;s game.<br><br>                             &quot;I was offered a ticket for 700 Euros,&quot; said Brendan. &quot;But you&#39;ve got to  be wary of forgeries.&quot; <br><br>                             Nonetheless, they were not complaining and, like many others, they were  here not only for the festivities but to sample the local culture as  well.<br>                                                          &quot;We tried to get into the cathedral to say a prayer when we arrived, but  it was closed, so we&#39;re going in when it opens this morning,&quot; said  Thomas. <br><br>                             &quot;It&#39;s some place and the locals have been great.&quot; <br><br>                             The Murphys&#39; mother is joining her family in Seville on Wednesday. &quot;She  broke her hip a few weeks ago, so she&#39;s coming out with her stick.
