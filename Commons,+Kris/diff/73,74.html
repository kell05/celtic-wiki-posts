His appeal goes beyond just the role of honour of silverware and goal statistics, and we are proud of just how much from his introduction to the club that he had chosen to immerse in the whole culture.<br><br>A former Notts County youth, Commons - who can play either in the wing  or as an advanced attacking central midfielder - started his  professional career at Stoke City before moving on a Bosman to Forest in  2004. A four-year stay at the City Ground ended in controversy when he  left the Reds - again on a free - for local rivals Derby. Rated as one  of the most gifted players in the Championship, the midfielder hit 21  goals in 80 appearances for the Rams before finally quitting the  midlands to head to Glasgow. <br><br>Although born in Nottinghamshire,  Commons qualified to play for Scotland through the grandparent ruling.  He scored his first goal in seven appearances for his country in the 3-0  friendly win over the Faroe Islands at Pittodrie in November 2010.<br><br><b>Lennon Years</b><br>Kris Commons moved to Parkhead in January 2011 after Celtic paid a reported &pound;300,000 to seal the switch from English Championship side Derby County.   <br><br>The talented midfielder joined Neil Lennon&#39;s Bhoys just days after Rangers had publically declared that they were in advanced negotiations with the player. But the Mansfield-born Commons would deny he was ever on the verge of a move to Ibrox, claiming that, despite the proclamations of Rangers staff, contact with the Govan club had been minimal. Appears to be just bluster from the Huns, best ignored and laughed at.<br><br>Commons insisted that once Celtic&#39;s interest in him became clear there was only ever going to be one winner in the race for his signature and on January 27th the player signed a deal which tied him to Parkhead for the next 3-and-a-half-years. Despite being a Scotland international Commons, having spent his entire career thus far in England&#39;s Championship and League One, remained an unknown quantity to many Hoops fans. But they didn&#39;t have to wait long for a glimpse of the talent their team had acquired.<br><br>The midfielder made his Bhoys debut on January 29th in the CIS Cup semi-final against Aberdeen at Hampden. With the game just six minutes old Commons collected the ball on the edge of the area and, displaying sublime technique and vision, he sent a looping chip over the keeper and into the far corner of the net. That goal was the highlight of a fine debut performance and a goal at Rangers in a 2-2 Scottish Cup draw a fortnight later confirmed further the growing feeling among the support that in the ex-Derby man they had captured a top quality player. <br><br>Commons reinforced this belief by scoring again in the 3-0 victory over Rangers on the 20th of February to make a dream start of 3 goals in just 5 games, an incredible statistic for a midfielder. By the end of his debut campaign, he had found the net 14 times within 21 matches. Extraordinary considering that he had been signed mid-way through the season.<br><br>He also became possibly the first player to score on his debut matches (at club level) at Celtic Park, Ibrox &amp; Hampden. He had started with a bang, and on the pitch he had very well slotted in and was entertaining and providing firepower.<br><img align="right" alt="Commons, Kris - Pic" height="202" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/1nQ4qQrllqYbuTr3hWRMag33081/GW376H202" title="Commons, Kris - Pic" width="376"><br>While Commons&#39; qualities had come as a surprise to some of the Celtic support, his talent was well known to Parkhead boss Lennon. The Irishman had been a long-time admirer of the man who he had briefly played beside at Nottingham Forest. Knowing that Commons&#39; contract at Pride Park was set to run out in the summer Lennon seized the chance to grab a bargain and Celtic were able to strike a cut-price deal for a player who had previously been valued at around &pound;3.5 million. <br><br>Should be noted that he had his difficult points too as was reflected in the next season. 2011/2012 season was more difficult for various reasons, and mutterings arose about Commons having a spat with manager Lennon, with many in belief that his time at Celtic was close to end. It was all exaggerated and Commons treated it as a joke turning up one day at training fully bandaged up. All took in jest and lightened the mood, and it became a PR positive with the fans seeing the funny side too despite the then low morale. It was though his only poor season at Celtic, and he managed just the one goal that season, albeit against Rangers in a 3-0 win, catching them out in their last ever game, strking a wonderful shot. That time was all an exception, and he was back on form there after.<br><br>After that poor season, it was back on form, and Celtic were to be repaid for their faith in him. <br><br>Playing in what can be best described as a playmaker role, in this increasingly tactically driven game he had a lot more on his broad shoulders. He carried it well, although too often the first team over-relied on him. His goal catch was invaluable and too often got the misfiring front line off the hook. Commons was a driving force, and the others should have copied his work ethic. The appreciative support loved him. <br><br>  Kris was simply the most intelligent footballer in the squad that Celtic had. He may not have been the fastest, and will never have XBox superstar stats on the football console games, but he understood how games are won and was able to act accordingly. This was invaluable and he became a bulwark in the side that made us forget about the loss of various key players over the years like Wanyama, Hooper et al. He was excellent in possession and led by example (even more so many a time than captain Scott Brown).  <br><br>He wasn&#39;t afraid to take responsibility either, and had the bottle to take crucial penalties, none more so than the winning penalty against Spartak Moscow that took Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League in 2012/13. Granted it was a woeful penalty that put your heart in your mouth, but it still converted though his technique needed working on. It took iron guts to take it and sent the support into raptures. <br><br>His finest season was in 2013/14 which saw him come to the fore more than ever. The side seemed to lack a leader and the front line was abysmal, yet Commons stepped up and put the strikers in the shade. The side if anything became over reliant on him, but his goals were high quality and he was working for the side and the club. He ended up being pushed to a more strikers role than a midfielder role now to take advantage of this form. He even scored the pivotal first goal against Shakter Karagandy that propelled the side to turn around a 2-0 deficit to win 3-0 to get into the Champions League.<br><br>Commons was also making a name for himself with the bookies. You wanted a cert? Commons for first goal! <br><br>The curious point was how come he had a greater striker&#39;s instinct than our overpaid forwards? It was frustrating and what if he were out the side? As it proved in the 2-1 Scottish Cup defeat to Aberdeen in Feb 2014, if Commons was off form for a day then the team were to collapse. It was our first domestic defeat for months and our first conceded goals too. The others needed to take the pressure off of him, but no one was stepping up till Griffiths arrived. <br><br>It is not an exageration to say in retrospect that he carried the first team for a season or two. He was that pivotal.<br><br>Commons really cared, he could be a hard task master with his fellow players. After the loss to Juventus, he was not afraid to make a criticism at his fellow players if he felt they let the side down. Two edged sword, but reflected just how much it meant to him and the side needed this. It became quite obvious that he would in time be suited to take up some role in coaching at Celtic.<br><br>To everyone&#39;s joy and amazement, in July 2014, Kris Commons was named as one of 35 players recognised in Uefa&rsquo;s Best Player in Europe award for 2013-14 for his prolific campaign for the club last season. It was a wonderful achievement and due recognition of his worth. <br><br><b>Post-Lennon</b><br>Curiously, things fell apart once Lennon left as manager and Deila settled in (season 2014-15). From early on, Deila appeared to not favour Commons and even in crunch games Commons was not in the first team. Those most critical of the manager would say that this was a major factor in what was a shambles of the start for Deila as Celtic lurched from one disaster to another. On the other hand, Commons was ageing, and in those games he played he was a declining force yet still worthy of opportunities. You could see the effort but not the same impact. His requests for a longer contract were falling on deaf ears with the club only offering a shorter term. <br><br>Commons was a popular figure with the support and after much uncertainty over his future, he signed on for longer in 2014-15. He was still valuable but the swagger wasn&#39;t there like it once was. He had value as a squad player and team motivator. A very public bust up in a match when substituted by Deila saw him fined for his touchline reaction, and it signalled the end for him under Deila. On the other hand, it was another sign of Deila&#39;s inability to handle the first team and another step to the manager&#39;s inevitable resignation to come. Deila was out of his depth, and Commons was never the hardest player to manage.<br><br>Rumours every transfer window began to circle about an upcoming move away, but he remained and deep down everyone was happy with this. <br><br>With the arrival of Brendan Rodgers (2016), Commons was out the picture. A successful influx of early transfers and revitalised midfielders meant that finally the first team could look to beyond the over reliance on Commons that had been the case for many years previously. <br><br>Commons was finally sent out on loan to Hibs in Dec 2016 having not played a First XI game for around 9 months, and it really finally sealed his departure from Celtic. Age, wear and tear meant it was time to move on, as was that finally Celtic had found a set of players that were of a high quality that removed the need for the prior over-reliance on Commons. The only irony is that he was moving to Hibs who were now managed by former manager Neil Lennon, so it buried the notion that the two had any sort of rift. <br><br>He summarised his time well as he left to move to Hibs on loan: <br><div><blockquote><i>&ldquo;Listen, I never want  to leave Celtic. They will have to kick me out the door. Once my  contract is up, that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s going to be. I&rsquo;ve spent six of the  best years of my career at Celtic, winning trophies, winning a player of  the year award. For me it has been an absolute roller-coaster ride that  I don&rsquo;t want to get off.&quot;<br></i></blockquote></div><b><br><br>Retrospective<br></b>Commons shouldn&#39;t be overlooked, and the first team owes him a debt. It shouldn&#39;t be discounted just how good a signing he was and how important a player he was for Celtic. He arguably could&#39;ve gone a year earlier for his own sake but the squad needed him and it was worthwhile keeping hold of him as a back-up. <br><br>Not many players score near 100 goals for Celtic, and those that do are fondly remembered; Kris Commons will not be the exception to the rule. A man who helped the first team win Leagues, scored 30+ goals in a season, was a regular hunskelper and chipped in with some very important European goals (e.g. goals v Spartak &amp; Elfsbord). He was a fine player - who while lacking a bit of acceleration - had great awareness of the game, could play some great passes and had a brilliant ability to hit the target from distance.<br><br>He gave us some very fine moments which for the little he cost will go down in the annuls of Celtic time to rank him as one of the best value for money signings in the club&#39;s history.   <br><br>When you watch back his haul of goals &amp; assists, he was involved in some magnificent goals, including scoring some exceptional long-range goals. He was a wonderful shot-taker, one of the best for shots from outside the box. A bit of a hunskelper too, and he will be remembered as the first Celtic player to have scored against both Rangers and then the zombie Sevco entity too.<br><br>One aspect that became apparent was how settled he and his family became immersed in Glasgow life. His partner was heavily involved in local charity aspects (partly in reflection of the premature death at birth of one of their children (RIP)), and they were well loved in the city. He and his family had grown to become part of the city&#39;s football life &amp; social culture. They embodied all that was best of Celtic. Both he and his family totally got Celtic and the support totally got them too.  His wife was very prominent amongst the supporters at the ground level in a genuine and humbling effort that really was heart-warming. We will miss her as much as Commons.<br><br>Commons in retrospectives will be very warmly talked about. As a person on and off the pitch he was a bit of a model for many. He worked hard, drove the first team and helped foster a good relationship with the fans. His goals were often vital and invaluable. He was one of the best value purchases Celtic had made this decade. He may not have had the panache and star quality of various others, but that would miss the point of his true worth. <br><br>You can just look at his list of silverware and wax lyrical about his success at Celtic, but he was a key achiever in the winning of each of those medals, and really it reflects as much a value of both him as a person off the pitch as on the pitch which made him a Celtic favourite.<br><br>We wish him the best, and we know we will certainly see him again at Celtic in some capacity.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5

At 30,  the penny drops, but his goal return this season has been good and he&#39;s  so important for us. He&#39;s got three, four, five good years still in him  and he&#39;s getting better.

At the present moment there is one stand-out candidate. Celtic&rsquo;s midfield ace Kris Commons has bagged an incredible 21 goals for the Glasgow giants so far this season. In this article, I take a look back over Kris Commons time in Scottish Football, his Celtic career so far and speculate on what the future may hold for Celtic&rsquo;s mercurial midfielder.<br><br>When Kris Commons arrived at Celtic as part of a &pound;300,000 move from Derby County, there was very little fanfare and there was something understated about his arrival. There was no great excitement from any large, detectable portion of the Paradise faithful. The only real discussion taking place around the signing of Commons was centered around the fact that the Glasgow mainstream sports media had been reporting in the week prior to (Commons signing for Celtic) that Rangers had been sniffing around Commons with the intention of making an offer. Some outlets reported that transfer fees and contract terms had been discussed between Commons representatives and a negotiation team from Rangers. So with Commons seemingly choosing Celtic over Rangers, it generated a slightly spicier atmosphere around Commons signing.<br><br>But like so much when Scottish Football, the media and Rangers are involved, the reality may actually have been very different. Speaking at a press conference in January 2011, Kris was pressed by a member of the gathered sports media to reveal why he had knocked back Rangers and signed for Celtic instead. Commons seemed bemused and almost confused by the question and quickly replied: &ldquo;I think it was mainly talk from yourselves. There was no talk from our side. The things that went in the press &ndash; the wages, the money &ndash; was all nonsense.&rdquo;<br><br>A cynic might say this was less about Kris Commons knocking back Rangers and more about some members of the press kindly linking Rangers with a move for Commons to simulate transfer activity from the Ibrox club. I know, the thought of a member of the mainstream media being a bit friendly with Walter Smith &amp; doing some light PR to make Rangers appear &ldquo;busy&rdquo; in the transfer market might sound like deranged paranoia to some, but had Rangers been as serious on the transfer as the press insinuated at the time, then Commons could have been a Rangers player before Celtic even expressed an interest. This was not to pass and not only did Kris Commons suggest there was no actual or tangible discussions between him and Rangers but he quickly signed for Celtic with very little fuss.<br><br>Commons made his debut for Celtic in a CIS cup semi final against Aberdeen. He quickly scored with a fantastic chip &ndash; chipping the ball over the heads of goalkeepers would become something of a signature technique for Commons &ndash; and he revealed the level of technical proficiency and vision that would come to separate him from his peers over the coming seasons. Kris followed up his sublime goal in the cup by scoring in his Old Firm debut against Rangers at Ibrox in a 2-2 draw. Goals and assists against Rangers were always a priority for a Celtic attacker when Rangers were playing in the top flight of Scottish football. His great goalscoring form continued as Commons netted another goal and importantly, added another Old Firm goal to his already bulging account by scoring in a 3-0 win against Rangers. The midfielder finished the season with an impressive 14 goals &amp; 6 assists in only 21 appearances. Seldom does a January signing participate in the second half of the season with the same devastating effect that Commons had displayed.<br><br>It seemed that the short and portly midfielder could come in very handy in the 10/11 title race with his creative play and desirable habit of producing an &ldquo;end product&rdquo; which would be invaluable in the quest for a title that had eluded Celtic the previous two seasons. Ultimately, it was not to be for Kris and Celtic that season. Celtic capitulated at Inverness and despite Commons scoring in that game, they went on to lose the match and then later, the title. Walter Smith&rsquo;s men had clung to the SPL title and completed three titles in a row. Many Rangers fans selected Commons as a target for their gloating. &ldquo;Bet ye wish ye donned yer brogues and joined Rangers noo!?&rdquo;. It would prove, as it so often does, that those who laugh last would in fact laugh the longest.<br><br>Commons got off to an unfortunate start the following season when injury, and therefore fitness, impeded his season from the off. He ended the season with only one goal. But how typical of football that the one goal came against Celtic&rsquo;s Glasgow city rivals Rangers. Celtic had been struggling until midway through that season. Languishing dangerously far behind Ally McCoist&rsquo;s steadfast Rangers side as far into the campaign as November. There was many who questioned Neil Lennon and his Celtic side&rsquo;s ability to come back from a large points deficit &ndash; I believe it was 15 points at its largest &ndash; and wrestle the title from a Rangers side dining out on their three in a row credentials. Celtic then mounted a spectacular comeback and sat ahead of Rangers coming out of December. Commons and Celtic went on to win the title as their unfortunate and once-proud rivals plunged into administration.<br><br>The 2012/2013 season saw Celtic go on to have one of their best seasons and go on a historic European run that culminated in a last 16 appearance in the top club competition in Europe &ndash; The UEFA Champions League. Not only did Commons play an important part in Celtic&rsquo;s win over Barcelona but also the run to the elite 16, by weighing in with two goals and three assists over the European campaign.<br><br>One of these goals being a penalty against Spartak Moscow that secured Celtic&rsquo;s qualification from the Champions League group stages. It requires a special kind of nerve and a different breed of professional athlete to maintain such solid composure in such a high pressure situation. Commons not only maintained his composure but also exhibited fantastic technique to convert the penalty without fuss. The left footed midfielder also played his part domestically and finished the season with a record of 46 games played, 19 goals scored and 17 assists. Common&rsquo;s vision, intellect and ruthless execution from midfield was starting to mature into being of consistent value to Celtic.<br><br>The 2013/2014 season has seen Commons evolve into an entirely different level of player. His consistency across a season uninterrupted by injury and without a blemish on his disciplinary record is now the perfect platform to showcase his maturity as a pivotal player for his club. It may seem obvious that a player going from Derby County to competing against the likes of Barcelona, Ajax, Spartak Moscow, AC Milan and Juventus is going to improve as a result of the experience, but what Commons is showing now, is another type of evolution entirely.<br><br>Commons is currently sitting on 21 goals in 32 games. Such impressive goalscoring form from a midfield position is a comodity that is rare in football at the moment.<br><br>Celtic have struggled to find a consistent striking partnership or effectively replace Gary Hooper so far in the 2013/2014 season. With this, a goal drought among the present strikers could have caused Celtic much discomfort even domestically. Commons has stepped up to the mark and filled in the gap that an out-and-out striker should be filling. The increase in Commons&rsquo; goals has also seen a decrease in his assist rate. However, this is misleading and is, in fact, simply a by-product of the fact he has taken the goal scoring initiative up himself. He can hardly assist himself and is simply using his footballing intellect to help spark moves which allow the team to create opportunities for him. It is subtle, but very smart. There has been rumours and hearsay emanating from Celtic Park over the last two seasons which suggest Kris Commons could be ear-marked for a coaching role if he stays to finish his career at Celtic. When you watch the intelligence with which Commons plays the game it is hardly any type of surprise.<br><br>Commons has been the stand alone candidate for the Player of the Year Awards with the only conceivable challenge coming from the media darling, and reborn Kilmarnock striker, Kris Boyd. The simple fact is that Boyd is in a position that allows him to do what he should be doing, which is scoring goals. Commons has to set the move in motion and then calculate how to best manoeuvre himself to advance into a position to finalise the move and convert the opportunity. This is very hard to do and Commons has made this seem routine over the season thus far.<br><br>Kris Commons is getting to live every footballer&rsquo;s dream at the moment. He is in the form of his life. Scoring breathtaking goals on a weekly basis and also having the comfort of knowing he will be competing against Europe&rsquo;s elite clubs each season. He has the adulation and support of a huge global fanbase who have watched him grow and develop as a player and a professional. The most spectacular thing about Kris Commons time at Celtic, is his integration with the wider support network that Celtic generate, known to some as &ldquo;The Celtic Family&rdquo;. Kris and his family are very active around fundraising and raising awareness of various charities and this draws much appreciation on social media like Twitter and various other internet forums.<br><br>Kris has not only brought much success to Celtic, but Kris and his partner, Lisa Hague, have brought the most precious success into their own lives. They have had children and watched them grow and all under the watchful gaze of the wider Celtic support. Lisa, is not only a successful businesswoman in her own right and a proud &amp; doting mother, but she also engages with the club&rsquo;s supporters and seems at ease with the charitable sp
