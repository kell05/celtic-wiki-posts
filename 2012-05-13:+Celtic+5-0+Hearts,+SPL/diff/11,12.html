But after downing tools for St Johnstone and Dundee Utd  games, I&#39;d hoped we&#39;d save one last performance for trophy day and the  team didn&#39;t disappoint. Probably says it all about the way we took to  the game, the workrate and invention of our midfield and attack  throughout, that all five of Hooper&#39;s goals were close to being tap-ins,  with the exception of him taking the scenic route round the keeper when  I thought he was briefly in two minds about a wee chip. First Celtic in  40 odd years to bag five, a feat beyond even such luminaries as  McAvennie, Larsson, and Brattbakk.<br><br>Thought Celtic&#39;s stage  managing of the celebrations were a bit shampoo, to be honest, again  taking into account the weather. Repeating those cheesy big screen  introductions again when the team came out to collect the trophy only  resulted in weird silences and the occasional laugh. In the miserable  weather there was a kinda unspoken vibe that nobody wanted to admit out  loud, ffs, just get on wi it. ; )<br><br>Up the road to watch a quite  incredible Man City - QPR game on Sky+ and as their fans were blubbering  away and fearing the worst I said to Daleybhoy they were basically  going through what we would have suffered had George O&#39;Boyle not headed  over the bar of an open goal from three yards out in May 1998. But nice  to see a change of scenery down there (though I was already chuckling at  the prospect of Ferguson somehow, again, making his haters the fuwious  ones).<br><br>Now to sit down and try and properly catch up on whatever  the eff has gone down in the last 48 hours at the huns, the Sundays&#39;  skewering of the BK and Sir Dodgy&#39;s latest excuse-ridden diktat to his  house magazine. Pissing rain and wind aside a fine end to a brilliant  season which we can now begin to properly reflect on for our own part,  whilst the hun fallout looks destined to take a few entertaining twists  yet as they hurtle inexorably in the one direction regardless. And as a  last wee bonus the hammering today might have knocked Jambo confidence  just that bit enough to make their SC final vs the Hibees a bit more of a  contest, but I can&#39;t see it, Hibs are shocking, and the mini huns have  owned them for donkeys now anyway, they&#39;ll probably canter it.<br><br>Lenny&#39;s  sitting the trophy at the GB corner then walking off and leaving them  with it (so to speak) was a genius touch, brilliant stuff (even if  someone did get nervous and have an official along to nab it pronto).  Mibbe the couple of lads on here who were explaining they widnae join in  when others sang his name, cos of the principle n&#39;at, can finally put  the pish from the Udinese game to bed. That was a huge gesture that I&#39;ve  seen few, if any, title-winning managers in leagues around the world do  for a section of their support. A well-deserved moment of the GB&#39;s own  in all the celebrations, one to tell the grandkids - the day the Celtic  manager laid the championship trophy at our feet.<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="2012-05-13: Celtic 5-0 Hearts, SPL - Pic" height="665" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/5dUgwXDkQe9YLQ0ZRec_9Q562011/GW1000H665" title="2012-05-13: Celtic 5-0 Hearts, SPL - Pic" width="1000"><br><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><h3>  Celtic</h3>01 Forster<br>03 Izaguirre<br>21 Mulgrew<br>22 Loovens<br>02 Matthews<br>08 Brown Booked (Kayal - 67&#39; )<br>16 Ledley (McCourt - 69&#39; )<br>67 Wanyama<br>09 Samaras<br>15 Commons (Stokes - 81&#39; )<br>88 Hooper<br><br><b>Substitutes</b><br>24 Zaluska<br>11 Cha Du-Ri<br>23 Lustig<br>56 Twardzik<br>20 McCourt<br>33 Kayal<br>10 Stokes<br><br><b>Goals</b><br><ul><li>  Hooper 5&prime;, 8&prime;, 39&prime;, 66&prime;, 87&prime;  </li></ul><br><h3>Heart of Midlothian</h3>30 MacDonald<br>03 Grainger Booked<br>06 Webster (Barr - 83&#39; )<br>17 McGowan<br>26 Zaliukas<br>12 Templeton<br>21 Taouil (Prychynenko - 25&#39; )<br>31 Mrowiec<br>18 Novikovas (Holt - 46&#39; )<br>23 Glen<br>27 Robinson<br><br><b>Substitutes</b><br>28 Ridgers<br>05 Barr<br>07 Santana<br>11 Driver<br>19 Skacel<br>35 Prychynenko<br>42 Holt<br><br><b>Ref</b>: Muir<br><b>Att</b>: 58,875    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  Match Report (see end of page below)</li><li class="MsoNormal"><a class="external" href="http://celticfanmedia.com/WPC-edit-content/uploads/2017/02/PR-2012-05-13-Hearts.mp3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Audio Report: Paradise Report</a></li></ul>  <h3>  Pictures </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a href="/page/2012-05-13%3A+Celtic+5-0+Hearts%2C+SPL+-+Pictures" target="_self">Match Pictures </a></li></ul>  <h3>  Forum</h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8684870/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pre-match   </a></li><li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8686788/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match</a>   </li><li>  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8686819/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Post Match</a></li></ul><h3>MOTM</h3> <ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8686812/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Voting Thread</a><br>   </li><li>Result Thread</li><li>Winner - <br></li><li><a href="/page/KDS+MOTM+Winners+2011%2F12" target="_self">2011-12 Winners</a></li></ul>     <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Stats</h3>  <b>Celtic v Heart of Midlothian</b><br><br><b>Possession</b><br>41% 59% 92mins <br><br><b>Shots</b><br>12 3<br><br><b>On target</b><br>8 2<br><br><b>Corners</b><br>4 2<br><br><b>Fouls</b><br>15 15  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><br><br><embed height="350" src="http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/kds/widget/youtubevideo/17e0e0f3a47541b7b0ee97a5fabef2484368be78" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent"><h3>  Hooper nets five as Hoops finish season in style</h3>Gary Cooper scores his hat-trick goal today. He went on to score two more.<br>13/05/2012 - 14:34:22<br>Celtic 5 Hearts 0<br>Breakingnews.ie<br><br>Gary Hooper helped himself to five goals as he and Clydesdale Bank Premier League champions Celtic ended their season in style with a thrashing of Hearts at Parkhead.<br><br>The former Scunthorpe striker grabbed a first-half hat-trick, one coming from the spot, as Neil Lennon&rsquo;s men demolished the much-changed visitors.<br><br>Hooper struck twice more after the break, his fifth from a Georgios Samaras cross with three minutes remaining, taking his tally for to the season to 29 and joining Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd in players who have scored five goals in an SPL game.<br><br>The romp confirmed Celtic&rsquo;s supremacy this season with Neil Lennon&rsquo;s men finishing on 93 points, one more than last season when they finished second to Old Firm rivals Rangers.<br><br>Lennon made two changes as Victor Wanyama came in for right-back Mikael Lustig and striker Samaras took over from Anthony Stokes.<br><br>There was no surprise that Hearts made seven changes ahead of next week&rsquo;s William Hill Scottish Cup final against Edinburgh rivals Hibernian, starting with a front three of Arvydas Novikovas, Gary Glen and David Templeton.<br><br>Lennon, though, had expected the Gorgie club to have one eye on Hampden and it certainly looked that way in the first-half as Hooper punished their lethargy.<br><br>Jambos keeper Jamie MacDonald had to make an early save from Hooper after the Celtic striker had been set up by Kris Commons but the two men were involved in the fifth minute when the home side opened the scoring.<br><br>After Templeton failed to control a cross from Hoops left-back Emilio Izaguirre, Commons&rsquo; drive was spilled by MacDonald and Hooper was first to react to knock the ball in to the net from close range.<br><br>Moments later, the Scotland midfielder drilled in a low free-kick which MacDonald saved comfortably but he had no chance in the eighth minute when Samaras slalomed through his defence and past skipper Marius Zaliukas to set up Hooper for an easy tap-in.<br><br>MacDonald then had to move swiftly down to his right-hand post to parry a Charlie Mulgrew free-kick from 25 yards at the expense of a corner which the wobbling visitors survived.<br><br>Hearts boss Paulo Sergio replaced Mehdi Taouil with Denis Prychynenko with only 25 minutes gone in order to stabilise to his midfield.<br><br>But it was all too easy for Celtic and in the 39th minute Hooper completed his hat-trick when he slammed the ball past MacDonald from the spot after Novikovas had tripped Parkhead midfielder Joe Ledley in the box.<br><br>Novikovas was replaced by Jason Holt for the start of the second-half but Celtic quickly reasserted themselves and within a couple of minutes wing-back Adam Matthews cut in from the right to send a low drive past MacDonald but into the side netting.<br><br>When Commons, back to his best form in recent weeks and influential again, flighted an inviting free-kick across the Jambos six-yard box in the 53rd minute it only needed a touch to make it four but there were no takers.<br><br>On the hour mark, as the Celtic fans rejoiced in the troubles of administration-hit Old Firm rivals Rangers, a mistake by Loovens allowed Templeton in at the edge of the Celtic boss but his curled shot, the visitors first real attempt at goal, slipped past the far post.<br><br>In the 66th minute Hooper grabbed number four when Zaliukas stretched but failed to cut out a Commons pass, allowing the rampant Parkhead striker to calmly round MacDonald before knocking the ball into the net.<br><br>Immediately after the goal Beram Kayal got a huge ovation when he came on for Celtic skipper Scott Brown, the Israel midfielder making his first appearance since December after recovering from an ankle injury. Paddy McCourt then replaced Ledley.<br><br>It was not the performance Hearts were looking for ahead of next week&rsquo;s cup final and there was more pain to come.<br><br>Stokes replaced Commons with nine minutes remaining but by then the tempo had, unsurprisingly, gone out of the game.<br><br>However, in the 87th minute Hooper went nap when he converted a Samaras cross from a couple of yards out with the Jambos defence posted missing again and the title-winning celebrations began in earnest.  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>By Colin Moffat BBC Scotland<br><br>Gary Hooper ensured Celtic&#39;s championship party went with a bang as he netted five goals against Hearts.<br><br>Hooper tucked away two close-range finishes in the opening eight minutes and added a penalty when Joe Ledley was clipped by Arvydas Novikovas.<br><br>Celtic continued to dominate after the interval and Hooper rounded keeper Jamie MacDonald to score on 66 minutes.<br><br>With three minutes remaining, Hooper was in the right place again to complete the scoring.<br><br>It was the perfect way to prepare for the Scottish Premier League trophy presentation, with Celtic having wrapped up the title five weeks ago.<br><br>With one eye on next weekend&#39;s Scottish Cup final, Hearts made seven changes to their starting XI.<br><br>But manager Paulo Sergio selected his first-choice defence and will be worried at how easily they were torn apart by a rampant Celtic in the early stages.<br><br>A Kris Commons drive was spilled by Jamie MacDonald and Hooper was first to react to knock the ball into the net.<br><br>Soon after, Georgios Samaras weaved his way forward and sped past Hearts skipper Marius Zaliukas to set up Hooper for a second easy tap-in.<br><br>With Hearts wobbling, MacDonald had to look lively to parry a Charlie Mulgrew free-kick from 25 yards.<br><br>The early tempo dipped but Celtic retained in complete control, knocking the ball around with confidence.<br><br>And Hooper completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after 39 minutes when he drilled the ball down the middle from the spot after Novikovas had caught the heels of Ledley.<br><br>Early in the second half, Commons delivered a fantastic free-kick to the back post area, only to see Samaras inexplicably duck under the ball when it looked like a certain headed goal.<br><br>On the hour, a mistake by Glenn Loovens allowed David Templeton in for Hearts&#39;s only attempt on goal but the winger&#39;s curled shot slipped a couple of feet wide.<br><br>The fourth goal came following more good work from the impressive Commons.<br><br>A stretching Zaliukas could not cut out a raking pass from the Scotland midfielder, allowing Hooper to pick up the scraps, run around an exposed MacDonald.<br><br>Immediately after the goal Beram Kayal got a warm ovation when he came on for Celtic skipper Scott Brown, the Israel midfielder making his first appearance since December after recovering from an ankle injury.<br><br>Hooper looked determined not to allow anyone else a taste of glory when he got in the way of a Mulgrew shot.<br><br>And the English striker completed a memorable day when he knocked in his 29th goal of the season, converting a clever cross from Samaras  <br><br><br><h3>BBC</h3><h3>  Celtic manager Neil Lennon hails five-star Gary Hooper</h3><br>Manager Neil Lennon heaped praise on five-goal Gary Hooper after Celtic finally got their hands on the Scottish Premier League trophy.<br><br>Having secured the title early last month Celtic ended their campaign in style with a 5-0 rout of Hearts.<br><br>Hooper netted all of the goals, prompting Lennon to say: &quot;It was a tremendous individual performance.<br><br>&quot;He is a goalscorer, they are priceless but we want to keep him here and we will do our very best to do that.&quot;<br>Continue reading the main story<br><br> &ldquo;We&#39;re really excited at the prospect of being in the Champions League again.

If you look at Nikica Jelavic [former Rangers striker] and what he has achieved since going to Everton there is no reason why Gary Hooper can&#39;t do that, in any division, whether that be in the Premier League, or in Spain or Italy.<br><br>&quot;He scores big goals in big games, he has a good record against Rangers and he has scored in Europe.<br><br>&quot;He is only 24 and has got the world at his feet so we would like to keep him.&quot;<br><br>Hooper, who last scored five before he turned professional, admitted that it had been a perfect day for him and gave no indication that he was considering a move away from Glasgow.<br><br>&quot;Scoring five goals and picking the SPL trophy up - you can&#39;t ask for much more,&quot; he enthused.<br><br>&quot;I thought we were outstanding from start to finish.

Crowned SPL champions over a month ago, Celtic finally got their hands on the trophy today after hammering Hearts 5-0 in front of a packed Paradise.<br><br>All five goals came from the outstanding Gary Hooper who ended the campaign on 29 goals, and Celtic Park was rocking as the title celebrations got underway.<br><br>Neil Lennon couldn&rsquo;t have wished for events to unfold in a better way, and after lifting the trophy to huge cheers on the pitch, he felt able to savour the success of the past 12 months. He was a proud man.<br><br>&quot;We can reflect on what we have achieved now,&quot; he said. &quot;It&acute;s a fantastic feeling. I&acute;m delighted for the players and supporters and I was delighted with the performance today. It was a fitting way to end the season. The supporters were in good voice. It was a great day for the club.<br><br>&quot;I wanted them to finish the season on a high and wanted them to play entertaining football and win the game handsomely and I got all that today.<br><br>&quot;We have been pretty much flawless since October in the league. We had a couple of defeats along the way but the quality and intensity in the play for a good four or five months was excellent. We have broken the clean sheet record.<br><br>&quot;I think we just fell short today of one goal of what we scored last year. We have the best disciplinary record in the country and we have won the league by 20 points so that ticks all the boxes for me.&quot;<br><br>Hooper struck a hat-trick in the first half with some typical predatory finishes before bagging a brace after the break. It was a wonderful display by the Englishman.<br><br>&quot;It was a tremendous individual performance and a great achievement,&quot; said the manager. &quot;I think that took him to 24 league goals. He&acute;s a special player and I&acute;m delighted that he&acute;s fulfilling all the talent we think he has.<br><br>&quot;He&acute;s happy here. Obviously there will be people out there who would pay for his talent and his goals. He&acute;s a goalscorer. They are priceless in the game. But we want to keep him here and will do our very best to do that.&quot;<br><br>After being presented with the trophy, the Hoops boss went over the corner of the stadium occupied by the Green Brigade and left it sitting there on the pitch, dedicating the title triumph to supporters.<br><br>&quot;I just wanted to say thank you to them because week-in, week-out, they have created a great atmosphere,&quot; he explained. &quot;They sing non-stop, they add colour. Sometimes they are a little bit controversial but in the main they have behaved themselves impeccably.<br><br>&quot;They have changed the culture of the stadium. It&acute;s a fun place to come for supporters and the atmosphere over the last two years in some of the big games has been fantastic and they have been the catalyst for that.<br><br>&quot;The noise, the singing, the pride &ndash; it&#39;s all there now. I&acute;m delighted with that. It was missing for a few years and I think more than anything, the fans have their pride back.&quot;<br><br>Beram Kayal made his return to action following five months on the sidelines with an ankle injury as a second-half substitute. The manager was keen for him to receive recognition for his contribution over the campaign. It had been a colossal collective effort.<br><br>&quot;I wanted to give the players who have made big contributions the opportunity to play today, and Beram has been a huge player for us and, bar injury, he would have played a lot more for us this season,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I was delighted with the performance, the professionalism and the quality of the players out there today and it augers well for the future.<br><br>&quot;We want to come back and defend the title as best we can next year but we want to play at the big table,&quot; he added. &quot;One of our first competitive game will probably be one of the Champions League qualifiers so we have a lot of hard work in front of us to get ready for that.&quot;<br><br><br>Five-star Hooper gets the party going at Paradise<br><br>By: Laura Brannan on 13 May, 2012 14:19<br><br>May 13, 2012<br>Scottish Premier League<br>Celtic Park<br><br>CELTIC 5<br>(Hooper 5, 8, 38, 66, 88)<br><br>HEARTS 0<br><br><br>IT was the Gary Hooper show at Celtic Park as the Champions closed the 2011/12 season with an emphatic 5-0 win against Hearts. The English striker hit all five goals, including a first-half penalty, to seal the three points.<br><br>Celtic enjoyed complete dominance over the Edinburgh side and as they brought their remarkable campaign to an end, they were presented with the much-deserved SPL trophy, which was draped in green and white ribbons once again.<br><br>Scott Brown lifted the silverware in front of a packed Celtic Park as the Hoops finished the season on 93 points, which beat last year&acute;s tally.<br><br>And it didn&rsquo;t take long for the party to get started - just five minutes in fact. Kris Commons, who was looking sharp, took the initial shot, but goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald blocked it. He couldn&rsquo;t control it, though, and Hooper was on hand to tap it home from close-range, sparking the first of many celebrations.<br><br>Just three minutes had passed before the striker gave the supporters even more reasons to sing. This time it was Georgios Samaras who did the hard work, beating Marius Zaliukas to slide the ball in for Hooper, who duly tapped it into the open net.<br><br>With Celtic two goals ahead with less than 10 minutes on the clock, Celtic Park was already in jubilant spirits and the team were looking comfortable. The visitors barely mounted an attack and were chasing shadows every time Celtic were in possession.<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew came close to adding to the tally when he curled a free-kick over the wall, and Samaras attempted to slide home at the far post, but couldn&acute;t make contact with the ball in time.<br><br>Seven minutes before half-time though, Joe Ledley was fouled inside the box and referee Alan Muir awarded Celtic with a penalty. Looking for his hat-trick, Hooper stepped up, and slotted it straight down the middle for his third of the afternoon.<br><br>Celtic started the second half the same way they finished the first, looking just as comfortable in possession. Commons swung in a free-kick on 54 minutes but Samaras couldn&rsquo;t head home at the far post for the Hoops&acute; fourth.<br><br>It took an hour for Hearts to have their first attempt on goal, but as David Templeton tried to curl the ball around Fraser Forster, who had a very quiet afternoon, it went well wide of the target.<br><br>It proved to be a rare attack outside of Hearts&acute; half, and Celtic added to their tally on 66 minutes. Again, it was Hooper who did the damage, breaking away from the Hearts backline and rounding MacDonald, slotting home his, and Celtic&acute;s fourth of the afternoon.<br><br>There was a standing ovation for Beram Kayal who replaced Brown a minute later. It was Kayal&acute;s first appearance since being injured against Rangers in December and the supporters showed their delight at his return to fitness.<br><br>Celtic continued to look hungry in front of goal, particularly Samaras, though he was the provider for Celtic&acute;s last goal, two minutes from full-time. He slid the ball in for Hooper, and the striker rounded off his tally for the afternoon, tapping in for his, and Celtic&acute;s fifth strike against the Edinburgh side.<br><br>The full-time whistle was met by rapturous applause from the packed Celtic Park support and the title party celebrations got underway.<br><br><br>CELTIC (4-4-2): Forster; Wanyama, Loovens, Mulgrew; Matthews, Brown (Kayal 67), Ledley (McCourt 69), Commons (Stokes 81), Izaguirre; Samaras, Hooper.<br>Subs not used: Zaluska, Cha, Lustig, F. Twardzik<br><br>HEARTS (4-4-2): MacDonald, McGowan, Webster (Barr 83), Zaliukas, Grainger; Robinson, Mrowiec, Taouil (Prychynenko 25), Templeton; Novikovas (Holt 46), Glen<br>Subs not used: Ridgers, Driver, Skacel, Santana  <br><br></embed></div>
