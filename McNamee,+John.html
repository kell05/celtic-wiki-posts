John later played in the 1963 Scottish Cup final defeat by Rangers but it was a good start.<br><br>However, things went wrong when he was sent home early from a tour of Ireland following that he had broken a curfew the night before a match (albeit a friendly). In one reserve match he was booked for the surprising fact that he was arguing with his own team&#39;s goalkeeper, the irrepressible Frank Haffey.<br><br>He wasn&#39;t to make it at Celtic, but in fairness this was a dire time to be at Celtic with many good players underperforming, badly coached and very seriously on the verge of leaving.<br><br>He was then signed by Jock Stein to play for Hibernian in April 1964, where he would form a strong defensive partnership with <a href="/page/Stanton%2C+Pat" target="_self">Pat Stanton</a>. But then Stein himself moved in the opposite direction early in the next year and didn&#39;t take him back.<br><br>In later years, John McNamee was quoted as saying:<br><blockquote>&quot;<i>Jock Stein left for Celtic shortly after signing me and you can&#39;t help but wonder what Hibs might have achieved had he not gone to Parkhead. We all believe we&#39;d have won the league that season but you could understand why he went to Celtic, they&#39;d brought him back from Wales as a player and it was always his ambition to manage them.</i>&quot;<br></blockquote><br>It was a cruel twist of fate for John McNamee, and he&#39;ll never know what might have happened if he&#39;d stayed at Celtic and Stein had gone to Celtic having not taken him to Hibs, or maybe if Stein had simply not left Hibs having taken John McNamee over. Prior to Stein&#39;s arrival at Celtic as manager, Celtic had been underachieving for a long time, and under Jimmy McGrory, the coaching staff were practically impotent as the board meddled with the first side. Morale was low. <br><br>Celtic had become no place for an aspiring young player, and John McNamee&#39;s story was sadly not a unique one at the club. So leaving for Hibs was not actually a bad decision, but it was just poor luck that Stein moved the other way not long after. Possibly at this point in his career, he may have felt himself to be jinxed.<br><br>Luck and good fortune finally came John&#39;s way when he signed for Newcastle United in December 1966, going on to be part of their team that won the Inter-cities Fairs Cup in 1969. In the semi-final, Newcastle faced Rangers and John McNamee warmed up at  Ibrox wearing his Celtic shirt. He explained: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;I was just winding them  up, but football had a sense of humour and no one accused me of inciting  the crowd.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>So despite losing out on playing for Celtic in a glorious period, he managed to gain glory with Newcastle Utd. John McNamee is still a very fondly remembered player in Newcastle&#39;s history, and is probably the first Celtic-linked player to have won a medal in that European club competition (the Inter-Cities Fair Cup is seen as a predecessor to the UEFA Cup).<br><br>After leaving Newcastle in 1971, he played for Blackburn Rovers (where he was said to have brought &#39;<i>self-respect and steel to the team</i>&#39;), Hartlepool United, Lancaster City and Workington before retiring in 1976.<br><br>He became a postman in the Lake District, but his bruising battles on  the park took their toll and severe arthritis forced him into  retirement.<br><br>John McNamee now lives in Cumbria. In 2017, he was diagnosed with Alzhiemers.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3><div align="center">  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">1959-64</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">27</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">7</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">38</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals:</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">3</td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><br><div align="center"><div align="center">  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>    <tr><td align="center" width="30%"><b>Club<br></b></td><td align="center" width="21%"><b>From<br></b></td><td align="center" width="23%"><b>To<br></b></td><td align="center" width="23%"><b>Appearances<br></b></td><td align="center" width="2%"><b>Goals<br></b></td></tr><tr>  <td width="30%">Celtic</td>  <td align="center" width="21%">1960</td>  <td align="center" width="23%">1964</td>  <td align="center" width="23%">27</td>  <td align="center" width="2%">2</td>  </tr><tr><td width="30%">Hibernian</td><td align="center" width="21%">1964</td><td align="center" width="23%">1967</td><td align="center" width="23%">77</td><td align="center" width="2%">4</td></tr><tr><td width="30%">Newcastle Utd.</td><td align="center" width="21%">1967</td><td align="center" width="23%">1972</td><td align="center" width="23%">117</td><td align="center" width="2%">8</td></tr><tr><td width="30%">Blackburn Rov.</td><td align="center" width="21%">1972</td><td align="center" width="23%">1973</td><td align="center" width="23%">56</td><td align="center" width="2%">9</td></tr><tr><td width="30%">Hartlepool Utd</td><td align="center" width="21%">1973</td><td align="center" width="23%">1974</td><td align="center" width="23%">2</td><td align="center" width="2%">0</td></tr><tr><td width="30%">Lancaster City</td><td align="center" width="21%">1974</td><td align="center" width="23%">197</td><td align="center" width="23%">?</td><td align="center" width="2%">?</td></tr><tr><td width="30%">Workington</td><td align="center" width="21%">1975</td><td align="center" width="23%">1976</td><td align="center" width="23%">2</td><td align="center" width="2%">0</td></tr><tr><td width="30%"><b>Totals<br></b></td><td align="center" width="21%"><b>1975<br></b></td><td align="center" width="23%"><b>1976<br></b></td><td align="center" width="23%"><b>281<br></b></td><td align="center" width="2%"><b>23<br></b></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3>none<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/McNamee%2C+John+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>Where are they now?

Football has become softer, not tougher.&quot;<br><br>To illustrate the point MacNamee recalls a fierce battle with Stoke City&#39;s tough centre-forward John Ritchie.<br><br>Mac added: &quot;John and I always had a pitched battle and this day he caught me with an elbow and cut my mouth open.<br><br>&quot;I had eight stitches in the wound but came back on for another crack at him.<br><br>&quot;It was so niggly, the referee kept blowing up to separate us until John called him to one side and said &#39;Will you leave us alone, we&#39;re trying to enjoy ourselves.&quot;&#39; MacNamee signed for Celtic in 1958, as a 17-year-old who had been spotted playing in Glasgow by Jock Stein.<br><br>He became a first-team regular and was on the losing side in the 1963 Scottish Cup Final when Rangers beat Celtic 3-0.<br><br>Stein moved to Hibs the following year and took MacNamee with him for Pounds 17,500 - the only player the ex-Scotland boss ever signed twice. Soon after England won the World Cup, Joe Harvey paid Pounds 27,500 to take him to St James&#39; and in 1969 MacNamee and the Magpies enjoyed their finest hour when Newcastle won the old Fairs Cup - today&#39;s UEFA Cup.<br><br>In the semi-final, Newcastle faced Rangers and MacNamee warmed up at Ibrox wearing his Celtic shirt. He explained: &quot;I was just winding them up, but football had a sense of humour and no one accused me of inciting the crowd.&quot;<br><br>He said: &quot;I loved turning out in the black and white stripe. The Newcastle fans were out of this world and they really took to me because they knew I gave 100 per cent.&quot;<br><br>MacNamee ended his playing career with Blackburn Rovers, enjoying similar adoration at Ewood Park before calling it a day in 1974.<br><br>After a brief managerial career, an ill-fated six months at Division Four Workington and a spell coaching at Carlisle United, John quit soccer.<br><br>He became a postman in the Lake District, but his bruising battles on the park took their toll and severe arthritis forced him into retirement.<br><br>Now 57, widower MacNamee is a doting grandad, looking after seven-month-old Catlin Rose when his son John - one of four children - is at work.<br><br>He joked: &quot;I love pushing her pram - it stops me needing a zimmer frame.                       <div><div class="headline"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Emotional ER return for old boy McNamee</h3>Published Date:                                  15 November 2008 </div></div><div>                               <div class="byline">By DAVID HARDIE</div>                                                                                                                                                                                   <div class="ds-firstpara">FORMER Hibs star John McNamee has paid his first visit to Easter Road since leaving for Newcastle United more than 40 years ago.</div>                       <div class="va-bodytext">The  uncompromising centre-half, now 67 and living in Cumbria, was greeted by  former team-mates Peter Cormack and John Fraser as he arrived for the  SPL clash with Inverness Caledonian Thistle.<br><br>And he was immediately struck by the remarkable transformation  of the ground, most noticeably the disappearance of the double-tiered  terracing which once faced the tunnel and Easter Road&#39;s famous slope.<br><br>McNamee,  signed by Jock Stein from Celtic, went on to play for Newcastle United  where he won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, the forerunner of the UEFA Cup,  and settled in the Lake District after his playing career came to an  end. Today he said: &quot;I&#39;ve never really had the chance to come back. My  wife died in 1983 so I always had to be there for our children.<br><br>&quot;But  I&#39;ve a good friend, Gordon Clark, who lives in Stirling, a lifelong  Hibs fan, who has always been asking me to come up. When I signed for  Hibs I used to get Gordon tickets for matches and even gave him a lift  through from the west. I thoroughly enjoyed my day, meeting up with  Peter and John again and reminiscing about the good old days. I also had  the chance to have a chat with Eddie Turnbull and Lawrie Reilly.<br><br>&quot;Jock  Stein left for Celtic shortly after signing me and you can&#39;t help but  wonder what Hibs might have achieved had he not gone to Parkhead. We all  believe we&#39;d have won the  league that season but you could understand  why he went to Celtic, they&#39;d brought him back from Wales as a player  and it was always his ambition to manage them.<br><br>&quot;I couldn&#39;t get  over how the ground has changed, it&#39;s a tremendous stadium now and will  be even better when the new East Stand is built. It was also a surprise  to see the slope gone, it was a great psychological thing for us and, to  be honest, it looked as if today&#39;s team could have done with shooting  down it last weekend.<br><br>&quot;That was the big disappointment of the  day, that the team didn&#39;t play well and were beaten.&quot; McNamee returned  home promising to make an early return to Easter Road, although his next  big reunion will be Newcastle marking the 40th anniversary of winning  the Fairs Cup when they beat Ujpest Dozsa.<br><br>He said: &quot;I had five  terrific years with Newcastle, there were quite a few Scots in the side  including Jim Scott, who had also come from Hibs, and Gordon Marshall.&quot;</div><br>                                                                        <ul class="viewarticle_info"><li>                           Last Updated:                             15 November 2008 11:13 AM                         </li><li>                                                        Source:                              Edinburgh Evening News                                                    </li></ul>                     </div><h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>Recalling Newcastle United&#39;s former &#39;hard man&#39; centre-half John McNamee</h3><br>As John McNamee, 74, is forced from his Cumbrian home by flooding, we recall his career at Newcastle United<br><br>https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/recalling-newcastle-uniteds-former-hard-10580868<br>ByDavid Morton<br><br> 15:30, 10 DEC 2015Updated15:50, 10 DEC 2015<br><br><br>The Chronicle was saddened this week to report on the situation of former Newcastle United centre-half John McNamee.<br><br>For the second time John, now 74, has been a victim of the dramatic flooding which has badly affected Cumbria and forced many people from their homes.<br><br>For most United fans in 2015, McNamee&rsquo;s time at St James&rsquo; Park will have come before their own, but his name resounds loudly down the decades from that golden era of Fairs Cup success.<br><br>Signed by manager Joe Harvey in December 1966 to help plug relegation-threatened United&rsquo;s defence, the burley stopper sits alongside the likes of David Batty and Brian Kilcline as one of the genuine &ldquo;hard men&rdquo; to pull on the black and white shirt.<br><br>Not the most skilfully gifted of footballers, McNamee&rsquo;s hard-as-nail qualities earned him a trial with Manchester United as a youngster, before he began his senior career with Celtic in 1959, then moved to Hibernian in 1964.<br><br>The Scot&rsquo;s Toon debut came at White Hart Lane on New Year&rsquo;s Eve with Jimmy Greaves running riot, and Spurs running out 4-0 winners.<br><br>Better was to follow in the second half of the season and a string of wins in March and April helped United finish a dizzying 20th in the First Division, avoiding relegation by four points.<br><br>The following season - 1967-68 - saw McNamee&rsquo;s muscle help United to 10th in the league, and famously secure qualification for Europe.<br><br>Along the way, John endeared himself to the 1960s Toon Army, by netting a late equaliser in a 3-3 against Sunderland at Roker Park and swinging in celebration on the crossbar in front of the enraged Fulwell End.<br><br>As the Magpies, to the amazement of many, took Europe by storm, John McNamee was part of the squad which finally lifted silver in Budapest.<br><br>His greatest moment during the campaign surely came in the semi-final first leg at Ibrox in front of 75,000 baying fans where he kept out his old Glasgow adversaries, Rangers, on the way to a priceless 0-0 draw.<br><br>McNamee&rsquo;s final game for United came in May 1971 at Coventry City&rsquo;s Highfield Road.<br><br>After Newcastle, the stopper turned out for Blackburn Rovers, Morton and Hartlepool, before he briefly managed Workington and coached at Carlisle.<br><br>In later years, settling in Cockermouth in the Lake District, John worked a postman before a serious accident forced him to retire in 1988.<br><br><div>The Chronicle extends its very best wishes to a former St James&rsquo; Park favourite. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3></div><div></div><br></div></div>
