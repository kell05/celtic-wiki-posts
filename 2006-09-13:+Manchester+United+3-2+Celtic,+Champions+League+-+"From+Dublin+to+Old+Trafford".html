At least this year it&#39;s back...<br> <br> There is something you forget when you book those extremely cheap<br> flights and that is that (a) they usually take off at a crazy hour<br> and (b) they may not be going exactly where you want to end up.<br> <br> My alarm went off at about 3.45am on Wednesday September 13th - it<br> was the sign that another european trip was about to kick off. I<br> drove off to pick up three other lhads and we headed for the<br> airport. Having checked in online (new security procedures?) we were<br> well on schedule.<br> <br> Met up with one more lhad and five of us were set for the trip -<br> four Man U end tickets and one Celtic end ticket between us. Getting<br> tickets was a saga in itself but something we were pretty used to. I<br> don&#39;t know if there is a fair answer to the whole thing but the way<br> it is organised and distributed by Celtic has to be questioned.<br> Anyway - that&#39;s for another day. Europe: we were on our way.<br> <br> When we booked our flights - having first contemplated, booked and<br> then cancelled a boat trip - the catch to the 99 cent flights was that<br> the flights were actually heading to East Midlands airport where we <br> would then have to hire a car for the road trip to Manchester. Yeah, <br> I know, but it seemed like a really smart move a few weeks ago.<br> <br> We had a very smooth flight and touched down at East  Midlands<br> airport at about 7.30 in the morning and immediately headed for the<br> car rental desk. One of the lhads managed to find out that the<br> friendly car rental fellow was a Hearts fan. Would you believe it.<br> We had a good laugh as we looked at him standing there admitting<br> this with a big &#39;Hertz&#39; sign in the background over his head.. you<br> had to be there!<br> <br> We picked up the car and headed off down the road. Not very far,<br> mind you as we&#39;d booked into the Travel Lodge hotel beside the<br> airport. It was too early an hour to get into our room so we grabbed<br> some breakfast before they had a room ready for us. We threw<br> the bags into the room and headed for Manchester which was about an<br> hour and forty minutes away. Traffic was fine and we found our way <br> to Old Trafford handily enough (after a brief tour of the local industrial <br> estates!).<br> <br> Old Trafford already looked like there was a big game on. It was<br> only about midday and there were stewards, touts and fans out and<br> about around the place. We had to get to the ticket office to<br> collect one of the tickets and we were directed up towards it and<br> allowed to park outside the door, having been reminded we couldn&#39;t<br> stay there all day (compare and contrast to the Celtic Ticket<br> Office). Their ticket office was modern and spacious and, more<br> importantly, it had a very short queue. It only took a few minutes<br> to pick up the ticket and there was absolutely no problem, despite<br> our Celtic colours. Not a question asked.<br> <br> As we walked from the ticket office we went for a look around the<br> stadium. Nobody was stopping us and there was a very relaxed mood<br> all round. We found their club store and decided to give it a visit.<br> Again it was fairly spacious but we didn&#39;t buy anything. A girl who<br> was selling credit cards seemed baffled by our accents. In her own<br> best &#39;Coronation Street&#39; accent she asked : &quot;you&#39;re from `southern&#39;<br> Ireland, right ? - and Celtic are from Scotland, right ?...so how<br> come you follow Celtic then?&quot; As we saw snapshots from endless<br> messageboard postings and mailing lists reappear before our eyes we<br> all laughed and wondered how much time she had. We gave a very brief<br> answer but it was amazing to meet somebody who really knew nothing<br> about our club as she stood there in the middle of one of the<br> largest football club shops in Europe. We were still wondering about<br> all of this when one of the lhads had asked her if she knew where we<br> could park our car for the game. Unbelievably she produced a car<br> park ticket and handed it over to him free of charge. It was for the<br> Old Trafford car park, a couple of hundred yards from the stadium<br> gates! Don&#39;t you just love those credit card girls! And, no , we<br> didn&#39;t buy a credit card - sure weren&#39;t we from &#39;southern&#39; Ireland!<br> <br> We parked the car - literally just a little further down the road<br> from the ticket office - and felt fairly smug and full of self<br> importance as we got out. Then we noticed a car with an Irish<br> registration plate parking beside us from which a couple of lads got<br> out decked in those horrible new Manchester United shirts. We looked<br> at them. Actually we stared at them. &quot;We&#39;re in the Irish end&quot; we<br> told them. We got a muffled reply that hinted that the Irish end was<br> the Stretford end. Bullshampoo. &quot;Wrong, a chara, - we&#39;ll be under the<br> tricolours and singing our own National Anthem while you&#39;ll be under<br> the Butcher&#39;s Apron paying homage to one of England&#39;s teams&quot;, we<br> pointed out. There was no further discussion.<br> <br> As the car was parked we were free to head off and grab some food or<br> drink. We had to meet some lhads who were on the coaches coming from<br> Glasgow and we rang to find out that they&#39;d be arriving at about<br> 1.30 or 2.00pm. There was a hotel across the road from Old Trafford<br> (noted for our next visit!) and we headed over to the bar until we<br> got word that the coaches had arrived. Once we got the word, we<br> linked up and finalised the ticket situation. The Celtic end ticket<br> had been collected for us by a Tim who we didn&#39;t know that well but<br> who had gone well out of his way to make an emergency collection for<br> us the day before, due to a bit of a cock up at the Ticket Office.<br> Fair play to him and he was extremely decent to help us out. We met<br> up with him and some others and when we were all sorted we headed<br> off to indulge in some local grub and beverages. Having been<br> rejected by the nearest spot &quot;sorry mate - locals only &quot;, we<br> eventually found `Frankie &amp; Benny&#39;s Restaurant Bar&#39; on Trafford Road<br> which was about ten minutes from the ground and we settled in there.<br> There was a good gang of us at that stage so we set up tent for the<br> afternoon with the thought of moving on to the Irish Centre for a<br> concert later on. Needless to say that never happened as we were<br> able to move outside and sit in the sun after eating! That was that -<br> with apologies to those we didn&#39;t meet up with at the Irish centre.<br> <br> Eventually after a good bit of food, chat, sing song and bevy we<br> headed for the game. I like getting in to the ground early myself to<br> soak up the atmosphere and so I headed in about an hour before kick<br> off.<br> <br> I was amazed to see how many Tims were in before me and already<br> singing away heartily. Those coaches must have been good craic! Old<br> Trafford looks pretty impressive but it helps when you&#39;re in the<br> Celtic end (guess who had that ticket, then?). The players got a big<br> welcome when they first came out for the warm up and the singing was<br> getting louder by the minute. In contrast the Manchester Utd fans<br> seemed to be fairly subdued.<br> I looked around me as the stadium filled and filled. I could see<br> Celtic colours everywhere amongst the Man Utd sections so this was<br> clearly going to be a bit like Anfield in the UEFA Cup. I was just<br> hoping it might be a similar result. I&#39;ll never forget that night.<br> <br> I stood there, stomach churning, in the Celtic end at Old Trafford<br> in the Champions League and then that easily recognisable and<br> lovable theme music started. The music that really sent the spine<br> tingling. Yes, the Champions League music started up and the kids<br> shook the large circular flag over the centre circle as the teams<br> marched out. The Celtic fans roared and as I was looking around me I<br> was thinking &quot;this is what it&#39;s all about, this is where we should<br> be. This is where we must stay&quot;.<br> <br> After the teams lined up and headed for the kick off, I took a wee<br> glance at the referee. I wondered if the guy knew how much he had<br> contributed to all those weeks of footballing depression in my life<br> and, no doubt, in many other lives? A man who saw diving as a<br> footballing art form. How the feck was this man supposed to be one<br> of the best referees in the world? Was I the only one who thought he<br> was pretty poor every time I saw him? Little did I know what was<br> ahead of me.. little did I know..<br> <br> The game started off fairly well. The Celtic fans were certainly<br> winning on the terraces or should I say seats and the team was<br> playing fairly safely. They seemed a little nervous at first and<br> under a bit of pressure and but for a couple of efforts from Saha -<br> Boruc wasn&#39;t really being troubled. Then at one uneventful moment<br> Boruc got the ball, trotted around and gave the ball an almighty<br> hoof into the air. Feck me, I don&#39;t think I ever saw Wimbledon hit<br> it that far. Then JVoH seemed to attack and control the ball all in<br> one movement which made Rio `Big Wages&#39; Ferdinand fall on his arse.<br> Now if I was to be hopeful about anybody approaching a shot at goal<br> these days, it would be JVoH. However I presumed that Van de Sar -<br> who I rate as a super goalkeeper - would palm it away or even hold<br> it. Having said that, the one thing that I&#39;ve noticed lately is that<br> when JVoH hits a ball - he bleedin&#39; well hits the ball!. and<br> next thing I know is that the net is bulging at the far end of the<br> ground. Brief silence. Eyes link up to brain: we&#39;ve scored. Pande-<br> feckin-monium. Up on the seats, down the steps, hugging, dancing and<br> thumping people I don&#39;t even know- but we are all part of the same<br> footballing family. What a feeling. what a feeling. We are winning<br> at Old Trafford in the Champions League. This is what it&#39;s all<br> about. This is what it&#39;s all about.<br> <br> The game moved on. A second was like a minute. A minute was like an<br> hour. We seemed to be doing okay but there was a feeling that the<br> goals weren&#39;t over. Another longish ball was thumped up to Giggs -<br> it was going nowhere really. I saw Boruc run across his area, right<br> there, down below, in front of me. I presumed Boruc was just going<br> to do one of those dummies and let the ball run out. But suddenly<br> Giggs seemed to try to control it by stretching his leg, Boruc then<br> decided he had to avoid Giggs, Giggs went down and the feckin ref<br> decided to award a peno! What is going on here? It happened so fast<br> that I decided that, well, maybe I missed something? I&#39;ll ring home<br> later for the TV replay and the &#39;pundits&#39; (note the inverted commas)<br> opinions. I was shocked but was a little unsure as were many of<br> those around me. We thought we must have missed something - how else<br> would the referee award it? I wouldn&#39;t mind but Blessed Artur wasn&#39;t<br> far from saving that penalty either - he got a hand to it but after<br> all of that, they were level. The bassas!<br> <br> The game moved on and we&#39;re still doing alright. Giggs goes off and<br> has me thinking that maybe he was indeed fouled for the penalty - I<br> just wasn&#39;t sure at the time. The ball then comes out from the<br> Celtic defence. McGeady passes it through the centre, towards<br> Gravesen and Tommy G. seems to get caught in possession. The ball<br> appears to bobble around before being knocked through. Saha gets a<br> touch and it seems to roll - no, crawl - directly below me into the<br> net. But it was like slow motion. I expected somebody to slide<br> across the line and to clear it - you know the way you see it on<br> some highlights packages. But it never happened. I looked at the<br> ref - you owe us ya fecker. But nothing. No signals. No offsides. No<br> fouls. It&#39;s a goal. 1-2 down. Bollox.<br> <br> I started to doubt things then. Please God, not one of those 4-1 or<br> 5-1 games, where the losers were winning. I&#39;ve seen them on La Liga<br> games on the television. It&#39;s funny what you think of. We hang in<br> there and I&#39;m thinking if we keep it to one goal at half time we&#39;ll be<br> well in there. My fingers are crossed (luckily I&#39;m not in<br> Scotland!).<br> <br> As half-time approaches, the ball is passed around and ends up at<br> Jarosik&#39;s feet. He appears to get caught as he attempts to knock the<br> ball beyond Brown. The ref awards a free kick. That&#39;s alright -<br> we&#39;ll take it. Now in recent weeks I&#39;ve always thought that Nakamura<br> might be good for a free kick goal at Old Trafford - particularly<br> when he hasn&#39;t put one away lately. So as he steps up, along with<br> the rest in the Celtic end, I&#39;m murmuring - &#39;c&#39;mon Naka, put in the<br> corner&#39;. There&#39;s a sort of silence in the Celtic end as he sets it<br> up. Come on.. please.. please. I&#39;ll eat sushi every week for the<br> rest of my life. Jarosik trots up and stands in the wall. I&#39;m<br> thinking - &#39;get out of there, ya tall eejit - you&#39;ll block his shot,<br> knowing our luck&#39;. Nakamura then trots up and hits the ball - the<br> keeper doesn&#39;t move but the net is bulging. So I&#39;m thinking - he<br> took it before the whistle - feck that! But no, the net is bulging -<br> what? - the net is bulging. The ref is pointing for a goal. All<br> hell breaks out in the Celtic end - if it was a film it would be<br> called Pande-feckin-monium 2. Down those steps again, jumping,<br> hugging, cheering, screaming. Old Trafford, 2-2, nearly half-time.<br> Bhoy, it&#39;s great feeling. Reminds me of Anfield again - written off,<br> snooty English journalists, men against boys, blah, blah. Get it<br> right up you. Can you hear me Maggie Thatcher? Your boys are taking<br> one hell of a beating! (or something similar - like drawing).<br> <br> Half time whistle next. I&#39;ll be fecked if I&#39;m gonna leave my seat<br> for some manky toilet. I&#39;m gonna enjoy this! I stay there, ringing,<br> contacting anybody - a wrong number will do. I want to talk to the<br> world. We&#39;re doing alright here and this shower aren&#39;t looking too<br> over confident now.<br> <br> The second half starts. Tims are still finding their seats. The ball<br> is given away to Nakamura - feck me, they&#39;re at home and they&#39;re<br> still nervous - giving the ball away like that. Naka then passes to<br> Gravesen who attempts a difficult pass which is intercepted. They&#39;re<br> not the only ones giving the ball away. It&#39;s knocked forward - oh<br> bollix, its Saha again - it ends up with Solskjear. Aawww, nooooo -<br> the net bulges. Same end - wrong team. For fecks sake the half has<br> only started. Bollox.<br> <br> We quietened down briefly but the singing starts up very quickly<br> again. The game moves on. They have chances as we do but they seem<br> to have more opportunities. Boruc makes some good saves from Rooney<br> but his best save of the game is from a teammate ! Time is edging<br> away. I suddenly feel we might not do it. What about a peno? No -<br> how could I forget - its Lubos Michel. The final whistle goes. Don&#39;t<br> give me any of this brave valiant losers shampooe. As an Irishman I&#39;m<br> well used to it in various sports. Feck that stuff- we could have<br> taken this game tonight but for silly mistakes. As ever, we cheer<br> the team anyway. &quot; We are Celtic supporters, faithful through and<br> through...&quot;<br> <br> I head out towards the car. I ring home to be told about all the<br> plaudits from the pundits. Feck them - you&#39;d be happy if you thought<br> they knew anything about football.<br> <br> At the car we all meet up again - all down but not out.<br> <br> Manchester United might be a big club but I&#39;ll tell you one thing -<br> they don&#39;t know how to clear a stadium. Not a cop in sight outside<br> (unlike Celtic Park) and everybody is left to sit for over an hour<br> or so without moving. Ridiculous stuff and then you have to try to<br> force your car out anyway. An utter shambollix of a set up and one<br> you don&#39;t need at that hour of the night, particularly after a<br> result like that.<br> <br> We eventually get away and do about three tours of the Trafford area<br> before we find a road that seems to head towards the M6. To simplify<br> matters I&#39;ll put it this way : we got back to the hotel near East<br> Midlands airport after 2am! Lashing rain, flooding roads and of<br> course, Celtic had lost. Not quite the mood or weather we had had as<br> we headed towards Old Trafford earlier that day. Sometimes I wonder<br> if these games are all about the build up!<br> <br> We eventually reached our hotel and crawled into bed but only to get<br> up about four hours later for our flight home.<br> <br> It was nearly 7am as we headed out the door of the hotel. It&#39;s<br> raining as if it was a tropical storm. We lost - we all know God is<br> a Tim - but come on - I&#39;ve never seen rain like that before!<br> <br> We move down the road towards the airport. We&#39;ve already checked in<br> online so we find ourselves boarding fairly quickly. Nobody is in<br> any great form as the plane smashes through the dark rain clouds.<br> <br> We had departed Dublin at 06.35 on Wednesday 13th September 2006. We<br> were arriving back in Dublin at 09.15am on Thursday 14th<br> September.We&#39;d only been away just over 24 hours but it felt like it<br> had been much, much longer. What a trip.<br> <br> As we landed all I could think of was `roll on the next game&#39;. We<br> can definitely get through this group.<br> <br> We left the plane and headed towards the car with that Champions<br> League music still ringing in our years. Two home games ahead -<br> let&#39;s win them!<br> <br> This is where we should be.<br> <br> Dubcelt.</div></div>
