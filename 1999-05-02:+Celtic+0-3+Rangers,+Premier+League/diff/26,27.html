Dallas had a record of being less than partial towards Celtic. The match had been hyped by SKY for nearly two weeks. With the match kicking off at 18:05 on a Sunday (for the benefit of SKY) everyone had been at the bar all afternoon. The ensuing response from the crowd was ugly but somewhat predictable given these conditions, the championship deciding nature of the game, the warm weather, the booze and the &lsquo;antagonism&rsquo; towards Rangers. The debate about the game went on for a long time, with the media going into absolute feeding frenzy, their self-righteousness knowing no bounds. The events led to a change in all subsequent arrangements for Glasgow derbies. <br><br>The SFA launched an immediate inquiry into the game and events. Dallas had his windows panned in. A night of mayhem followed with clashes all over the place and hospital Casualty Deptartments full.

Paul Lambert downed Rod Wallace but Mahe protested stupidly at the foul  given against Celtic.<br>It was obvious then that a dangerously fragile temperament was  already seriously overloaded because of the tension sweeping down from  the steep tiers holding 59,918 highly-charged supporters.<br>Even so, Mahe&#39;s response after McCann had tackled him in 31 minutes still caused shock.<br>The defender made to lunge at his attacker and referee Hugh Dallas reached again for a yellow card before producing the red one.<br>Mahe should have had the sense to go as quietly as possible but he had been deserted by all reason.<br>He was like a man possessed and it was several minutes before some  kind of order could be restored as players from both sides pushed and  jostled.<br>All around the ground fans were on their feet, the vast majority of  them now convinced some kind of injustice had been perpetrated against  Celtic.<br>There is no doubt Mahe&#39;s ridiculous and irresponsible remonstrations  stoked the hatred which is always brought to these occasions.<br>It was not long afterwards when Rangers had won a free- kick deep on  the right inside Celtic&#39;s territory that a fan breached the security  cordon around the pitch and tried to get at Dallas.<br>The would-be attacker was caught and dragged away but then the  referee was struck by a coin and he required treatment to a head wound.<br>After the blood had been wiped and he had recovered, Dallas&#39;s next  decision was to award Rangers what appeared to be a soft penalty after  Vidar Riseth had cut across Tony Vidmar.<br>Celtic protested but Jorg Albertz was already deciding how he would blast the ball into Stewart Kerr&#39;s net.<br>The German did exactly that but only after a second fan had managed to get on the field of play.<br>A third idiot would get beyond the security men and a fourth was  caught just as he tried to get over the barrier before players were able  to concentrate fully on the game again.<br>McCann&#39;s goal had been set up for him by Wallace, who was sent off  in 75 minutes after he had made a threatening gesture when fouled by  Riseth.<br>Wallace had already been booked and he had to go while Riseth was cautioned.<br>However, the Norwegian was also dismissed after he lunged into Claudio Reyna.<br>In total Dallas, who did seem to make a series of strange decisions  which favoured Rangers, issued 10 bookings in a match played against a  poisonous backdrop and watched by tens of millions throughout Britain  and a number of foreign countries.<br>McCann scored Rangers&#39; third goal after Jonatan Johansson, who had  taken over from Gabriel Amato, played him into Celtic&#39;s box. McCann went  around Kerr and scored easily.<br>However, from the moment McCann scored his first goal a nightmare was unflooding for Celtic, who had been hit badly by injuries.<br>There was no Craig Burley, Regi Blinker was still missing as were  Lubomir Moravcik, Johan Mjallby, Jonathan Gould, Tom Boyd (suspended)  and Marc Rieper and Venglos had to take drastic action.<br>He gave Scott Marshall, brother of former Celtic keeper Gordon, his  first game since arriving on loan from Southampton and the defender must  be wishing he had never made the journey back north.<br>He didn&#39;t have a good debut and was unable to do anything about McCann&#39;s flashing runs and close control.<br>Venglos&#39;s bench told the story of his troubles because there were  three teenagers - Mark Burchill, Barry John Corr and Colin Healy -  sitting there along with Tommy Johnson, who hasn&#39;t kicked a ball for  Celtic since the days of Tommy Burns.<br>Celtic simply couldn&#39;t cope and even though they still had Henrik Larsson he continued to play like a mere mortal.<br>When Advocaat scanned Celtic&#39;s line-up he must have known he would  have the last laugh at Celtic Park where he had suffered back in  November when Celtic had beaten Rangers 5-1.<br>The triumph also allowed Rangers to steal a psychological advantage  for the Tennents Scottish Cup final later this month when more than  50,000 Old Firm fans again will come together, this time at the new  Hampden.<br>Hopefully tempers will have subsided by then because Scottish  football can do without another display of such hatred and intolerance.<br>The din at five minutes after six which split the the air over  Celtic Park signalled the significance of this encounter and when Celtic  went into their huddle seconds before the ball started rolling in  earnest, the noise must have carried over all of Glasgow.<br>However, Celtic&#39;s fans were silenced after only a couple of minutes  when Rangers surged forward and Albertz was allowed to gallop into  shooting distance.<br>He didn&#39;t release the trigger and instead slipped a pass to McCann  whose shot was blocked by Mahe, although the ball broke loose and  bounced off Rico Annoni before landing in the arms of Kerr.<br>Stefan Klos was also tested early but he was equal to the task and  punched clear Morten Wieghorst&#39;s corner from the left even though he was  under pressure from Marshall.<br>A few minutes later Celtic brought the pace of Harald Brattbakk into  force and suddenly the lack of speed in Rangers&#39; defence was exposed.<br>Lorenzo Amoruso had to lean heavily and illegally on Brattbakk to  prevent him from sprinting towards Klos and although Larsson took the  free-kick Rangers cleared.<br>Giovanni van Bronckhorst took possession, brought Wallace - who had  appeared unmarked on the left-hand side - into play and the little  striker, playing just off the front line, raced into Celtic&#39;s box.<br>He clipped the ball back into the path of McCann, who jabbed out a leg and prodded the ball into the net.<br>Only 12 minutes gone and Celtic were behind and facing a huge test  of their character but even allowing for their injury problems they  failed miserably.<br>Mark Viduka tried to menace with his power play but on the whole  Amoruso and Colin Hendry coped comfortably although Wieghorst, released  by Viduka, should have scored instead of hitting the ball a foot wide of  Klos&#39;s right-hand post.<br>While the players were indoors trying to catch their breath after a  frantic first half even by Old Firm standards, the groundstaff were busy  picking up the missiles which had been thrown on to the pitch.<br>Kerr was booked in 52 minutes after a bizarre error. He rolled the  ball in front of him as he trotted out of his box to start a move, but  he dithered and McCann pounced.<br>The winger blocked the clearance and the ball bounced into Kerr&#39;s arms but he was a yard out of his area.<br>Amato could have punished him further from the free-kick but Kerr  got his body behind the shot and was relieved to see the ball soar into  the air and over his bar.<br>A few minutes later Brattbakk was clear on the edge of Rangers&#39;  penalty area and sent in a good low shot which Klos did well to knock  away and then, at the opposite end, McCann wriggled away from Lambert  and should have done more than shoot straight at Kerr who saved with his  legs.<br>If the first half was frantic the opening to the second spell was  utterly chaotic but in the end Rangers deserved their triumph and the  title.<br>DREAM TEAM MAN OF THE MATCH: McCann (Rangers).<br><br><h3>Celtic 0-3 Rangers <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/scottish_premier/334094.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[BBC]</a></h3>  Rangers  created history by winning the title at Celtic Park in a stormy Old  Firm game which saw referee Hugh Dallas injured by a missile thrown from  the pitch.  <br>One of the game&#39;s few homegrown stars, Neil McCann  scored two of the goals to give Rangers a first championship win in  their rivals&#39; ground.  But his contribution is probably the only  consolation to the country&#39;s football authorities after disgraceful  scenes inside the ground.  <br>Television pictures beamed around the  world showed referee Hugh Dallas with blood seeping down his forehead  after being struck by a missile thrown from the crowd.  The German Jorg  Albertz scored the other Rangers goal - a controversial penalty given by  the referee just seconds after his first half injury was treated by  paramedics.  The incident which sparked off the protests was the 32nd  minute dismissal of Celtic&#39;s Stephane Mahe, with Rangers already a goal  up.  And although the second half was played in a calmer atmosphere it  still saw two more dismissals with Rod Wallace and Vidar Riseth sent off  in the last 10 minutes.  <br>The game had begun with the first foul  committed after 22 seconds and the second before the minute was up.  The  early stages were too combative for either side to gain the upper hand,  although both looked threatening and defenders needed to keep their  concentration.  Celtic failed to do so in the 12th minute and Wallace  was allowed to break behind a square defence.  The former Leeds man  squared the ball and McCann ran in ahead of the desperate men in  green-and-white to tuck it past a stranded Kerr from five yards.  <br>The  goal raised the temperature on the field and Mahe received a first  booking for a challenge on Wallace as Celtic tempers threatened to boil  over.  On 20 minutes Morten Wieghorst had a superb chance to equalise as  the Rangers defence allowed him to run in to the right-hand side of the  box.  Klos closed him down and the Dane curled the ball inches wide of  the keeper&#39;s right hand post.  <br><b>Game erupts</b>   <br>Then came the first moment of controversy after  Mahe was tripped by McCann.  <br>The  Frenchman chased after the former Hearts winger although did not appear  to touch him as he shouted to Dallas.  The referee produced a second  yellow, presumably for dissent, and Mahe was eventually led off in tears  while McCann was also booked for his challenge.  Rangers were then  given a free kick almost by the corner flag, preceding a violent  incident seen by television viewers in 26 countries around the world.   There was a lengthy delay before the official was seen with blood  seeping down his forehead and was treated by paramedics.  <br>But if the  referee was worried about his own safety he did not show it with his  next action, bravely giving Rangers a penalty after Tony Vidmar went  down in the area.  The award brought more fans onto the pitch as public  order was seriously threatened. Another appeared to fall from a top tier  of the stadium during the chaos and was stretchered away.  The second  half began with thankfully calmer scenes, although there was controversy  when Celtic keeper Kerr handled outside his penalty area.  It looked  like a mandatory dismissal for the keeper but referee Dallas may have  decided discretion was the better part of valour and produced a yellow  card.  <br>Kerr made the most of his reprieve by turning the resulting  free kick inches over after the Celtic wall parted.  Just before the  hour McCann had a chance to all but seal victory when he was put through  one-on-one but again Kerr denied Rangers with his leg.  But any hopes  that Celtic had of an unlikely comeback were destroyed by McCann who  broke through again on 76 minutes.  This time he rounded Kerr and  slotted the ball into the empty net.  After that the game threatened to  turn even uglier when Wallace and Riseth were dismissed.  The Englishman  was the first to go, although why he was sent off was not clear after  he tangled with Riseth.  The Celtic midfielder was booked before getting  his marching orders a minute from time for the last of a series of bad  challenges.<br>  <b>Risky celebration</b>  <br>There was one  final controversy. The Rangers players went to their supporters at the  final whistle despite police hopes that any title win would not be  celebrated on the Parkhead pitch.  Some Celtic fans stayed behind and  there were more missiles thrown at the players as they finally made  their way to the dressing room.<br>  <font size="2"><b> Celtic:</b>  Kerr, Annoni, Marshall, Stubbs, Riseth, Mahe, Lambert, Wieghorst,  Larsson, Viduka, Brattbakk.

The Frenchman at first refused to leave the field but finally went with his shirt pulled over his head.  <br><br>  Mahe and Riseth automatically will miss the clash at East End Park. Wallace sits out Rangers&#39; home fixture with Hearts on Sunday as well as the game against Motherwell on May 16 after going over the 16-point threshold.  <br><br>  Tuesday&#39;s SFA inquiry will be chaired by SFA vice-president Chris Robinson. An SFA statement said: &quot;It will look at what positive steps can be taken to create a safe venue and an enjoyable event when the clubs meet on May 29 in the Tennents Scottish CupFinal and on any future occasion.&quot;  <br><br>  Celtic are bracingthemselves for what looks like being a severe penalty and are trying hard to catch the troublemakers.  <br><br>  They have set up a hotline for supporters to give information about the people who caused problems.  <br><br>  Club spokesman Peter McLean said: &quot;Celtic urges anyone with information regarding the individuals who caused the regrettable events which occurred at Sunday&#39;s match to contact the hotline so that the culprits can be dealt with.&quot;  <br><br>  Celtic&#39;s new chief executive, Allan MacDonald, apologised to Dallas after the coin-throwing incident which led to the match official having four stitches placed in a head wound.  <br><br>  SPLchief Roger Mitchell welcomed next week&#39;s inquiry, but defended the 6.05 kick-off time many claimed allowed fans time to get drunk. He said: &quot;There has been an over-reaction to the kick-off time.  <br><br>  &quot;Of course we will look at it, but I think too much emphasis is being put on it.  <br><br>  &quot;The Old Firm game at New Year took place at the same time and there were only three arrests.  <br><br>  &quot;Look at the riot which took place after Feyenoord won the championship in Holland, there were people shot in the streets.  <br><br>  &quot;I don&#39;t think that had anything to do with the kick-off time.&quot;          COPYRIGHT 1999 Scottish Daily Record &amp; Sunday<br><br><h3>FOOTBALL: BARNES BLASTS HIS BAD BHOYS.    </h3>    NEW boss John Barneshas handed Celtic&#39;s undisciplined players a behave-or-else warning, writes DAVIDLEGGAT.  <br><br>  Barnes has promised he will not stand for an action replay of the red card blizzard which blitzed Celtic last season. And anyone who steps out of line runs the risk of being AXED by the new Parkhead coach.  <br><br>  Celtic were hit by EIGHT red cards during their season of shame. Seven men were handed their marching orders, with fiery Frenchman Stephane Mahe being sent off TWICE. Barnes said: &quot;I&#39;ve already spoken with Stephane and told him it is no use to me if he is banned, for it is the team which suffers.  <br><br>  &quot;It can affect him, and any other player who is out with a suspension too, for they may not get back in the team.  <br><br>  &quot;That applies to players being sent off and collecting bookings which leads to them being banned. I know we are all different, but in 20 years I was only booked twice and never sent off. Stephane says he knows he has to control himself and understands what he has to do.&quot;  <br><br>  Mahe will miss the start of the season after picking up an extra two- match ban, following his red card horror in the Old Firm shame game.  <br><br>  Vidar Risethwas also sent off in that match, and the following week controversial striker Mark Vidukagot a red card for spitting at a Dunfermline player.  <br><br>  The others to be sent off last season were skipper Tommy Boyd, Paul Lambert, Johan Mjallby and Darren Jackson, who is now with Hearts.  <br><br>  Barnes is the boss: Page 58          COPYRIGHT 1999 MGN LTD<br><br><h3>  FOOTBALL: Mahe apologies for Old Firm fracas</h3>Wyn Griffiths<br><br>Thursday 06 May 1999<br>Independent<br>STEPHANE MAHE, the Celtic defender, has been coerced into making a humiliating apology following his dismissal in the Old Firm mayhem last Sunday.<br><br>The French full-back has been widely condemned for his actions during the championship showdown at Parkhead, when he was dismissed for two bookable offences.<br><br>Mahe was enraged after he was fouled by Rangers&#39; match-winner Neil McCann and was shown the red card by the referee, Hugh Dallas, as he remonstrated with the World Cup official. He then refused to leave the field, having to be dragged off in tears.<br><br>His actions sparked angry scenes from the Celtic fans as they pelted the Rangers players with missiles, and Dallas needed four stitches in a head wound after being hit by a coin thrown from the stands.<br><br>Initially, Mahe remained unrepentant, insisting that he had done nothing wrong and did not deserve the punishment which had been meted out.<br><br>He claimed the problems had all been caused by Dallas, whose performance he described as &quot;not very good&quot;.<br><br>However, after a lengthy meeting with the Celtic chief executive, Allan MacDonald, Mahe has changed his opinion.<br><br>Together with his Norwegian team-mate, Vidar Riseth, Mahe has publicly apologised for his conduct during the game, agreeing it was unacceptable.<br><br>&quot;Allan MacDonald has made it clear in the strongest terms that the club will not accept anything other than the highest standards of behaviour from its players,&quot; Mahe said. &quot;I have been heavily fined and seriously censured by the Club, which I fully accept and respect.<br><br>&quot;I would like to make a full apology to the Celtic supporters, my fellow players, the Celtic management, the match officials and the general public for my behaviour, which I fully acknowledge was unacceptable.

Scottish football was quite simply a different place afterwards.<br><br>No fewer than 360 police incidents were logged before, during and after this 3-0 Rangers victory, a total of 113 arrests shared out between the ground and the city centre. When these two teams had drawn on a wet, cold night at Ibrox that January, there had been only three.<br><br>While more than 300 fans clashed in Duke Street, and a stabbing took place on Shettleston Road, while referee Hugh Dallas finished the match with four stitches in a head wound caused by a coin thrown from the Celtic end. That shocking incident, not to mention the four intruders who invaded the field of play trying to reach him, illustrated outright antipathy towards the match official, who had sent off three players in all - Stephane Mahe and Vidar Riseth of Celtic, and Rangers&#39; Rod Wallace - and awarded a hotly disputed penalty in favour of the visitors. The Dallas family home in Carfin was raided by one of his neighbours that night, while even officially Celtic cast aspersions against the whistler. Chief Executive Allan McDonald resigned shortly after claiming that body language expert Chris Lewis had effectively proved Dallas was biased.<br><br>Reliving the footage on youTube is akin to entering a time warp but for the major protagonists the intervening 16 years have done little to dull the memories. With the hype machine in overdrive - the back page of a morning tabloid proclaimed &#39;Park Dread Crunch&#39; and invoked the memory of the 1980 Scottish Cup final riot - it didn&#39;t take long for the players to sense that even by the standards of the Old Firm fixture this would be an extraordinary day. &quot;There were so many drunk people everywhere,&quot; recalls Riseth.<br><br>In truth, the odds were always likely to be stacked against Dr Jo Venglos and his side. Of the squad which routed Rangers 5-1 in November 1998, injury and suspension deprived him of Craig Burley, Lubomir Moravcik, Johan Mjallby, Tom Boyd, Jonathan Gould and Marc Rieper. Scott Marshall was pressed into a debut. Rangers sensed blood.<br><br>&quot;I can still remember vividly what it was like going in on the bus,&quot; said Neil McCann, given the nod to start up front alongside Gabriel Amato. &quot;There were no nerves among the Rangers players. Just a belief I had never experienced before. We knew what we were going to achieve.&quot;<br><br>It took just 12 minutes for Advocaat&#39;s scheming to pay dividends. Giovanni van Bronckhorst fed Wallace down the left, and his low cross was turned in by McCann.<br><br>By 30 minutes, the red mist was descending, fast. The anger coalesced around the figure of Dallas and his apparently malign involvement with Stephane Mahe. The combustible Frenchman had picked up an early booking in a tussle with Wallace. While he complained bitterly that the Englishman had elbowed him in the torso, in truth to watch the incident now is to see a player out of control, aggressively confronting the referee.<br><br>&quot;Stephane was a little bit too high,&quot; recalled Riseth. &quot;He wanted to go out there, tackle and win everything, but he gave a little bit too much. You could see it before he went out on the pitch.&quot;<br><br>When - with 31 minutes on the clock - the same player reacted angrily again to a tackle by the backtracking McCann, his fate was sealed. The Scotland winger was booked while Mahe received a second yellow, requiring to be cajoled and man-handled away from the referee and off the pitch by his team-mates and assistant manager Eric Black.<br><br>&quot;You could tell the Celtic players were keyed up,&quot; said McCann. &quot;Stephane was right on edge. He cut back in and I caught him, foot-sweeped him. I put my hands up to say &#39;sorry ref&#39; but he was coming at me so I got a wee bit antsy as well and I got booked. But he just wouldn&#39;t calm down. He went absolutely crazy and I think it was down to the sheer occasion.&quot;<br><br>It was then that a strange level of anarchy took hold, chaos reaching a crescendo as Van Bronckhorst stood over a free kick near the corner flag. No sooner had the first of the day&#39;s intruders been apprehended than Dallas was down on all fours, blood streaming from his hairline.<br><br>There was no respite from the bedlam. The resultant free-kick finally arrived, only for the freshly patched-up match official to deem a rather innocuous piece of grappling between Riseth and Tony Vidmar at the far post was worthy of a penalty. A bemused Paul Lambert is captured walking over to the ref, vainly suggesting his head injury might have been responsible. &quot;I don&#39;t remember so much about that,&quot; said Riseth, &quot;but I could see the ref was struggling after he got the coin off his head.&quot;<br><br>Sandwiched between two more pitch invasions, Jorg Albertz swept in the penalty. Half-time mercifully arrived, shortly after a Celtic fan fell from the upper tier and was stretchered off to hospital, ignoring medical advice by waving cheerfully to all and sundry.<br><br>&quot;The place was an absolute ferment,&quot; recalls Willie McDougall, the watching SFA security chief, who also had one eye on the upcoming Scottish Cup final between the two teams later that month. &quot;I was there as security adviser, I am taking notes on all this, and I was thinking &#39;what are the implications here if this match was abandoned?&#39; I thought we were very much at that stage. All credit to Dallas, and I told him that after the match, for getting up and keeping going, because if the fourth official had had to come on it would have deteriorated.&quot;<br><br>&quot;As soon as the first few fans start coming on, that was when the alarm bells start ringing,&quot; said McCann. &quot;Listen, for a referee to get struck on the head, or to be attacked, there is no place for any of that. I was thinking &#39;how many more could come on here?&#39; What if a few hundred come on? We had all seen the footage of the 1980 riot and I knew my family were up there in the away end. All these thoughts are racing through your head.&quot;<br><br>McCann recalls feeling &#39;untouchable&#39; that day, and his own day at the office would only get better. After some more close things - including one long-forgotten incident when he blocked a Stewart Kerr clearance, leaving the goalkeeper standing, a metre outside his area, clutching the ball, only to be booked - he was running through on goal once again. He made sure to avoid the keeper&#39;s wing span, finished crisply, and before long his momentum was taking him round behind the goal, Dallas even giving his jersey a wee tug to steer him from the stands. &quot;All I could hear was Hugh Dallas shouting &#39;Neil, you are on a booking, I am going to send you off if you start anything&#39;,&quot; McCann recalled.<br><br>There was further carnage to come, though, the normally becalmed Riseth the man on the rampage. First was a wild challenge on Rod Wallace, only for the enraged Englishman to be sent packing, before his own dismissal was confirmed with a crazy lunge on Claudio Reyna in the right back area.<br><br>&quot;I went in for the tackle, so I couldn&#39;t really understand why Rod Wallace was sent off,&quot; Riseth admitted. &quot;As for my sending off, I just remember I didn&#39;t even look at the referee. I was so sure it was a red card I just headed directly for the tunnel.&quot;<br><br>Soon Rangers players were doing likewise. Their ill-advised post match decision to provoke the home supporters with an improvised huddle led to them sprinting for safety in a hail of missiles.<br><br>&quot;Although we had started it in front of our own fans in hindsight it wasn&#39;t the smartest thing to do at Celtic Park,&quot; said McCann. &quot;We had to make a run for it. Then I almost had to get a human shield from two security guys just to get onto the bus.&quot;<br><br>After a title party and overnight stay in a local hotel, McCann would awake the next day to find his family home in Livingston vandalised and his big moment tarnished. &quot;I felt a wee bit deflated because we had just won the league, achieved a massive bit of history, and most of the headlines were all about the shame game,&quot; he said. &quot;What we did that day was almost forgotten. I remember a wee tinge of sadness about it.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><br></div>
