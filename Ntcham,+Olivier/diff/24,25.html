The cursed comparison to a big name player was a burden he couldn&#39;t live up to initially, but he was to make a name for himself, albeit often inconsistently. <br><div><br>Celtic were on a high after the incredible domestically undefeated treble season of 2016-17, and surprised everyone by paying a relatively hefty price tag for this young starlet. Some of the early words on his arrival were positive about his potential, and after the success of Dembele in the past season was it asking a lot to hope he could mirror that Dembele debut season? Possibly a bit too much to ask for.<br><br>He had a tough start, but Olivier Ntcham truly arrived at the vital qualifier match v Astana. He was bought for these occasions; he was fabulous, his touch, strength &amp; eye for a pass, superb performance. It appeared that Celtic had bagged a superb player. <br><br>However he had much to learn, as a really poor performance from Ntcham v Anderlecht away saw a wayward performance highlight his weaknesses, but it didn&#39;t affect his long term commitment and he grew into his role in the midfield alongside Brown and others. <br><br>Over the season he grew into his role and soon was lauded as Celtic pushed towards a back to back treble. Excellent performances against TheRangers in trouncing their over-rated sides, put Ntcham at the forefront. If anything, he had proven to be a talent ahead of his years, and alongside Scott Brown was a bulwark in the first team. As Scott Armstrong was out injured, it provided Ntham the scope to cement his position, and that he did, although there was squad rotation.<br><br>As Celtic marched on towards the treble, it was clear what it all meant to him. He was clearly happy at Celtic, and was showing his worth, and was to extend his contract. He was developing and growing as a player. <br><br>Season 2018-19 though was a poor season to him, not helped by that he was lost due to injuries for spells in the season, his general form and demeanour was below par, and concerns were over his place. In various matches, he could be a lost place in the side, which surprised all. Problem also were concerns that he was looking disinterested. Especially with Brown getting older and requiring support and then the loss of Rodgers as manager, it really needed Ntcham to step up, but the general consensus is that his effort was lacking.<br><br>Some were putting it down to a small French tight knit clique at Celtic and with Dembele gone, the unit was a little weaker and less interested. Edouard also was seen as less productive in his second season but was still performing in major matches. Ntcham was seen as out-of sorts.<br><br>As Celtic marched onto the incredible domestic Treble-Treble, Ntcham was increasingly seen as not pivotal, and junior members of the squad were ahead in the queue, which was concerning.<br><br>Celtic were often a much better, fitter, stronger, more intelligent, more creative team when Olivier Ntcham starts but it needed Ntcham to find his feet. The loss of manager Brendan Rodgers prematurely leaving during the 2018/19 season didn&#39;t help.<br><br>In July 2019, Ntcham had an interview with French magazine <i>L&#39;Equipe</i> fishing for a move away, criticising Scottish football but in fairness not Celtic. He claimed the lack of quality is Scotland was hindering him:<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;Celtic brought me a lot, it&rsquo;s the best solution for my development.  Games come one after the other, but with the respect I have for my  opponents, if the level isn&rsquo;t high you don&rsquo;t progress, I was  disappointed I didn&rsquo;t go to Porto last summer&rdquo;</i><br></blockquote><br>You can see an argument, but he was not always performing to his potential best, and Scottish football hadn&#39;t hindered Tierney, Van Dijk or Dembele who all had achieved far more than Ntcham. It was premature from Ntcham, and as he had not wholly succeeded at Man City or at Genoa (loan spell in Italy) he should have been more aware that the grass isn&#39;t always greener on the other side.<br><br><br>[2019: note add on Lazio goal; later winner by a black African muslim that sunk their club with a fascist following...]<br><br>[....]</div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3"

The adulation from the supporters and a sizeable wage also help. Celtic have a raft of incentives they can wave under the nose of potential signings these days but the possibility of playing in the Champions League remains the biggest carrot of the lot.<br><br>Olivier Ntcham admits as much, too. The 21 year-old, who completed his transfer from Manchester City yesterday for a fee in the region of &pound;4.5m, signing a four-year deal, is enthused about the prospect of playing for a side competing for silverware after spending the last two seasons on loan at relegation-threatened Genoa.<br><br>His friend and long-time French team-mate Moussa Dembele has also told him about the Celtic fans and the warm reception he can expect. But it is the notion of playing in Europe&rsquo;s premier club competition that has proved the biggest lure for the midfielder as he looks to kick-start his career after two largely frustrating seasons in Italy.<br><br>Granted, it is not guaranteed. Celtic will need to scrap their way through three increasingly difficult qualifying ties just to reach the group stage. Should they manage it, however, then in a few months&rsquo; time Ntcham could find himself lining up against sides of the calibre of Barcelona, Bayern Munich or Real Madrid. For a young player hoping to make a name for himself in the game, it serves as a colossal incentive.<br><br>&ldquo;What persuaded me to come here? The Champions League,&rdquo; he revealed. &ldquo;Not every player can play in this competition and that is why I came here. I never had the chance to play Champions League football in my career before. I have heard that it is unbelievable to play in and that is what I want to do with Celtic.&rdquo;<br><br>Ntcham does not expect to feature against Linfield in the first of those qualifying rounds but feels it will not be be long before he starts to make an impact. Describing himself as a &ldquo;box to box&rdquo; midfielder, the France under-21 player believes he has a versatility that allows him to perform either just behind the centre forward or in a deeper-lying role. &ldquo;I like to play more [forward] on the pitch but I can play all of the central midfield positions as a number 8, 6, or 10. I am a strong, physical player.&rdquo;<br><br>One of Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; main attributes last season was drawing more out of players with untapped potential. Ntcham is confident the Celtic manager can do the same for him. If Italian football, and Genoa in particular, did not play to this strengths, then Rodgers has convinced him he will be enjoy greater success in the Scottish game.<br><br>&ldquo;The manager spoke to me and told me that the Italian league did not suit my style of football,&rdquo; revealed the one-time Le Havre prospect. &ldquo;He felt that it was not the right fit for me because it was more tactical and everything was different.<br><br>&ldquo;The manager believes that I would be best suited to the Scottish game and the way Celtic play. I learned a lot of tactical stuff in Italy. It has made me a better tactical player because in terms of tactics Italy is the best football place in the world. And we did running...a lot!&rdquo;<br><br>Ntcham did not struggle for role models as a young lad growing up on the outskirts of Paris. Zinedine Zidane was the most obvious midfield influence, while more recently he has followed closely the journey taken by Paul Pogba.<br><br>&ldquo;When you see French players being successful you want to be like them,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Zidane was my hero and my example to follow growing up. I played against Juventus three or four times when I was in Italy. I enjoyed playing against Pogba when he was there because he is also French and we had good battles in the midfield.<br><br>&ldquo;I like the way he plays and he is someone that I try to copy in my style on the pitch. When I arrived at Le Havre, he had left to go to Manchester United for the first time. But we came through the same youth system.&rdquo;<br><br>Dembele, of course, is another familiar face, the pair having played together in the youth teams of the France national side since they were teenagers.<br><br>&ldquo;I have known Moussa and played with him since we were 14 years old in the national teams,&rdquo; he revealed. &ldquo;He has told me about the atmosphere at Celtic Park and that the fans are unbelievable. He also told me about the Rangers games here in Glasgow and how unbelievable they are as a player.&rdquo;<br><br>The reported &pound;4.5m fee is one of the biggest outlays by Celtic in recent times but Ntcham is not fazed by the level of expectation that may bring.<br><br>&ldquo;No, the money does not put pressure on me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For me, it makes me happy because the club is showing a lot of faith in me.<br><br>&ldquo;When you buy a player, you buy him because he can do big things on the pitch. I hope this is what I can show for Celtic. The money is not a problem. It is a challenge and I am looking forward to it.&rdquo;<br><a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/15406561.Olivier_Ntcham_reveals_Euro_vision_after_signing_four_year_deal_with_Celtic/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.heraldscotland.com/Ntcham_reveals_Euro_vision</font></a></div><br>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><h3>The Sun July 2017:</h3><div>HE&rsquo;S the most expensive Celtic signing in a decade &mdash; but Olivier Ntcham insists he&rsquo;s not under extra pressure to perform.<br><br>It&rsquo;s ten years since the Hoops last wrote a cheque for &pound;4million.<br><br>Back then it was used to bring a certain Scott Brown along the M8 from Hibs.<br><br>Yesterday, that same fee secured the services of Ntcham from Manchester City on a four-year deal.<br><br>Midfield powerhouse Ntcham, 21, is Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; third signing of the summer.<br><br>He won&rsquo;t play against Linfield tomorrow night but the Frenchman is desperate for his new club to reach the Champions League group stages again.<br><br>Ntcham said: &ldquo;No, the money does not put pressure on me.

My fitness is not good enough for me to play straight away yet, but my body weight is good. I am looking forward to the challenge. Everything is different here with Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;In Italy, when you play for Genoa you know you are not going to finish in first position.<br><br>&ldquo;The big clubs with the most money finish in that position.<br><br>&ldquo;At Genoa you know the main thing is to fight to stay in the league every season.<br><br>&ldquo;But at Celtic, you want to win every single thing you play in.

Even the most reactionary of fans should know that. However, supporters will always rest easier when a new signing&rsquo;s debut goes smoothly, especially when he&rsquo;s the most expensive signing the club have made in a decade.<br><br> Olivier Ntcham will face many tougher opponents than Linfield. In fact, with all due respect, there&rsquo;s a chance every opponent he faces this season will be tougher than the part-time side from the Irish League. Therefore, one must refrain from anointing him as the next big thing to come to Scottish football. And yet, it must be said, he looked pretty damn impressive during his first 60 minutes in a Celtic shirt.<br><br> The Frenchman started the match as part of the midfield two in Celtic&rsquo;s unorthodox, but no less effective, 3-1-2-3-1 formation. Though his partner may have been Callum McGregor, it was Scott Sinclair whom he regularly interacted with during the match. Last season&rsquo;s Player of the Year was tasked with keeping the shape of the side, and therefore he stayed wide more often than we&rsquo;re used to see from the predatory midfield who loves to drift into central areas. It was Ntcham&rsquo;s job to feed him the football.<br> <br> In order to do so, Ntcham would often drop a little deeper, almost alongside sitting midfielder Scott Brown, and pick up possession before moving it swiftly on. Some new signings can disappear into the background of games, unsure of how to make an impact amid a team of unfamiliar faces. Ntcham was the opposite. He wanted the football.<br> <br> Once in possession, he would knock a five or ten-yard pass to a team-mate in space. Linfield sat so deep that it wasn&rsquo;t hard to find another hooped shirt in the vicinity. He did, however, show off a bit of range with two crossfield passes in the opening period, both of which found their targets in the gap behind the full-back and the byline.<br> <br> What became quickly apparent about Ntcham&rsquo;s style was the quickness in which he wanted to move the ball. It was control, touch, pass. Control, touch, pass. Fellow midfielder Nir Bitton has often been criticised by Celtic fans for slowing the tempo down too much, almost being too composed with the ball at his feet. From initial impressions it doesn&rsquo;t look like Ntcham is going to be that sort of player.<br> <br> What he does like to do is have a pop at goal whenever the opportunity arises. Overall he had six strikes at the Linfield net, though most were either blocked or deflected. This included Celtic&rsquo;s opener, when Sinclair was alert to a loose ball and finished at a narrow angle.<br> <br> In addition to his enthusiasm for driving the ball towards goal, Ntcham also showed the ability to take it for a run when the timing was right. Showing deceptive quickness for someone with such a robust frame, he beat two players on a Celtic counter attack around the 40-minute mark before winning a foul 30 yards from goal. Earlier in the half he coolly, under pressure, dummied the ball and ran around his opponent to keep an attack going.<br> <br> In the end, he played a significant part in all three goals scored while he was on the field. There may have been an element of luck in two of them, but in football you make your own luck sometimes. The urgency in which he struck the first shot caught the Linfield defence cold, and they were unable to deal with it properly. And his pass for the third may have been wayward, but he showed great drive and intuition to take the pass, move it quickly and then dart into the open space.<br> <br> It was an encouraging hour and left Celtic fans in great anticipation for what&rsquo;s going to come next.<br><br></font></font><h3>   </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><h3><br>Blunt advice Celtic star Olivier Ntcham opens up on his upbringing which could have seen the game lose him to BREAKDANCING<br></h3><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"><br>The &pound;4million ace expects his mum to be bursting with pride when she watches him walk out at the Parc des Princes on November 22<br><div class="spoiler_toggle"><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/1467547/olivier-ntcham-celtic-psg-champions-league-breakdancing-basketball-advice/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"><font color="#0066cc">https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/1467547/olivier-ntcham-celtic-psg-champions-league-breakdancing-basketball-advice/</font></a></div><div class="spoiler"><br>By Derek McGregor <br>AS a ten-year-old, the only hoops Olivier Ntcham was interested in were basketball ones.<br>Only blunt advice from mum Anne Marie stopped him from abandoning football.<br><br>No wonder the Celtic star now expects her to be bursting with pride when she watches him walk out at the Parc des Princes on November 22 to face Neymar, the world&rsquo;s most expensive player, and his PSG pals.<br>Ntcham made it clear in the aftermath of group-stage qualification in Astana that he&rsquo;d love to play his childhood favourites in the glitziest club competition in the game.<br>And after getting his wish via the Champions League draw in Monaco, the &pound;4million ace opened up on an extraordinary upbringing which could also have seen the game lose him to BREAKDANCING.<br><br>Paris-born Ntcham is thrilled with the idea of testing his ability against &pound;198m man Neymar.<br>He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very exciting draw and I&rsquo;m happy because I wanted to play against PSG.<br>&ldquo;I come from Paris. It&rsquo;s special for me because when I was young I was a big PSG fan.<br>&ldquo;I always follow the transfer stories &mdash; PSG have again spent a lot of money!<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ll have played against their first team. My hero as a kid was Pauleta, the striker. I loved him when he was on the pitch.<br>&ldquo;I have two friends at the club &mdash; central defender Presnel Kimpembe and midfielder Adrien Rabiot &mdash; and I played against them when we were younger a couple of times.<br>&ldquo;I watched PSG games on the television but I was never able to see them at the stadium.<br><br>&ldquo;All my family are in Paris. It&rsquo;s too early for them to have been in touch, but I know they will be very excited.<br>&ldquo;It will be very emotional for my mum and dad to see me play at the Parc des Princes. They will be full of pride.<br>&ldquo;When I was young, I was in Canada for two years. I wanted to stop playing football to play basketball instead.<br>&ldquo;But my mother said, &lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t stop, you must continue playing football.&rsquo;<br><br>&ldquo;So it will be emotional for her now. I was ten or 11 years old. I feel I owe my mother a lot because of her telling me to stick with football.<br>&ldquo;I was very serious about stopping football. In Canada, we didn&rsquo;t play outside because it was too cold. We played five against five indoors and, after two years, I wanted to stop. But she said, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stop&rsquo;.<br>&ldquo;She never watched me play football, but for some reason she just felt I had to continue playing. I&rsquo;m glad I did.<br>&ldquo;I only started playing football when I was ten years old. Quite late, yes, but before that I was a breakdancer. It was between breakdancing and football.<br>&ldquo;I performed with my older brother. He still does it. I also liked boxing a lot.<br>&ldquo;I used to breakdance outside, in front of people, putting on shows in the streets.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not shown my dancing skills here yet &mdash; I haven&rsquo;t even told my team-mates.&rdquo;<br><br>Asked if he would celebrate with a bit of breakdancing if he were to score a winner against PSG, he laughed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hope to do that!&rdquo;<br>Bayern Munich and Anderlecht make up a stunning Group B for Celtic &mdash; and Ntcham has a friend and hero in the Germans&rsquo; squad.<br>He said: &ldquo;I know Kingsley Coman because we played together for the national team.<br>&ldquo;Franck Ribery is a player I have always admired a lot. It is incredible how his career has developed. In France, we have an academy but he didn&rsquo;t come through the academy level.<br>&ldquo;He went elsewhere, played a lot of football and got a move straight to Marseille. Then he went to Bayern Munich.<br>&ldquo;The way he came through was a lot harder. He has been a big inspiration for me.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic are viewed as the section&rsquo;s underdogs &mdash; but Ntcham refuses to write off their chances of qualifying for the last 16.<br>He said: &ldquo;This is a big part of why I&rsquo;m here and it was my target because we weren&rsquo;t sure if we would go through. My first target has been achieved, so I am happy.<br>&ldquo;Anything and everything can happen in football.

First came the social media slight on teammates as he headed for the Under 21 Euros with France at the beginning of last month. That was in the midst of interest from Lyon, Marseille and Porto some of which looked real. All of which went quiet when it was reported Celtic were looking for 15 million for the player.<br><br>Today Olivier is quoted in L&rsquo;equipe&hellip;&ldquo;Games came one after another but with respect to my opponents, if the level isn&rsquo;t high, you don&rsquo;t progress,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;What could be the perfect stage for me? A big championship: Germany, France, Spain &ndash; coming back to France would be something very, very good,&rdquo; he added.<br><br>&ldquo;The interest of the Marseille? It is flattering. It is a very big club with very big support. If I went to Marseille, I would blossom, I have always signed for clubs with lots of fans.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Celtic brought me a lot, it&rsquo;s the best solution for my development. Games come one after the other, but with the respect I have for my opponents, if the level isn&rsquo;t high you don&rsquo;t progress, I was disappointed I didn&rsquo;t go to Porto last summer&rdquo;<br><br>Let&rsquo;s start with his defence. We are aware the Scottish league is not the highest of standards when compared to others and it&rsquo;s not as if he&rsquo;s being disrespectful to Celtic as a club when he comments on the standard holding him back, it&rsquo;s in the opposition he faces and I do get that. Playing against better players regularly probably would improve a player, it&rsquo;s hard to argue otherwise.<br><br>His opinion that he should have moved to Porto in the summer could allude to promises being made. We&rsquo;ve already seen last season that Dembele initially received short shrift from the Celtic support with his last minute moves and public utterings that smacked of a ticket being worked, but that was before the Brendan Rodgers fallout showed that perhaps his actions were borne of frustration at what he saw as broken promises.<br><br>All that said from a professional standpoint it&rsquo;s a poor show from the player, though if he&rsquo;s working alone on this I&rsquo;d be surprised. The comments alone being made so publically will no doubt be dealt with by the Club and so they should. The timing of it 4 days before Celtic enter the first of possibly 4 rounds of Champions league qualifiers is disrespectful to the club and to his teammates again.<br><br>The player himself hasn&rsquo;t shown the consistency of play to even consider himself a first choice at Celtic Park. He&rsquo;s shown up well in some wonderful matches but he&rsquo;s rarely followed on. For every derby showing when he scored the winner last season at Celtic Park there&rsquo;s been an Easter Road where he&rsquo;d have struggled to pass water if requested, never mind find a teammate with the ball.<br><br>If you talk of outgrowing a league then before you comment on it publically at least be sure to have mastered it before you start deriding it. Ntcham has done nothing of the sort.<br><br>As for his revelation that he should have gone to Porto last year. Well in November last year he signed a new contract. A contract he was happy to sign, one that tied him to the club until 2022. After Porto&rsquo;s so called interest in signing him. Why do that if you are so keen to test yourself elsewhere? If you&rsquo;re angling for a more challenging work environment why not say no thanks for now I&rsquo;ll be looking for alternative employment in the next wee while. Thanks for the offer anyway.<br><br>What&rsquo;s changed now? Is the real reason for all this that he&rsquo;s not actually forced his way into the team?<br><br>Is he concerned that those in his homeland are likely to be asking that question and why in such a &lsquo;poor&rsquo; league he&rsquo;s not actually imposing himself. Is he worried his CV could be looking damaged?<br><br>Ntcham left Man City having failed to make a dent and went to Celtic and failed to influence enough. Doesn&rsquo;t look good when even his stint at Genoa seemed to lack for consistency.<br><br>Blaming his environment as holding him back as if to say he just can&rsquo;t motivate himself amongst his apparently dreadful peers might be enough for clubs to think perhaps they should take a chance. It may make them believe that he&rsquo;d blossom if he just had the right environment, where he&rsquo;d actually be motivated to perform every week?<br><br>But here&rsquo;s the rub. That won&rsquo;t be at Celtic&rsquo;s price and panic may be setting in. I&rsquo;m assuming Celtic have so far been steadfast on what price needs to be met before they agree to talk.<br><br>Is this all being engineered? Is the agent and therefore the player aware a particular club will buy? Are they also been made aware the only way that club will actually spend is if the fee is substantially lower than what Celtic want?<br><br>So what is likely to bring down the price from the selling club? Possibly one who&rsquo;s now annoyed his teammates not once but twice since the end of the season and one perhaps who if he did return could spread bad vibes and discontent like the common cold in a child&rsquo;s nursery.<br><br>That may explain earlier interest not being followed up at the price Celtic require. Marseille were interested but lack the financial clout to meet Celtic valuation. It&rsquo;s already public they need to sell before they buy and interest if ever concrete was unlikely at the asking price.<br><br>At Porto and Lyon I could see him around the squad but would he really be considered as a first eleven signing at either? If not are they really going to stretch to 15milion for a squad player? Probably not. How convenient then to have a player in the shop window of a much scouted European Under 21 competition now publically angling for a move. It all smacks of engineering a price drop, with a club, player and agent all working in cahoots.<br><br>There&rsquo;s one other possibility but I think it&rsquo;s unlikely. That Celtic are in some way complicit in this. The club&rsquo;s outlay on recent acquisitions could be construed as having assumed Ntcham would be sold to assist the profit and loss columns and that interest has now cooled. It could be a way to drop the price and safe face by saying we had to get rid of an unhappy player. It&rsquo;s possible but seeing as Ntcham actually started this on Instagram at the beginning of June I&rsquo;m more inclined to believe this is simply a tactic from agent and player.<br><br>So can this be saved, can he stay at Celtic?<br><br>If he hangs around for training he may be able to build bridges with teammates. We also know he lost a good friend in the dressing room when Dembele left. Would the likes of Christopher Jullien and Boli Bolingoli help him culturally with some French speakers around him perhaps help him feel a little more settled?<br><br>All possible but now probably unlikely. It&rsquo;s clear he wants out. It may be we have to look at lowering the asking price and give him what he wants. The other alternative is make him train away from the main squad and give him time to think and other clubs time to come in but that&rsquo;s possibly a tactic that could be detrimental to the harmony of a squad already looking to bed in new players.<br><br>For now it&rsquo;s looking like Olivier Ntcham is in the last throws of his brief and unfulfilled Celtic career. It&rsquo;s probably best for both sides if we find an amicable solution and move on.<br><br>Niall J<br><br><div>Also on The Celtic Star&hellip;<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>OLI GOOD SHOW: NTCHAM&rsquo;S &lsquo;BEAUTIFUL&rsquo; GOAL</h3>https://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/oli-good-show-ntchams-beautiful-goal/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<br>By CQN Magazine on 10th June 2020 Latest News<br><br>OLIVIER NTCHAM became a History Bhoy when he chipped in the stoppage-time winner against Lazio in the Stadio Olimpico in Rome on November 7.<br><br>As the Frenchman performed cartwheels with the ball nestling in the Serie A side&rsquo;s net, he not only gave Celtic a well-earned 2-1 triumph and three points in the Europa League Group B qualifying campaign.<br><br>Ntcham also shot himself into the club&rsquo;s Hall of Fame by becoming the player to give the Hoops their first win on Italian soil in 13 attempts.<br><br>And the &pound;4.5million former Manchester City midfielder picked up the Magners Goal of the Season award for his special dinked effort.<br><br>Ntcham, speaking to Celtic TV, said: &ldquo;It was a special moment for Celtic, a special moment for the team and a special moment for everybody, and thank you to all the fans who voted for my goal.<br><br>&ldquo;I started on the bench and I remember the coach said to me to try to play forward and try to make a difference when I came on &ndash; and I did. I scored a beautiful goal. It was a beautiful counter-attack, a good pass from Odsonne.<br><br>&ldquo;My first touch wasn&rsquo;t so nice, wasn&rsquo;t so great, but I think the finish was good.<br><br>TRES MAGNIFIQUE&hellip;Olivier Ntcham celebrates his historic goal in Rome.<br><br>&ldquo;It was crazy in the stands and I was really, really happy. I didn&rsquo;t know I was the first one to score to win a game in Italy. It was a great goal for me and I was so proud at that moment to play for Celtic and to be part of that.&rdquo;<br><br>The former French Under-21 international powerhouse, now 24, picked up his third Premiership winners&rsquo; medal after the champions&rsquo; ninth successive crown this time out.<br><br>Despite the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, Ntcham added: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a great season. It wasn&rsquo;t the easiest. I think it was a little bit tough for us because when you come back and you&rsquo;re the champions, everybody wants to beat you. All the teams progressed in that way and every team wants to play and score against us.<br><br>&ldquo;For us, it was the most difficult season because we lost some games, as well, but I think it was a great season to play and everybody can be happy that we achieved this target.<br><br>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m looking forward to training, first of all, and then I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing again and hoping everything is going to start soon. It is a big target, but we have to look from game to game<br><br>&ldquo;First of all, we have to start the season and then we can start talking about scoring goals and playing the beautiful game, but I hope everything&rsquo;s going to be right in the future and everyone will be able to enjoy the games again.&rdquo;  <h3></h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br><br></h3></div><div></div><div><br>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><div></div><br></div>
