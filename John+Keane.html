As Managing Director of Keane  Contracting Company (Edinburgh) Ltd, he carried out major contracts for  private and public companies including the predecessor companies to  British Gas plc and British Telecommunications plc. In the early 1980s  he established a number of property holding and development companies.  Through these and other activities, he has continued to be involved in  property development and investment, and currently acts as advisor to a  variety of family businesses. He joined the Celtic Group in September <a href="/page/1994" target="_self">1994</a>.<br></i><br>   Back in the dark days of the early 90s the club was stuck in the mire,  in the self destructive days of The Celtic Takeover. There were a  number of unheralded heroes during this period, and one of those was  John Keane. <br><br>He may not have had the much lauded position from  retrospectives of the period such has been given to luminaries like Brian  Dempsey, but John Dempsey played a card which few others would. A life  long Celtic fan, it was he who stumped up hard cash from his own funds  (est &pound;1m) to finance the club to avoid the ignominy of administration. <br><br>He  went on to support Fergus McCann when certain former allies chose not  to, and in time it was to be a brave and successful move for all. One  that Fergus McCann will surely be very thankful of. <br><br>He was  bestowed the honorary chairmanship of Celtic in 2013 as a reflection of  the respect the club has for him, a title which surely he will treasure.  Actually despite his personal success he is a modest man, but he was a  perfect fit for this crown. <br><br>As a further measure of the  gratitude of the club this unsung hero was rewarded with the honour of  raising the league title flag in 2013,at Celtic&#39;s 2-1 victory over Ross  County which allowed the general support to show their appreciation. <br><br>It  was a truly fitting tribute, and one man whom deserves more than just a  footnote in the retrospectives of the club during that turbulent time in  the early 90s.<br><br>John Keane retired in July 2019. A man of true humility and dignity, and a lifelong  Celtic supporter, John played a hugely significant role in preserving  the Club&rsquo;s history, success and, above all, continuity. John played a  pivotal role in saving Celtic for us all.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Flag Day honour is a fitting tribute to John Keane</h3>CelticFC.net<br><h3><img align="right" alt="John Keane - Kerrydale Street" height="280" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/wiki/kds/image/1TwwVt$A14fCi0E6kBp1QJg==59141/GW300H280" title="John Keane - Kerrydale Street" width="300"></h3>By: Brian Wilson on 02 Aug, 2013 16:19<br><br>WHEN  John Keane, the Honorary Chairman of Celtic Football and Athletic Club,  unfurls the League Championship flag at Celtic Park on Saturday  afternoon, he deserves an ovation to match the contribution he has made  to the history, success and &ndash; above all - continuity of Celtic Football  Club.<br><br>Back in the dark days of 1994, John was at home in  Edinburgh one evening when he received a call from Kevin Kelly, then the  Celtic chairman. The news was dire. The Bank of Scotland was about to  foreclose on Celtic.<br><br>The wages would not be paid. Administration was staring them in the face.<br>Kevin  Kelly had a straightforward question for John Keane: could he help the  club out of this dire predicament? John, who had forged a successful  business career over the previous 40 years and was already a Celtic  shareholder, did not have to think twice.<br><br>Looking back, he says: &ldquo;Administration was unthinkable. It would have been a slur upon the name of the Club.&rdquo;<br><br>An  immediate &pound;1million was needed to save Celtic from this ignominy and to  keep trading.

His  mother was from Crown Street in the Gorbals and his father met her when  he came to Scotland as an agricultural worker. <br><br>They settled  back in Mayo to raise the family but his mother&rsquo;s love of Celtic and the  Scottish newspapers that were posted over to her ensured that John was  familiar with the club and its traditions from an early age.<br><br>At  the age of 17, he moved to Scotland himself, first of all carrying out  agricultural contracts and then building a successful business as a  contractor laying cables and pipes for major utility companies.<br><br>From his first days in Scotland, he became a regular at Celtic Park, developing a deep affinity with the club.<br><br>John  is the most modest of men. Throughout the dramas of the 1990s, he  delivered exactly what was asked of him and what he promised but never  sought the limelight. He was capable of seeing the light and shade of  the saga rather than becoming a partisan. And when the chips were down,  he saved Celtic for us all.<br><br>It is a story which not enough people knew and last year, the Celtic board decided that recognition was long overdue.<br><br>John  accepted an invitation to become Honorary Chairman of the historic  Celtic Football &amp; Athletic Club board which handles relations with  supporters and of which he is a long-standing member. He also agreed to  take part in Saturday&rsquo;s ceremony.<br><br>He looks forward to the event  with a little trepidation: &ldquo;I love the club.

John should forever be regarded as one of  the Club&rsquo;s saviours and, for that reason, all Celtic supporters owe John  an eternal debt.  In the 1990s, an immediate &pound;1million was needed to save Celtic from  the ignominy of administration. To avoid such a catastrophe, John  pledged this amount to the Club. Thanks to John&rsquo;s contribution, trading  was maintained, the wages were paid and administration was averted. The  rest is history.  John then went on to back Fergus McCann&rsquo;s takeover with further  crucial investment. Now, both as supporter and investor, he  enthusiastically endorses the stability and commitment that Dermot  Desmond has brought to the club, making it the force it is today.  A man of true humility and dignity, and a lifelong Celtic  supporter,John played a hugely significant role in preserving the  Club&rsquo;s history, success and, above all, continuity. John played a  pivotal role in saving Celtic for us all.  John has served as a non-executive director of Celtic Football and  Athletic Club for well over 20 years, and his crucial role was  recognised at Celtic&rsquo;s AGM in 2013, when he was confirmed as the  Honorary Chairman of CFAC.  In August 2013, John was given the magnificent and highly deserved  honour of unfurling the League Championship Flag, a moment we know will  always be very dear to John and his family.  John now stands down from the position of Honorary Chairman of CFAC  to enjoy his retirement and in this everyone at the Club wishes him  well.  Celtic Chairman Ian Bankier said: &ldquo;When the Club&rsquo;s very survival was  in doubt, John was there to play a crucial role and he is someone who  should forever be regarded as one of the most important figures in the  Club&rsquo;s history.  &ldquo;I know with John standing down from the Board, our supporters will  take this opportunity to applaud the fantastic contribution of a great  Celtic man and join me in wishing him well on his retirement.  &ldquo;I know, too, that John will continue to support the Club as  passionately as he always did. John will always be a friend of the Club  and we sincerely thank him for all he has done for Celtic.&rdquo;  Dermot Desmond commented:&ldquo;John has been a lifelong, passionate and  steadfast supporter of our great Club. He came to Celtic&rsquo;s rescue in its  hour of need. I wish John well in his retirement and thank him for his  enormous contribution.&rdquo;  Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell said: &ldquo;I would like to thank  John sincerely for all he has given to the Club over such a long period.  He has been a tremendous friend and support to me personally but above  all he is a man who put the Club ahead of anything else.   &quot;He made such a wonderful contribution to Celtic in the 1990s -  ultimately a gesture which saved Celtic &ndash; and ever since has been a  hugely important part of the Club&rsquo;s fabric.  &ldquo;A man always with the best interests of Celtic at heart, across more  than two decades, he has provided invaluable support and counsel to the  Club. As Celtic supporters, we all owe John an enormous debt of  gratitude for everything he has done for the Club, in protecting our  continuity, in preserving our history and ultimately in bringing Celtic  to where it stands today.  &ldquo;We all wish John, Kathleen and the whole family all the very best for the future.&rdquo;  John Keane added: &rdquo;It has been an honour and privilege to be part of  Celtic, a Club I have loved so dearly all my life. I would like to thank  Dermot Desmond, Ian Bankier and Peter Lawwell and all other directors,  past and present, who have worked together and so tirelessly in the best  interests of the Club.  &ldquo;I also wish to pay tribute to all other staff at the Club and, of  course, our supporters who give so much to Celtic and make it the  wonderful institution it is today. I will always be a Celtic supporter  and I wish the Club nothing but continued success for the future.&rdquo; </div><div class="rtearea"></div><div class="rtearea"></div><div class="rtearea">-</div><div class="rtearea"><h3>Fergus McCann&#39;s tribute to John Keane</h3></div><div class="rtearea"> By: Newsroom Staff on 05 Jul, 2019 17:33 FERGUS McCann has paid his own tribute to John Keane, who has retired as Director and Honorary Chairman of Celtic Football and Athletic Club, praising his unwavering commitment to Celtic. Fergus said: &quot;I just saw the news of John Keane&rsquo;s retirement as Honorary Chairman of The Celtic Football and Athletic Company. The Club owes &ndash; and I owe &ndash; John Keane a great debt. He was a major and steadfast partner in the rescue and rebuilding of Celtic. &quot;His commitment never wavered, from long before and during its darkest hour and later, when the hard decisions and hard work had to be done. Unlike some others who promised support then fell away, John was always there. &quot;He avoided the limelight, never claimed credit, and continued to financially support the growth of the Club without seeking personal profit. His special interest was the development of young players &ndash; and that has served Celtic well with years of onfield success. &quot;Like Brother Walfrid, he came from County Sligo in the &#39;Oppressed West&#39; of Ireland. And he left his mark in a different way. Like every true supporter he understood what Celtic means and its importance to so many people &ndash; and was there when it counted.&rdquo;</div><br><br><h3>  &lsquo;Administration was unthinkable. It would have been a slur upon the name of the Club,&rsquo; John Keane</h3>By Editor 6 July, 2019 No Comments<br>https://thecelticstar.com/administration-was-unthinkable-it-would-have-been-a-slur-upon-the-name-of-the-club-john-keane/<br>WILLIE Falconer wasn&rsquo;t a player to particularly make you sit up and take notice. He was alright and pretty indicative of the standard of player that Celtic had filling their squad in March 1994. He was one of many who were average at best, but Willie is a player who nearly became the most infamous Celt in history. That he didn&rsquo;t become that is down quite substantially to a man who retired with a great many platitudes from Celtic and beyond today.<br><br>While the Celtic board was trying to cling on to power as the club slipped from their grasp under a mountain of debt and orchestrated fan boycotts, the board made a play that became one of the most embarrassing and cringe worthy episodes in the history of Celtic.<br><br>Celtic decided they were moving to Cambuslang. No more Paradise.<br><br>David Smith, Patrick Nally and Kevin Kelly of the Celtic board appeared and addressed the assembled press to announce that alongside the secured financial backing from London they had already instructed a company to build Celtic&rsquo;s 3rd stadium.<br><br>The accompanying share issue would see Celtic extend into a bright new dawn. An Emergency General Meeting would see the whole grand plan become a reality. Sadly in was myth. The last desperate hand of a board struggling to come to terms with its own demise.<br><br>It&rsquo;s attempts at smoke and mirrors was uncovered in a few short days by a press who simply contacted the named backers to find though some had been in discussion, none had given any assurances whatsoever. Gefinor and Superstadia who were to be the finance and builders respectively announced in very public statements that absolutely nothing bar an agreement to continue to talk had taken place. The gleeful reporting of the attempted con was nationwide across TV, radio and the printed press.<br><br>With Celtic&rsquo;s finances already precarious the Bank of Scotland didn&rsquo;t take kindly to the attempted hoodwink. They had received an altogether understandable request from Middlesboro to settle the outstanding sum due from the agreed transfer of Willie Falconer. The bank refused to foot the bill.<br><br>The Bank met the Board and despite some disbelief from some who perhaps felt the bank were simply trying some strong arm tactics, the board were left a message in no uncertain terms.<br><br>The Bank of Scotland were going to call in the receivers, they no longer believed Celtic could be run as a going concern. It was rumoured at the time that Celtic were valued at a quarter of that of Partick Thistle.<br><br>Though the long term saving and security of the Club deservedly belongs to Brian Dempsey and ultimately Fergus McCann, it was the action of John Keane that secured its immediate survival.<br><br>Then Chairman Kevin Kelly swallowed his pride and picked up the phone to John Keane after the bank had delivered their chilling message. Legend has it Mr Keane when told of the genuine threat of administration called his own bank manager at The Bank of Ireland in Dublin, authorised the withdrawal of &pound;1million and on Monday Morning that same manager was waiting at opening time at the Bank Of Scotland in Glasgow. He simply deposited that money and Celtic avoided the very real threat of Administration.<br><br>When you consider the factions involved, sides taken, lobbying for influence etc that was going on in the vacuum of the financial implosion there appeared no thought from Mr Keane to think of any political advantage or leverage that he could engineer in return for releasing this huge donation. His immediate thought was that for the saving of his football club. It was &pound;1 million he would in no way have had any confidence whatsoever that he&rsquo;s ever see a penny of again.<br><br>It was as close to an altruistic act as you&rsquo;ll ever see. Can you imagine such a thing happening in this day and age?<br><br>Perhaps someone would come up with the money but it&rsquo;s nigh on impossible to consider it happening without it being offered with many strings attached to advance the individual&rsquo;s wealth, shareholding and influence.<br><br>John Keane bought the club breathing space and nothing more with that act. It bought off the bank temporarily and it purchased the time required to bring factions together and allow the Rebels to purchase enough shares to win the battle.<br><br>Despite this John Keane remained in the background. I could only find one quote attributed to the man himself on the matter.<br><br>&ldquo;Administration was unthinkable. It would have been a slur upon the name of the Club.&rdquo;<br><br>John Keane did that to save the great name of Celtic Football Club being muddied and for no other reason. Wages were not going to be paid, administration was inevitable without a financial shot in the arm. Mr Keane simply arranged for such a significant sum to be paid to protect the dignity and continue the history of Celtic. He&rsquo;d have had no idea whether that would be for 5 weeks, 5 months or forever. He just knew to protect the security and the honour of Celtic he had to do it.<br><br>John Keane didn&rsquo;t finish there. He was already a shareholder at the time of his gifting of the &pound;1 million and he invested further into the Fergus McCann vision for Celtic. All the time staying in the wings, never courting publicity and allowing others to take the limelight and the adulation as the saviours of Celtic.<br><br>In 2012 Mr Keane became Honorary Chairman of the historic Celtic Football &amp; Athletic Club board which handles relations with supporters and of which he was a long-standing member. It is from this role that he resigned from today.<br><br>In 2013 he unfurled the championship flag on the opening day of the season. A fitting honour bestowed upon one of Celtic&rsquo;s greatest men. A moment in the limelight for a man who hid his own light under a bushel.<br><br>His comments when told? Modesty personified.<br><br>&ldquo;I love the club. I have supported it and nothing will change me from that. This is a great honour. I hope I don&rsquo;t trip and that they don&rsquo;t boo me too much!&rdquo;<br><br>Today his own quotes on his retirement have perhaps been lost under a sea of well-wishers and reminisces. As such they&rsquo;re worth repeating.<br><br>&rdquo;It has been an honour and privilege to be part of Celtic, a Club I have loved so dearly all my life. I would like to thank Dermot Desmond, Ian Bankier and Peter Lawwell and all other directors, past and present, who have worked together and so tirelessly in the best interests of the Club.<br><br>&ldquo;I also wish to pay tribute to all other staff at the Club and, of course, our supporters who give so much to Celtic and make it the wonderful institution it is today. I will always be a Celtic supporter and I wish the Club nothing but continued success for the future.&rdquo;<br><br>For me there is a quote from Adam Smith that encapsulates the actions of John Keane.<br><br>&ldquo;How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it, except the pleasure of seeing it.&rdquo;<br><br>That Celtic are as strong as they are today has been a long hard road. Many have invested time energy, money and emotion in growing Celtic from new beginnings in 1994.<br><br>It&rsquo;s difficult to comprehend now, but without John Keane&rsquo;s actions it may well be that Celtic would look altogether different today.<br><br>Thank you Mr Keane. Celtic fans of all ages wish you a long and happy retirement. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll just be glad when the fuss has died down.<br><br>Niall J<br><br>Also on The Celtic Star&hellip;  <br><br><br><br></div></div>
