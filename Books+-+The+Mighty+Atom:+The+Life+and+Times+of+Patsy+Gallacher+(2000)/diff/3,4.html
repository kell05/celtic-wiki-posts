The  author, having researched extensively into Gallacher&#39;s Irish origins,  does not dodge Irish or sectarian issues, which were so alive at the  time that Gallacher played for Celtic. His career is seen against the  backdrop of the First World War and the industrial and social troubles  which affected Glasgow in its immediate aftermath. <br><br>Certain  aspects are dealt with in detail, notably the famous goal in the 1925  Scottish Cup Final. Gallacher&#39;s appearances for Ireland are also  highlighted, as indeed are his years in the dark blue of Falkirk. <br><br>Off  the field, Patsy&#39;s private life is chronicled, in particular the  domestic trauma that hit Gallacher and his family when his wife died  tragically in 1929. his subsequent life as a publican and his own death  are dealt with, as well as an attempt to analyse how good he really was. <br><br>This highly readable book is candid and has the lightness of  touch which has endeared the author to Celtic supporters in his previous  writings about the club. <br><br><div class="emptyClear"> </div>   </div>        <b>About the Author</b>   <div class="productDescriptionWrapper">   David W.

Potter. <br></b>      Patsy Gallacher was in some ways the archetypical Celt. According to  the family tradition, he was born on 16th March 1891 in the Milford Poor  House, County Donegal, Ireland, although his home town was Rathmelton  (more commonly spelt Ramelton to-day) a few miles away. Indeed his birth  certificate gives Ramelton as his place of birth. He was the son of  William and Margaret Gallagher, both illiterate. William&#39;s occupation is  given as a &quot;Post Car Driver&quot; the Victorian equivalent of a taxi driver,  transporting rich people to various parts of rural Donegal. Margaret&#39;s  maiden name had also been Gallagher. Gallagher was a very common name in  County Donegal - and still is.<br><br>More precise indications of the  family&#39;s whereabouts and circumstances will be hard to come by, for the  1891Census returns were destroyed in the Civil War in 1922 as Dublin  Castle fell victim to the fratricidal struggle of whether the Dail  should accept the Treaty offered by the British in 1921 and become the  Irish Free State or hold out for a Republic. It is believed in the  family, however, that William hailed from a farm called Slamanahan, and  Margaret from a farm called Goland. <br><br>Donegal is of course the  part of Ireland most associated with the immigrations to Scotland in the  19th Century, and if there were one part of Ireland that the most  pedantic of Celtic historians were asked to give as the exact roots of  Celtic Football Club, he would no doubt say &quot;County Donegal&quot;. A visit to  the Ramelton district of County Donegal will reveal lovely,  warm-hearted people and an area of Ireland alive with the history of  that troubled land. <br><br>The famous Red Hugh O&#39;Donnell, who gave the  Saxons all sorts of trouble in the late 1590&#39;s, was based around Lough  Swilly, and it was from Rathmullan a few kilometres up the side of the  Lough that Hugh&#39;s brother Rory and another Hugh  - O&#39;Neill - departed  the Irish scene in 1607. This &quot;Flight of the Earls&quot; left the way open  for the British Government to &quot;plant&quot; Protestant settlers in Ireland and  sow the seeds of the trouble that befouls Ireland today. Rathmullan  remained strategically very important for the British, providing  anchorage for the Atlantic Fleet of the Royal Navy in World War One. <br><br>Ramelton  indeed is a &quot;plantation&quot; town and was for a time very prosperous at the  head of Lough Swilly. The railway, however, came to nearby Letterkenny  rather than Ramelton in the latter part of the 19th century, and  Ramelton declined in status. Yet it survived and to-day&#39;s Ramelton will  show a small town sharing in the general prosperity that has come the  way of Ireland since their entry into the European Union in 1973. The  quay was used as the set for the film &quot;The Hanging Gale&quot;, which deals  with the Famine of 1845-7. <br><br>Inhabitants are friendly and  hospitable with a long tradition of religious tolerance. The descendants  of the &quot;plantation&quot; Scots, who hailed mainly from Ayrshire bringing  with them their Presbyterian way of life get on well with the indigenous  Catholics. They are indeed all Irish. In footballing terms, there is a  tendency to support Manchester United or Celtic with words being said in  favour of Finn Harps in the League of Ireland and the local junior team  Swilly Rovers. Patsy Gallagher is by now a nebulous figure. Other than  an acknowledgement that he was a famous footballer who played for Celtic  and once scored a goal with the ball wedged between his feet, the  people of Ramelton know little about their most famous son. <br><br>The  19th century began badly for Donegal and finished worse. Wolfe Tone of  the United Irishmen had tried to organize a French invasion in the last  few years of the 18th century, but was betrayed and arrested in Buncrana  on the other side of Lough Swilly from Ramelton. The Famine of the  1840&#39;s hit the area hard, as a visit to the Heritage Centre at nearby  Dunfanaghy will indicate. Exploitation of the Irish by the absentee  British landlords and their brutal bailiffs was as prevalent in Donegal  as it was in other parts of the country.  By 1891, things had perhaps  stabilised and the situation was quiet. It would be hard to claim  however that Donegal was happy or content. <br><br>William Gallagher&#39;s  job as a Post Car Driver in 1891 was not a bad one, better than quite a  few people at the time. But Donegal was still a desperately poor place  with the perpetual threat of another Famine. Accordingly, a few years  after the birth of Patrick Gallagher, his illiterate parents decided to  try their luck in Scotland. Quite a lot of people were doing the same  and Clydebank seemed a fair bet, for it was the hub of the shipbuilding  industry - and there was no sign of any recession in that industry.  Ships would always be required for the mighty British Empire. They were  hardly the first or the last to do so, with Clydebank in particular  seeming to hold a particular attraction for the people of Donegal. The  Gallaghers would not exactly be among total strangers in their new home -  nor would there be any lack of people called Gallagher! <br><br>By the  time that William and Margaret decided to move on to Scotland, they had a  family of seven - four boys, Johnnie, Willie, Jimmy and Patrick and  three girls called Madge, Mary and Maggie. This was probably some time  about the turn of the century, but it is difficult to put an accurate  date on it. <br><br>Immigrations from Donegal to Scotland (and the  U.S.A., Canada and Australia) had of course been going on for some  considerable time before the Gallaghers decided to move. The exodus had  begun with the repression which followed the unsuccessful rebellion of  1797 and 1798. There had been a steady trickle of immigrants throughout  the 1820&#39;s and 1830&#39;s, but the real catalyst was the Potato Famine of  1845 and 1846. <br><br>Other historians will deal at length with the  Potato Blight and its effects. It was possibly the single most important  event in Irish history, far more significant than the Battle of the  Boyne or the Easter Rising, more influential than Parnell or Connolly,  and affecting the world in a way that no one could have foreseen on that  bright spring morning in 1845 when someone noticed a few white spots on  a potato leaf. One statistic is horrific, and that is the decline of  the population of Ireland from around 10 million to 3 million in less  than a century.      <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Review</h3><span class="diffRemove">[...]</span><i><span class="diffAdd">(from Not The View)</span></i><br><span class="diffAdd">  My father was not old enough to have seen him play but I remember in the late 60s when I was a 7 or 8, dad passing on stories of Gallacher&#39;s brilliance that had been told to him by people who had seen him play. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I knew that Delaney (who my dad did see), McGrory, Napier, Thomson and the post-war greats were superb players, but it was Patsy Gallacher I wish I had seen play.

But like most people the most I knew was that his grandson was a terrific player with Dundee United whose career had never quite lived up to its potential. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The problem after reading this book is that I&#39;m not sure I know him that much better. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In many respects this is a terrific read in the style of other books by this author and Campbell &amp; Woods, mixing as it does the Celtic of Patsy&#39;s career, some fascinating social titbits of the time as well as placing it all in a wider social/ historical context. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The author is not shy in giving his opinion - which is fine - and the writing does have some fine quirky touches (although he rather overdoes the exclamation marks to emphasise a point). But the real problem for me is that, particularly in the early chapters, there&#39;s not enough about Patsy Gallacher. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I have a feeling that Potter - who I would guess is in his mid to late 50s and perhaps has a father who saw the great man play - assumes that his readers are as familiar with Patsy&#39;s style of play as the writer himself obviously is and that Gallacher is as widely known by Celtic fans as Potter thinks he is. But I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s true. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I, for one, would have appreciated a few more passages describing his playing style and the reasons for the excitement it clearly generated (as Campbell and Woods managed). </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Those Celtic fans that know of Patsy would almost certainly acknowledge that he was the best player Celtic had fielded until the 1960s, but I wonder if he&#39;s as instantly recognisable to contemporary fans as McGrory or John Thomson. He should be. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">On a personal basis I can&#39;t agree unequivocally with Potter&#39;s belief that Gallacher was Celtic&#39;s best player of all time. It may be the case that the standard of Scottish league football was higher in Patsy&#39;s time than it was during the period of 9-in-a-row, but I would think it highly unlikely that any Scottish club side which played between 1911 and 1932 was as good as the best teams Celtic defeated in European competition during Jock Stein&#39;s time. Johnstone, Murdoch, Gemmell and company succeeded at a level Patsy never did (or could). But that was not his fault, and given what is told and known of his style of play, as well as his professionalism with regard to fitness (which seems to have been far ahead of his contemporaries) only a fool would say that he wouldn&#39;t have made it in the modern era. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">To be fair to David Potter there can&#39;t be too many people still alive who saw Patsy play in the flesh or who knew him well enough to provide the author with fresh insights. Newspaper reporting of the time seems to have been no better than it is now. The author himself acknowledges that there is very little in the way of a visual record either - the photographs in the book are often posed team pictures rather than action shots - and no newsreel footage exists at all. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Still, this is a worthy effort to fill a gap in Celtic books and the chapter on his time at Falkirk is terrific. Best of all, Potter&#39;s enthusiasm for his subject makes you believe that a small, thin, almost unhealthy-looking man from a background of desperate poverty became, for a time, quite simply the best footballer in the world. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And there can&#39;t be many people you can say that about.  </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Product Details</h3><b>Paperback:</b> 200 pages<br><b>Publisher:</b> Parrs Wood Press (1 Oct 2000)<br><b>Language</b> English<br><b>ISBN-10:</b> 1903158109<br><b>ISBN-13:</b> 978-1903158104<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>     <h3>Links</h3><ul><li>[...]</li></ul></div>
