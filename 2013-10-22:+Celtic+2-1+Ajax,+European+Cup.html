Not as good a performance as our first two outings this year, but who cares?!<br><br>Credit all around. Forster was immense and everyone else did their job.<br><br>While  the back 4 did fine, I didn&#39;t feel they were as immense as some are  making them out to be. Did their jobs, but this wasn&#39;t Messi/Balotelli  they were up against. In a match where everyone did what they were  supposed to do but no one truly shined (other than Forster), for me two  key moments from two of our key players stood out and changed the game  (and are worthy of a bit more praise than they&#39;ve been given):<br><br>Stokes&#39;  control, touch, balance and nous to win the penalty was brilliant. He&#39;s  exactly who we would want on the ball in that situation and he  delivered. I doubt many, if any, of our other options would have come  through as such there---they would have made a different choice, not had  the right weight on the touch that took them past the defender,  oversold the contact or something else that would have prevented the  award. Stokes did everything perfectly and won the enormously important  penalty. So many folks seem to prefer a &#39;striker&#39; who can win useless  headers, clatter through defenders or &#39;hold the ball up&#39; --- I&#39;ll take the guy who creates goals, thanks <br><br>Sammy&#39;s  thinking in setting up the second was even better. 90% of players would  have immediately drilled the cross in left-footed after beating the  rb---it would&#39;ve been a wasted, off-footed cross, however, as we had one  attacker in the box v. 3+ defenders. His decision to slow down, shift  behind the ball, look up and cut back inside, however, allowed our  on-rushing attackers to flood the box, and even though his shot was  blocked, the result was the ball spinning out to an unmarked Kayal in  dangerous shooting territory. <br><br>In a game where each side was  pretty much able to nullify the other (or perhaps more accurately  neither side had the talent to overcome the other&#39;s  nullifying/defending), it was these two moments (along with Forster&#39;s  brilliance and Kayal&#39;s fantastic last man tackle mid-first half) that,  for me, stood out.<br><br>All credit to the entire 11, but especially  these two (and the impenetrable FF) for the moments that really  changed/decided the game. <br><br><i>(Anton Rogans Right boot of KDS forum)</i><br>Ajax fans were a disgrace to their club. And the police? The GB can get  huckled for jumping sideyways, yet they let one absolute roaster spend  almost the entire game on the shoulders of another eejit with his back  to the game! The Ajax fans were throwing chairs, glasses, cups, coins,  whatever they could get at the police and into 117 - we were in 417 in  the front row, could see right into them.<br><br>There was one walloper that spent the whole second half with a Sevco scarf miming playing the flute!<br><br>Police  non-reaction was disgusting too - they seemed to let the stewards do  it. I did see one female cop almost push a Celtic fan down the staris as  he was making a &quot;winker&quot; sign to the clowns in the Ajax support.<br><br>Is  it worth complaining to the club and the police about this? My son has a  lot of issues about noise and stuff like that, he was all over the  shop, spent most of the second half staring at them in case they started  again :/ 						 						 						 					<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><h3>  Celtic  </h3><ul><li class="MsoNormal">01 Forster </li><li class="MsoNormal">23 Lustig (Biton - 77&#39;

Apart from the loss of Victor Wanyama and Gary Hooper in the summer sales, Celtic had to contend with the enforced absences of their captain, Scott Brown, Adam Matthews and Kris Commons for the visit of Ajax, with a win vital after two defeats without scoring.<br><br>But goals from James Forrest and Beram Kayal secured a deserved victory and not even the late sending off of Nir Biton or Lasse Sch&ouml;ne&#39;s consolation goal for Ajax could temper Celtic&#39;s delight.<br><br>&quot;We are in an excellent position now, where qualification is not beyond us,&quot; Lennon said. &quot;This was a massive win in the context of the group. It was a heroic effort.&quot;<br><br>Frank de Boer, Lennon&#39;s Ajax counterpart, was hardly gracious. &quot;Celtic did not create anything but scored two goals,&quot; he said. &quot;We dominated the game.&quot;<br><br>De Boer&#39;s focus would be better placed on Stefano Denswil, whose foul on Anthony Stokes handed Celtic a penalty from which they took the lead.<br><br>The frantic early exchanges resembled a knock-out tie. Celtic enjoyed more possession but Ajax attacked with pace. Fraser Forster almost helped the visitors&#39; cause when he spilled a routine cross but the Celtic goalkeeper recovered to kick clear.<br><br>Celtic immediately created a glorious chance. Mikael Lustig&#39;s low cross should have been knocked home by Teemu Pukki, but the Finland international striker failed to connect with the ball, displaying the kind of profligacy that had been undermining Celtic&#39;s Champions League campaign.<br><br>Instead of taking the lead Celtic almost went behind on the half hour, after they failed to properly clear a Viktor Fischer free-kick. But when the ball dropped to Christian Poulsen at the back post his effort rebounded off Forster&#39;s right-hand post.<br><br>At this stage, Ajax were increasingly dominant but when Celtic&#39;s breakthrough arrived, it resulted from Denswil&#39;s ill-judged challenge on Stokes just inside the penalty area when the forward was not causing any particular trouble. Forrest, hitherto Celtic&#39;s best performer, stepped up to stroke home an excellent penalty.<br><br>Half-time had been notable for a clash between a section of Ajax fans and police. A steward was hit by a seat apparently thrown from the visiting area, although the fracas was contained swiftly. A stronger than normal security presence had been apparent in Glasgow before the match.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s second-half task was to protect their lead and Lennon would have stressed that at the interval. Seven minutes after the re-start, Forster once again proved his team&#39;s saviour, the England squad player making a fine save when Thulani Serero was sent clean through on goal.<br><br>It was rendered even more valuable within a minute when Kayal&#39;s 20-yard shot was deflected into the Ajax net off Denswil. Few would have grudged Celtic their first piece of good fortune in this season&#39;s competition, with the build-up work of Georgios Samaras worthy of credit.<br><br>Ajax responded with Kolbeinn Sigthorsson shooting narrowly wide and Serero, who had provided Ajax&#39;s most potent threat, driving over with 12 minutes left.<br><br>If that was Celtic&#39;s last real moment of panic, they were to end the night with 10 men and having conceded a goal. Biton, who had replaced Lustig, lunged into Serero and was shown a straight red card. &quot;I have no complaints,&quot; said Lennon.<br><br>Sch&ouml;ne, also a substitute, then curled a shot past Forster from 20 yards. It was a fine goal but irrelevant to the result.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>By Alasdair Lamont BBC Scotland&#39;s senior football reporter at Celtic Park<br><br>Celtic recorded a crucial and highly deserved first win of the Champions League group stage to move above Ajax.<br><br>A finely balanced first half ended with James Forrest showing great composure to score from the penalty spot.<br><br>Beram Kayal got what proved to be the winner with a deflected shot in a second half controlled by the hosts.<br><br>There was a late wobble from Neil Lennon&#39;s side after substitute Nir Biton was sent off and Lasse Schone fired in an injury-time goal.<br><br>But Schone&#39;s impressive drive was virtually the last kick of the ball and Celtic got the victory that keeps them well in contention for a place in the last 16 for a second successive season.<br>Play media<br><br>Interview - Celtic manager Neil Lennon<br><br>They now head to Amsterdam in a fortnight&#39;s time in third place and surely full of confidence they can take something from that game, especially having won this one without the influential trio of Scott Brown, Kris Commons and Adam Matthews.<br><br>Perhaps the match&#39;s pivotal moment came in the closing moments of the first half.<br><br>Anthony Stokes, a hitherto unseen presence on the night, was brought crashing to the deck by a clumsy Stefano Denswil challenge, giving the referee an easy decision.<br><br>Following a lengthy delay, Forrest swept the resultant penalty confidently past Jasper Cillessen.<br><br>If that was the ideal way to end the half, there was an early and decisive breakthrough in the second period.<br><br>Georgios Samaras&#39;s ball into the box from the left was cleared as far as Kayal, whose placed effort from 20 yards deflected off the unfortunate Denswil to beat Cillessen.<br><br>Ajax may have wondered at that stage quite how they found themselves two goals down and yet had they been more clinical either just before or just after that Kayal goal, their predicament would not have been as dire.<br>Beram Kayal scores for Celtic against Ajax<br><br>Kayal&#39;s shot took a deflection en route to goal<br><br>Thulani Serero and Kolbeinn Sigthorsson carved out a glorious chance only for Serero to shoot tamely at Fraser Forster.<br><br>And Sigthorsson himself should have done better than to shoot narrowly wide with only the keeper to beat.<br><br>When they did eventually get past Forster, it was with just seconds remaining - Schone&#39;s powerful swerving effort from just outside the box a fine effort nonetheless.<br><br>In truth, Ajax might have found themselves in front long before Forrest&#39;s strike, as Christian Poulsen volleyed against the post from a Viktor Fischer free-kick.<br><br>But Celtic had also been wasteful in the early stages, with Teemu Pukki failing to connect with a perfect Mikael Lustig cross, which was begging to be converted.<br><br>Other than the late goal, Forster&#39;s only other tests in the second half came from distance, with Schone having another effort pushed away and Daley Blind also going close.<br><br>But given the way they controlled the second half, anything other than a Celtic win would have felt unjust, though there was nothing unjust about Biton&#39;s red card - Celtic&#39;s second in two Champions League games following Scott Brown&#39;s dismissal against Barcelona - as the Israeli slid in dangerously on Serero.<br><br>The game was also marred somewhat by crowd trouble among the visiting support following Celtic&#39;s opening goal, but nothing could take away from another fine Champions League achievement by Celtic.<br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 2, Ajax 1.<br>90:00 +4:22 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 2, Ajax 1.<br>90:00 +3:31 Goal scored<br><br>Goal!
