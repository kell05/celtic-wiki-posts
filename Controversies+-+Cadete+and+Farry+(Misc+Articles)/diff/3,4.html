Funny, sarcastic, unperturbed and  slightly smart-arse; all couched in the language of a legal document  requiring five rubber stamps and a monarch&#39;s signature. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Farry is  a man who has probably never said &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in his life. There  would be provisos, sub-clauses, riders, bluffs and all kinds of strings  attached. He was, after all, bred up to this job, joining the SFA in  1972 as a fresh-faced office boy of 18. &quot;I was the boy sharpening the  pencils and making the tea. We still have pencils and I still sharpen my  own, I may add.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">He dug ditches before that. But he&#39;s grown up. Now he mans the machine guns. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">He  is powerful in the sport and clearly loves it. His bald head positively  glows with self-esteem and the twinkle rarely leaves his sexy eyes. (He  is only 42 but going on 123, the age of the Association to which he is  umbilically attached.) He is, perhaps, one of the most enormously  likeable old flatulents in sport and this from a visitor who was kept in  the freezing cold on the SFA doorstep because it was a few minutes  before 9:30 -opening time - when I arrived. That&#39;s typical too. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;We  must be alert to protect the game from potential abuse,&quot; he said at one  point. How? &quot;By our regulations, by our articles, by our membership  being vigilant,&quot; he replied and you could almost see the red tape  holding up his trousers. But he is more than the sum of jumped-up car  park attendants. He might even rule, as Boutros Boutros Ghali was said  to have run the UN: &quot;by stealth and sudden violence&quot;. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">But he is  not a brute. Far from it. &quot;Good morning, Glenda. Tea for two please,&quot;  were his first words into an intercom as we settled into his oceanic  office. Then he moved smoothly into highly-charged, unrepentant  controversy. </span><br><br><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;We want football to be protected from the  entrepreneurs.&quot; Protected? &quot;In England,&quot; I said, &quot;football has never  been run with such entrepreneurial spirit, and yet you could argue it  had never been richer.&quot; </span></b><br><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> </span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;You could argue that,&quot; he  replied, &quot;but with it have come many problems.&quot; Like what? &quot;Crime.&quot; It  was the only time in the interview - possibly in his life - that he had  used a one-word response to a question. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;You know what I&#39;m  referring to. Many, many stated cases - some still the subject of court  action - but there&#39;s been a fairly widespread and regrettable  highlighting of some of the unfortunate aspects of this encouragement of  entrepreneurialism,&quot; he said, in fine Circumlocution Office manner. But  I can offer a translation: George Graham&#39;s bung, Marseilles&#39; alleged  11m in bribes, Bruce Grobbelaar in court. &quot;I couldn&#39;t possibly comment,&quot;  said Farry. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;The game of football is a sport and when you  introduce the aspect of business, paying dividends to shareholders and  city investors, then they&#39;re not too interested in the ethos of our  sport. They&#39;re interested in the bottom line. How the bottom line is  achieved is regulated by the Companies&#39; Act not by any sporting ethos.&quot; </span></b><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">He  is supported in his view by the rumour that Sir John Hall at Newcastle  is considering a pull-out to recoup, indeed improve upon, his outlay.  &quot;Well, we have a club&#39;s managing director who&#39;s stated the same,&quot; said  Farry. &quot;Celtic</span><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&#39;s</span></b><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> managing director... </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;...Come in. Thank-you, Ann Marie. Do you take milk in your tea?&quot; he said, elegantly being mother. </span><br><br><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;I  fear that at the present time there is an over-concentration on the  bottom line rather than considering the attractiveness of our sport, the  maintenance of its development and the needs of others. In this  lemming-like rush for financial goodies others have been trampled along  the way.&quot; </span></b><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">I took that to mean Rangers and Celtic don&#39;t put enough back. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;Well,  if you&#39;re Boots the Chemist, your mission in life is not to go along to  your rivals and say: &#39;How may we help you?&#39; Now football doesn&#39;t have  that, because you need opposition, so I support those endeavours of any  clubs who genuinely want to support the maintenance of professional  football by making sacrifices from their own income to ensure the  challengers are better equipped to challenge. </span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;But that&#39;s maybe a wee bit wishful thinking,&quot; he conceded with a hearty laugh. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">If  you are talking sacrifice, the powers of Rangers and Celtic might  prefer to offer Farry up to the great god Mammon if he goes on like  this. He should surely be more worried that they might simply push off  to a European Superleague soon. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;Well, if any member club were  to take the view that their legitimate aspirations cannot be met from  within the existing structure, then they would not pay their  subscription fee for the next season. But you&#39;ve got to be sure of where  you&#39;re going. Sometimes it is more financially worthwhile to be the big  fish in the wee pool rather than the wee fish in the big pool.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">This  veiled threat surely ignores the mortal blow to Scottish football were  the big two to leave. &quot;Only if they&#39;re playing Scottish players,&quot;  retorted Farry. &quot;If they&#39;re just a multinational side with no Scottish  identity they could hardly claim to represent Scotland.&quot; I mused it  seemed to be going that way with more Scandinavians on a working-holiday  in Britain than generally clog the beaches of the Costa del Sol. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;I  think it is that way,&quot; said Farry. He is what the Tories would call -  and whip - a Euro-sceptic. I hesitate to paraphrase a man who chooses  words with the fastidiousness of a wine-buff picking a bottle in  Oddbins, but his gist was that the whole European ideal was alien to  sport. In politics the trend is towards homogeny. Sport, on the other  hand, must guard its national identity. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">It was a beautiful  concept, utterly at odds with reality. But his shining forehead showed  no signs of banging against brickwork. &quot;I&#39;m fairly philosophical,  pragmatic,&quot; he said, as indeed he must be to repel the vitriolic  personal attacks frequently heaped on his person. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;Well, I am not a fragile flower but, yes, some of the petals have been pinched. Of course you&#39;re not made of stone.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">That  was not what they thought on the touchline when the schoolboy Farry  played full-back, giving an apparent impersonation of a concrete block.  &quot;I was pretty ropey, I&#39;d say,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But I quickly realised  having a reasonably numerate mind that you stood a better chance of  getting a game if there were 15 in the team than if there were 11. So  being a fairly unexciting full-back or centre-half, I soon converted to  being a more glamorous wing-half at rugby.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">As a Third Lanark  supporter, he would watch football of a higher quality than he played,  but his parents would not allow him to go to the bigger clubs. His dad  was a policeman and so it must have been in the genes. He is, after all,  policing football. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;Shall we say, more, the procurator fiscal,&quot;  he said, hugely entertained. &quot;Reports get referred to me. I tend not to  arrest them. Sometime I wouldn&#39;t mind that power, right enough, but so  far they ain&#39;t giving me it.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">For a heavy-set man he dances  through a conversation like Fred Astaire. You wonder that the image of  the SFA has not been thoroughly lightened by his presence. But, of  course, I was forgetting. &quot;We are governed by our articles, our rules,  our regulations. I don&#39;t make them, the clubs make them. They&#39;re the  ones who telephone me on a Monday morning and say: &#39;Did you see what he  said! He can&#39;t get away with it! What are you going to do about it?&#39; &quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;Just say: &#39;Where&#39;s your sense of humour?&#39; and put the phone down,&quot; I offered. </span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;Well,  amazingly, the clubs wouldn&#39;t like that. My job - I&#39;m the Fiscal - is  to put it to the test. If there is a case to answer, the appropriate  sub-committee will deal with the matter.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Ah! the sub-committee.  Farry&#39;s spiritual home where, you suspect, he tells them all what to  think and then they reach his concensus. Not that his views aren&#39;t  cogent. He is frankly dismissive of Celtic&#39;s suspicion that they may be  victims of some Masonic conspiracy amongst referees. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;It&#39;s  sometimes an asset for management - and it might also massage the shares  value - to blame others for your own inadequacies. You know, it&#39;s just  an unfortunate part of life in Scotland, particularly in the west of  Scotland, that you really are aware of innuendo and aspersions and  unsubstantiated allegations which are borne out of nothing to do with  fact, but are akin to &#39;did you hear Mrs McGuffie&#39;s hingin&#39; oot her  washing on a Sunday. Isn&#39;t that terrible?&#39; I mean we&#39;re dealing with  gossip.&quot; He said the word with profound contempt. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Farry has more  high-minded matters to consider: the whole tenuous, sometimes bitter,  always chaotic, business of Scottish football. &quot;I am the fulcrum on  which the system operates.

From the evidence  presented yesterday, it is difficult not to conclude that this is a game  in which collective inefficiency, negligence and hypocrisy have played a  blinder.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> If Farry, the SFA&#39;s discredited chief executive, was  guilty of deliberately and damagingly delaying the registration of Jorge  Cadete when the player joined Celtic from Sporting Lisbon in 1996, the  behaviour of the association&#39;s office bearers and executive committee  members is unlikely to stand much scrutiny. It is now known that Fergus  McCann began agitating over the Cadete registration procedure at the end  of the first week in March 1996. The Celtic managing</span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> director  having made his discontent known, the executive committee did not decide  until the 29th of the month to approve the player&#39;s registration.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  When asked yesterday about the part played by the office bearers and  the executive, McCann questioned whether &quot;they had received all the  relevant information&quot;, a clear implication that Farry had deliberately  kept details from his masters. Even if this was the case, the  responsibility of ensuring that there was no wrongdoing lay with the  officials. At the very least, the office bearers, John McBeth, of Clyde;  Chris Robinson of Hearts (both vice-presidents) and George Peat of  Airdrie (treasurer), should have insisted on examining all pertinent  material and accelerating the process.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> Their lack of action is  at least the equal of Farry&#39;s, even if the chief executive, as the man  in charge of administration, was the starting-point for the improper  handling of the matter. The fourth office bearer, president Jack McGinn,  is exempt from indictment because, as an interested party - he is  Celtic&#39;s representative -he was not permitted to take any part in the  case.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> But McCann, having at first appeared to have excused the  officials, later referred to his general dissatisfaction, with the  observation: </span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> &quot;Are the right people making the decisions on Scottish  football? Is there manipulation? Could the decision-making process be  better handled? We know the bureaucracy could be reduced.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> These  utterances all hint at culpability on the part of those who make the  executive decisions. Farry is not empowered to do so and, even if the  Cadete business began purely as an administrative issue, it became a  matter for the executive committee when McCann began making dissenting  noises.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> It is hugely significant that these officials took the  advice of counsel last week and agreed to capitulate in the face of  McCann&#39;s onslaught. This evasive action precluded the opportunity for  John Murray QC to deliver a written judgment. There is little doubt that  the arbiter would have left those who run Scottish football&#39;s governing  body without a name.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> The former Lord Dervaird, for example,  would surely have questioned how internal inquiries into the business at  Park Gardens could possibly have exonerated Farry on a previous  occasion when the case presented by Celtic proved to be unopposable.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  This would unquestionably have brought a recommendation that the least  the SFA could do in future would be to have such matters settled quickly  by an independent tribunal such as the one Murray himself had  conducted. More than that, he would almost inevitably have condemned as  an unfair practice the SFA regulation which forbids its members from  seeking satisfaction through the judicial process.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> This is an  anachronistic rule which would not stand up in any court and one which  has caused McCann most annoyance throughout this inordinately and  unnecessarily lengthy search for an admission of wrongdoing, an apology,  a reimbursement of Cadete&#39;s wages for two weeks and, ultimately, the  sacking of Farry.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> McCann was so enraged by the three years it  has taken and by Farry&#39;s obstinacy, that he expanded his original  demands to embrace the chief executive&#39;s removal.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> This was not  one of his original objectives. The longer the executive dithered over  their own nonsensical &quot;internal inquiries&quot;, the more insistent and the  more vindictive the Celtic chairman became.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> The office bearers&#39;  hypocrisy is seen in their rush to take disciplinary action against  Farry in the form of suspension. This is an employee who was cleared of  any offence by their own investigation. Given the sequence of events  outlined by Celtic yesterday, how could they possibly have made a proper  examination of what is, as McCann said: &quot;an open and shut case&quot;, and  arrived at exoneration of their man?</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> And, having done so, it is  hypocritical in the extreme to be contemplating his dismissal, the  normal corollary to suspension. Their folly could now cost them a  substantial amount of money, with a 1million pay-off not out of the  question. Farry&#39;s refusal to resign is the least shocking aspect of the  entire business.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> He knows perfectly well that employers can  hardly fire him for gross negligence when they themselves have already  declared him innocent. Well, not without handsome compensation.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  Since his salary runs to six figures and he is only 44 - some 21 years  short of retirement age - his settlement negotiations could cause some  panic in the executive breast.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> This is not to say, of course,  that Farry should be retained. There has been a series of  miscalculations by the chief executive, including the Duncan Ferguson  case, which have caused severe embarrassment and his position does now  seem irretrievable.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> But, on the question of poor judgment and the abuse of power, he is not alone.</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Football: Celtic win Farry fight</span></h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">David McKinney   </span><br><font size="1"><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Tuesday, 2 March 1999</span></font><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> </span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">(Independent)</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">JIM  FARRY&#39;S football career is effectively at an end after the Scottish  Football Association chief executive was yesterday suspended over the  Jorge Cadete affair. Celtic have claimed for three years that Farry  delayed the processing of the transfer of the Portuguese player in time  for the Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers in 1996. Celtic lost the  game 2-1, but yesterday they won the war against the most powerful  figure in the Scottish game. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The SFA has offered Celtic a  written apology as well as agreeing to pay compensation and meet  Celtic&#39;s legal fees, and Fergus McCann, the Celtic chief executive,  yesterday wasted little time in condemning the part played by Farry. &quot;It  has taken Celtic and its supporters three years to receive justice on  the issue of the SFA&#39;s chief executive Jim Farry&#39;s failure to properly  register Jorge Cadete.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;It is deplorable that a prominent member  club should be disadvantaged in this way when on several occasions the  SFA&#39;s chief executive had the opportunity to make the correct decision.  Mr Farry&#39;s failure to properly and timeously register Jorge Cadete  leaves the club in no other position than to ask for the office bearers  of the SFA to recognise that Mr Farry&#39;s position is untenable. This case  demonstrates clearly that Mr Farry cannot be allowed to hold and  exercise such powerful authority.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The issue recently went to  arbitration with the SFA admitting liability before proceedings could  finish. Clearly angered by the whole situation, Celtic are demanding the  dismissal of Farry, who has held the top job at the SFA since 1990  following 10 years as secretary of the Scottish League.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">In the  last nine years he has been frequently criticised for his dictatorial  attitude which at times appeared out of tune with the ordinary  supporter. He insisted on Scotland playing a European Championship  qualifier on the day of the funeral of Princess Diana only to back down  in the face of severe pressure and criticism.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Farry&#39;s motives for  delaying the Cadete transfer remain unclear and although Celtic  supporters will interpret his actions as indicating a pro-Rangers stance  McCann refused to be drawn on the topic. &quot;I&#39;m not claiming there was  malice but there was intent. There was a failure on his part despite the  advice of Fifa and Celtic. This is a matter that goes beyond Celtic  Football Club, it&#39;s a question of somebody who has failed to follow the  rules of football.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">McCann intends to hold discussions with the  other clubs in the Scottish Premier League and his frustration with the  powerbrokers at the SFA could prove the motive towards a shift of power  towards the new body who would effectively run the elite body of  Scottish football. In the meantime Farry has agreed to co-operate with  an SFA investigation into his actions.</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  </span><tbody><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  </span><tr><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">SFA boss suspended</span></h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> </span><font size="1"><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Monday, March 1, 1999 Published at 18:53 GMT</span></font><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> </span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">(BBC)</span><br><img alt="Controversies - Cadete and Farry - Kerrydale Street" height="5" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/_JT7DD7YqPkJ28djCgmH_w43/GW1H5" title="Controversies - Cadete and Farry - Kerrydale Street" width="1"><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The  Scottish Football Association has suspended its Chief Executive, Jim  Farry, in a row over the transfer of a Celtic player three years ago. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Mr  Farry had vowed to carry on but the suspension was announced on Monday.

But the embattled  chief  executive, a punctilious  power-broker of fearsome repute,  probably  wouldn&#39;t have recognised it.  In a supreme irony, it was the Great  Administrator&#39;s misadministration  that proved to be his downfall.</span></div><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">                       His   misinterpretation of what was written in the game&#39;s statutes forced him   to face Celtic&#39;s lawyers in an arbitration case and ultimately forced   him out of office in what will be remembered as Scottish football&#39;s   greatest courtroom drama.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Ten years ago this week the Royal  Automobile Club in  Glasgow    provided the setting for the endgame in  an extraordinary  saga. Its starting point had come three years earlier  when the SFA   fatally delayed   registering the new Celtic signing,  Jorge Cadete.  Farry&#39;s stubborn refusal to lodge the paperwork in time  for the  Portuguese striker to appear in the 1996 Scottish Cup  semi-final, and  Celtic owner Fergus McCann&#39;s equally stubborn refusal  to let the matter  rest, have given rise to various theories on the  motives of two abrasive  men. Previously unreleased legal papers shown  to Scotland on Sunday do  not lend any credence to the fanciful  interpretations which have taken  root  in the decade since. Nothing  supports the notion that Farry acted  deliberately to hold up Cadete&#39;s  registration out of &quot;anti-Celtic&quot; bias.  Or that his adversary, McCann,  was responsible for a  &quot;witch-hunt&quot;. Yet  so sensitive does the episode  remain that McCann declined to discuss it   this week. Neither was Farry  available for comment.  </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Farry  left the arbitration hearing at  the RAC  on February 24, 1996 with no  future in a game   he had served  across three decades  because his own  testimony destroyed his  reputation. Even the SFA&#39;s own lawyers, Burness  Solicitors, picked  Farry apart. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The case revolved around the  wording of an  International Transfer Certificate for Cadete, who joined    Celtic from  Sporting CP (Lisbon). Celtic forwarded the ITC to the SFA  on March 7,  1996 with all other relevant paperwork having arrived two  weeks  earlier. Initially, the club  believed the player was a free  agent. He  wasn&#39;t, but that should have had no bearing on  Farry  registering  Cadete. Celtic could not convince him of this because of a   &quot;conditionality clause&quot; within the ITC. Under law, this was an   irrelevance, which a fax from FIFA explained. Yet, it was not until   Celtic lodged a third application to register Cadete at the end of March   that Farry was eventually persuaded of that fact. Under the SFA&#39;s   14-day clearance rule, that was too late for the striker to play in the   Scottish Cup semi-final against Rangers on April 6 &ndash; a match Celtic  lost  2-1. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">On March 29, Farry agreed to apply it retrospectively, only to change his mind the following day.  </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The   Burness report exposed the extent of Farry&#39;s bungling. At the   arbitration hearing he &quot;substantially damaged his credibility and the   integrity of the Association&#39;s case&quot; by failing to produce   correspondence from FIFA between 1994 and 1996 on the conditionality of   ITCs. He &quot;drew a warning&quot; for &quot;consistently&quot; evading questions; was   &quot;unable to give a convincing explanation&quot; why conditions in the second   application &quot;were unacceptable to him&quot;; &quot;indicated significant   aspects...of registration fell to subordinates&quot; &quot;as he had been abroad&quot;;   &quot;he gave evidence ... not regarded as credible ....&quot;; &quot;he gave   contradictory evidence on the powers of the Executive Committee&quot;; &quot;was   unable to explain why retrospectivity of the ITC was not applied in this   case&quot; and &quot;deflected responsibility to Mr (Sandy] Bryson (head of   registrations] .... (on] certain executive decisions&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link"> Moreover,   it had emerged that the day before his self-destructive evidence   he   had to be ordered to appear at the hearing by SFA vice-president John   McBeth. Farry had intended to travel to Geneva for a conference.  </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The   errors by Scotland&#39;s supposed supreme football law enforcer resulted  in  Burness advising the SFA to settle. They did so immediately for fear  of  the further damage that could follow from allowing the arbitration  to  proceed to a conclusion. In doing so, they paid Celtic&#39;s legal costs  and  gave them a &pound;10,000 compensation payment &ndash; somewhat short of the   &pound;600,000 McCann demanded for the semi-final loss.  Farry was suspended   on full pay and removed from his post permanently two weeks later. He   departed with a &pound;200,000 pay-off that  still rankles with McCann.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The   downfall of the infuriatingly bumptious  SFA secretary/chief executive   of nine years is one that has to be understood in the context of the   infamous workings of the Association.  &quot;Increasingly, he was running the   Association as if it were his personal fiefdom,&quot; one former colleague   reveals. &quot;He had a way that made it very difficult for other voices to   be heard and meant there was no way of suggesting to him he could have   made a mistake. He prided himself on his knowledge of the rule book,  and  had an impressive grasp of it.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">Clearly, he did not have as   solid a grasp as he imagined.  Hubris was a by-product. Every single   piece of mail sent to the SFA would be delivered to his desk at 9am. He   would read all correspondence then forward it to relevant departments.   Replies to letters had to be written as if   composed by him and at 4pm   every day he would sign them off.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">  McCann was also a steely,   single-minded operator but his martinet ways did not extend to this   level of control in his day-to-day business. And neither did his   determination to correct the wrong over Cadete&#39;s  registration amount to   a personal vendetta.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">&quot;At Celtic the Cadete case was not a &#39;get   Farry&#39; exercise,&quot; says a former club official. &quot;Achieving justice on  the  matter certainly became a crusade for Fergus, but then he could go  on a  crusade over a bag of crisps. No one at Celtic, especially him,    thought Jim was working to any agenda. We just thought he had made a   huge mistake  and wanted that recognised. Yes, there was an element of   rubbing the SFA&#39;s noses in it, and therefore Jimmy&#39;s nose in it because     he was the personification of the SFA. But plenty people at Celtic  had  a lot of time for him, could appreciate that he had strong points  and  worked hard. It was never the ultimate aim that he lose his job,  and  that was a surprise.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">But his departure became inevitable,  when  the SFA announced on March 1 that the arbitration had been settled  in  Celtic&#39;s favour. McCann declared Farry&#39;s position untenable. The   settlement including a letter of apology to the club that didn&#39;t best   please Farry. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">His fate was sealed when Burness delivered their   report to the SFA on March 4. In damning fashion, it set out his   &quot;obstructive actions&quot;, the impact of which was, &quot;to  impede the   preparation of the Association&#39;s case, to increase the expense of the   process and to cause material frustration to Counsel who indicated his   dismay at the counter-productive stance adopted in this complex case&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The   following day, at a meeting of the SFA Emergency Committee, the office   bearers unanimously agreed that &quot;the Chief Executive be dismissed from   his executive position and his office as Secretary of the Association  on  the grounds of gross misconduct&quot;.  In Park Gardens, meanwhile, as   they  had since the end of the Cadete affair, employees continued to  sport  broad smiles, walk  the corridors with a free air and even sign   their  own letters.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">WHERE ARE THEY NOW? (2009)</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">JIM FARRY</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">From   East Kilbride he came, to East Kilbride he has returned. Initially   worked as a landscape gardner then went into football administration   when he joined the Scottish Football League in the late 1970s, before   moving to the SFA. Little was heard of him in the years immediately   after his sacking   for his &quot;acts and omissions during the Cadete   affair&quot;. In 2007, however, he was appointed business development manager   for construction and refurbishment firm AKP Scotland Limited. Now 64.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">FERGUS McCANN</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The   removal of Jim Farry, with whom he had several battles &ndash; most notably   over the &pound;53m spent on the redevelopment of &#39;white elephant&#39; Hampden &ndash;   was the last of many disputes he saw through successfully. His  five-year  plan complete, in April 1999 the Scots-Canadian sold his  majority  shareholding  in Celtic for a &pound;29m profit and returned across  the  Atlantic to set up a luxury bus service operating between Boston,  where  he is now based, and New York.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">JORGE CADETE</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Link, Link">The   striker&#39;s season-and-a-bit at Celtic proved to be where he last enjoyed   the scoring form that made him such sensation in his early 20s at   Sporting. Following 33 goals in 43 games in the 1996/97 season, he   claimed mental health problems prevented him returning the following   season, and eventually he moved to Celta Vigo for &pound;3.5m. Later played   for Benfica,   Bradford and   Partick Thistle. In between times, he   appeared in Portuguese Big Brother. Now  makes the odd TV appearance.</span></div>
