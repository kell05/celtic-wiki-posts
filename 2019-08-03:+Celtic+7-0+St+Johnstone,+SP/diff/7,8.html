fine finish.<br><br>Christie added a double before the break, his first a beauty and his second thanks to a Zander Clark error. He made it 4-0 with a cracking strike before Olivier Ntcham, Odsonne Edouard and Leigh Griffiths added goals of their own in a thumping victory.<br><br>The result ensures Celtic sit top of the table on day one and is a clear sign of intent from Neil Lennon&#39;s side, but St Johnstone were miles off the pace as their miserable start to the season continues.<br><br> Lennon thrilled with three-goal Christie<br> Christie hits treble in Celtic romp<br> Predict the Premiership table<br><br>High-class Celtic way too much<br><br>Given their awful League Cup campaign, with losses to Montrose and Forfar, the last place in Scotland that St Johnstone would have wanted to come on opening day was Celtic Park. If those cup defeats were painful for manager Tommy Wright, then this only added to the misery.<br><br>The place was electrified before a ball was kicked, the title flag raised by Liz McNeill and Sadie Chalmers, widows of the great and lamented Billy and Stevie. And Celtic were a blur of movement, imagination and goal threat from the start. When Christie wasn&#39;t causing them bother, it was Johnston. When it wasn&#39;t Johnston, it was James Forrest or Edouard or, later still, Griffiths. It was a high-class victory.<br><br>There was a debut for right-back Hatem Abd Elhamed and he was impressive, too, before he limped off early in the second half. By then, it had become a rout. The only saving grace for the visitors was that the three they had conceded hadn&#39;t become five or six. That pain would come later. Celtic&#39;s speed of thought and hunger for goals was way too much for the Perth side to cope with.<br><br>The champions were ahead after nine minutes when Christie&#39;s cross-field ball was gathered by Johnston, the winger then turning his unfortunate marker, Wallace Duffy, outside, inside and then outside again before slamming his shot past Clark.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s goals total in the league was only 77 last season, a sizeable fall from their average over the course of their first seven titles in their run of eight. Johnston only played in 36% of those games. Christie played in only 60%. Those two alone should ensure their ruthlessness in front of goal rockets skywards. Griffiths scored only twice in the last league campaign. In a better place now with his health, he&#39;s already halfway towards matching what he did a season ago.<br>Leigh Griffiths celebrates<br>Leigh Griffiths completed the rout after coming on as a substitute<br><br>Christie once again hammered home the point about Celtic being a far different attacking proposition when taking Forrest&#39;s pass on the right-hand side of the D and then smashing an unstoppable shot high past Clark. A peach to go with the pearler he got against Nomme Kalju in Europe.<br><br>His second, and Celtic&#39;s third, came just before the half-hour when Christie drilled a shot straight at Clark only for the keeper to let it go by him and into his net. They could have had more before the break, too, with Forrest (twice) and Edouard all creating trouble.<br><br>Just when you thought that the visitors might be spared any more punishment, Christie popped up again. St Johnstone once again gave him space outside the box, Christie once again measured his shot and this outstanding footballer once again lashed a left-footer past Clark via the underside of his crossbar for his hat-trick.<br><br>The thing about it was that it looked effortless. It looked like the type of goal he might fire home in training. It was his sixth in a matter of weeks. Already he&#39;s almost halfway towards his goals total from all of last season.<br><br>More goals followed, Edouard putting Ntcham away just seconds after the Frenchman had come on for the serenaded Christie. Ntcham, with his first touch, thumped home the fifth.<br><br>St Johnstone needed their bus to appear at the side of the pitch to take them away at that point. What they got was Griffiths coming on and putting Edouard away for the sixth, the striker going around Clark before scoring.<br><br>Then, Griffiths rifled in a goal of his own. A seventh and a gorgeous strike on a day of gorgeous strikes. A fitting end to a performance that started really well and only got better after that.<br>Man of the match - Ryan Christie<br><br>Ryan Christie showed his excellence last season, but he looks to have upped it in a very significant way. Christie is a happy amalgam of Callum McGregor and Stuart Armstrong - all the high energy and passing range of the former and all the cleverness and goal threat of the latter, at his 2016-17 season best.<br><br>This was a day when every Celtic player did their stuff, but Christie&#39;s hat-trick stood out. His strikes for his first and third goals were as sweet as you&#39;ll find. Not just that, his influence was constant. Mikey Johnston, Christie and James Forrest are going to cause some amount of mayhem on this evidence.<br>Christie&#39;s stunning start - stats<br>Christie graphic<br>&#39;We&#39;re in a good place&#39; - reaction<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;It&#39;s just been a great day. I&#39;m not getting carried away, but it was an outstanding team performance.<br><br>&quot;Ryan Christie is playing really well right now. His first and third goals were sublime finishes. We are in a good place at the minute. It is a really good marker to put down for the rest of the season.&quot;<br><br>St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: &quot;There were two teams on the pitch - one was absolutely brilliant and the other was poor. We conceded early and did not have enough belief when we had the ball.<br><br>&quot;At least four of the goals are outside of the box with people not doing their jobs. This afternoon shows there is a huge gulf in class of the squads but it&#39;s one we dust ourselves down from.&quot;<br><br>Posted at <br>Match ends, Celtic 7, St. Johnstone 0.<br><b>Full Time</b><br>Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39; <br>Second Half ends, Celtic 7, St. Johnstone 0.<br>Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39; <br>Foul by Leigh Griffiths (Celtic).<br>Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39; <br>Wallace Duffy (St. Johnstone) wins a free kick on the left wing.<br>Posted at 90&#39; <br>Attempt missed.

In a mere five games as permanent manager at the beginning of this fledgling campaign, courtesy of threats being fashioned from all fronts, he has watched his team thunder in 19 goals.<br><br>You have 4 free articles remaining this week<br>Subscribe today<br>X<br><br>Get unlimited online access for &pound;1 per month for 3 months Subscribe Today<br><br>However, whether across the next month they can continue on all front in the vivacious vein that brought a biggest league win in three years; a record scoreline against the Perth side and a first senior hat-trick for a Ryan Christie, who is developing a lethal shoot-on-sight policy, will have much to do with storylines out of their control.<br><br>The Champions League third round qualifier that sees them away to Cluj for the first leg of the tie on Wednesday isn&rsquo;t a gimme. However, Lennon&rsquo;s side appear to have enough in their armoury to find away past the Romanian champions.<br><br>Tomorrow might dictate the likelihood of them following that up by progressing from the play-off round to the promised land of the group stages.<br><br>The lunchtime draw in Nyon could be potentially kind or killing to the Scottish title holders. They would fancy themselves strongly against the winners of third-round meetings between Maribor and Rosenborg and APOEL and Qarabag. That confidence would ebb profoundly were they to find Slavia Prague or Young Boys of Berne &ndash; who both enter the competition at this stage - blocking their path. Young Boys blitzed the Swiss title last season, finishing 20 points above second placed Basel. In the same campaign, they reached the Champions League group stages where they notched a win over Juventus. Moreover, Switzerland is three places above 20th-placed Scotland in the UEFA rankings.<br><br>The Czech Republic is ranked 13th, and that owes much to the efforts of their champions Slavia Prague. They have lost key players over the summer but the core of the squad that knocked-out Seville, Bordeaux and Genk on their way to losing out to eventual winners Chelsea in the quarter-finals of last season&rsquo;s Europa League remain.<br><br>Aside, from this, there is another potential development that could rain on Celtic&rsquo;s parade. Too many sources &ndash; including Lennon &ndash; have too often predicted that Arsenal will return with another offer for Tierney that it seems sure to happen before the English transfer window closes on Thursday.<br><br>It would be inexplicable were the London club to bother submitting another bid in an attempt to bring a resolution to this summer-long saga if it wasn&rsquo;t one that, at last, met Celtic &pound;25m valuation and the requirement to stump that up in good order, and without a reliance on chancey add-ons.<br><br>Tierney&rsquo;s pelvic problems have limited his involvement to nine games in 2019. However talented is the 22-year-old then, and he has the capacity to reach a level beyond Liverpool&rsquo;s Andy Robertson, his influence on the pitch has not been significant for approaching eight months.<br><br>His loss, then, would be felt by the support as much for what he was meant to represent to them: the boy who made good by wearing the shirt and living the dream&rdquo; &ndash; as he used to forever talk about when he was the wide-eyed youth making the breakthrough to the senior ranks.<br>Scottish Premiership Rumour Mill<br>Leicester in for Celtic ace, Rangers &#39;transfer...<br><br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br>Scott Brown jokes with Leigh Griffiths during training<br>Celtic captain Scott Brown feels no added pressure to...<br><br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br>His desire to perform weekly at the very highest level of club football, and earn &pound;75,000-a-week should never be begrudged him, but the Celtic faithful somehow convinced themselves that their club was the be all and end all for a player who was simply one of them who happened to be good enough to be on the pitch rather than watching from the stands.<br><br>They allowed themselves to be blinded to the realities of modern football, just as they did in harbouring a preposterous sense of betrayal when Brendan Rodgers left for a better offer. This consistency never give their board credit for recognising the need to be business-like in how they run their club. Even as their model looks to provide a platform for the title history they crave.  </div>
