Naturally a  quiet,    unassuming man, seeming occasionally to lack the &ldquo;devil&rdquo; that     professional footballers need to possess, Steve was often looked upon  as    a Kelly Kid who would never quite make it. He had his good days,  and   he  had his shockers, but as with almost everyone else, things  changed    dramatically and permanently when Jock Stein came to Celtic.  It was    Steve Chalmers who scored the goal, which won the day in  Lisbon.<br><br>Yet    a little over four years earlier in 1963, one  recalls a dreadful game    at Tannadice Park which Celtic lost 0-3 to an  incredulous home side.   But  Dundee United fans&#39; amazement at the  result against a team who  were  in  the Scottish Cup Final (it was the  Saturday after the  honourable  1-1  draw with Rangers and four days  before the humiliating  Replay) was   nothing in comparison to their  utter shock at the vitriol,  hatred and   foul mouthed abuse hurled at  Steve Chalmers by some who  claimed to be   Celtic supporters.<br><br>True,  he was playing badly.  For some reason he   was being tried on the left  wing where he was  anything but at home,  and  the forward line simply  was not functioning.  As often happens when   someone is having a  shocker, the ball kept  coming to him and he was   continually losing  it, being robbed,  misdirecting a pass and even   sometimes running the  ball out of play.  This in no way excused the   behaviour of the boo  boys, and one would  like to have seen their   reaction at Lisbon. I  would like to think that  some of them apologised.<br><br>Steve   was  born in 1936. His father  David Chalmers had played alongside Jimmy    McGrory for Clydebank, and  from an early age, young Steve revealed a    penchant for the game. His  career suffered a set back and indeed his    life was endangered when he  took meningitis, but he recovered well    enough to play for the  traditional Rangers nursery of Ashfield before    joining Celtic in 1959,  at the age of 23 possibly on the old side to  be a   true Kelly Kid.<br><br>For  as long as Jock Stein was in charge  of the   youngsters, things were  tolerably sane, but when Jock moved to    Dunfermline, things became  chaotic and haphazard. There was no real    development programme and  youngsters were pitched into the first team    long before they were  ready. Team selections were crazy and    inconsistent, League points were  habitually lost to weaker teams, and    Cup Finals were reached only for  the team to collapse badly in the    Final.<br><br>Yet Chalmers  maintained his dignity through all this. He    always was well dressed  and a perfect role model for youngsters,  rarely   in trouble with  referees or authorities and capable of some  fine   performances. He was  even on the fringe of the Scotland team,  often in   the squad, but it  would be some time before he could oust  the likes of   Alan Gilzean and  Ian St. John. He did however  distinguish himself in a   few games for  the Scottish League team.<br><br>It  would be fair to say   the Stevie  reached his peak in 1964 before Jock  Stein arrived. He had a   brilliant  start to that season, scoring two  great goals to beat Rangers   in the  rain at Parkhead in early  September, then rescuing his team  from a   rather large hole against  East Fife in the League Cup Quarter  Final.   The Fifers had beaten  Celtic 2-0 at Methil in the First Leg, and    humiliation beckoned until  Stevie notched 5 at Parkhead in the Second    Leg.<br><br>Form like  this earned him his first of five Scotland caps   in  October 1964, but  tragedy struck the Celtic side when they lost the    League Cup Final to  a lucky but clinical Rangers side. Chalmers  thought   he had the ball  over the line early in the second half but  referee  Hugh  Phillips was  unimpressed by Chalmers&#39; impassioned appeal,  and the   Kelly/McGrory  regime never recovered from this debacle. The  autumn and   winter of  that year saw dreadful times and even after the  appointment  of  Jock  Stein in January 1965, recovery was far from  certain.<br><br>Chalmers    was now on the right wing as Jimmy Johnstone  (having been sent off on    New Year&#39;s Day at Ibrox) was temporarily out  of favour and John  Hughes   was in the centre. And Stevie played his  part in the capture  of the   Scottish Cup in 1965, as the glory days  were launched. Bertie  Auld was   now there in the forward line, and  Stevie and Bertie, two  entirely   different characters, reacted well to  each other<br><br>Chalmers  might   have seen the arrival of Joe McBride  and Willie Wallace and  the   re-invention of Jimmy Johnstone in the  early Stein years as some  sort of   threat to his place. But Stein was  far too impressed by  Chalmers&#39;   dedication and commitment to the Cause  to allow Stevie to  become   disheartened. Chalmers was of course used to  the chopping and  changing   of a forward line. It had happened all his  Parkhead life,  but the   difference here was that there was some thought  behind it.  Stein would   often say &ldquo;Horses for Courses&rdquo;. There was  seldom a more  willing horse   than Steve Chalmers &ndash; and Jock would  normally find a  place for him in an   important game like a European  match or a Cup  Final.<br><br>Chalmers   won a League medal in 1966 and  then reached  one of the peaks of an   already remarkable career when he  scored for  Scotland against Brazil in a   game that Brazil had arranged  as a World  Cup warm-up. It was a fine   goal too, early in the game, and  much  admired by Pele and the other   Brazilian legends.<br><br>The  Lisbon  year of 1967 was of course marked   by Stevie&#39;s winning goal,  that  marvellous touch-on of Murdoch&#39;s powerful   drive. But he is also  due a  great deal of credit for scoring the first   goal against  Vojvodina  and for running his socks off in Prague as the   only forward  in that  nerve-wracking Semi Final. Considering that he was   30 by that  time,  the amount of running he put in was remarkable. And   this was as  well  as winning a Scottish domestic Treble!<br><br>He won   League  medals in  1968 and 1969, and played his part in that glorious   April of  1969  when the team won all three Scottish trophies. It was he   who  scored  the fourth goal in the rout of Rangers in the Scottish Cup    Final,  something that paid them back for 1963 and other horror stories    of  Chalmers&#39; early career.<br><br>Stevie had the misfortune to break  his    leg in the League Cup Final win over St.Johnstone in October 1969,  and    seldom played again for Celtic, joining Morton in September 1971,   and   beginning more and more to enjoy his round of golf. In later   years, he   would become the Celtic Pools organiser and would visit the   house of   anyone who might wish to become an Agent. Many a fan   volunteered for   this job, simply because it involved a knock on your   door from the man   who scored the winning goal in Lisbon.<br><br>Stevie&#39;s   son Paul played a   few games for the Club in the mid-1980s, but never   reached the heights   of his illustrious father. Indeed they would  have  been difficult to   reach, for Steve Chalmers scored 241 goals for  the  Club, something that   entitles him to be mentioned in the same  breath  as Jimmy McGrory, Bobby   Lennox, Henrik Larsson and Jimmy  Quinn. That  says it all, really.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div><h3>  </h3><h3>  Interview: Stevie Chalmers, Celtic legend</h3>The Scotsman<br><br>By AIDAN SMITH<br>Published on Saturday 15 September 2012 00:00<br><br>A     COUPLE of years ago, en route to another football rendezvous, my     Glasgow taxi driver wanted to know why I wasn&rsquo;t interviewing his friend     from the golf club, an ex-player with a unique story to tell, though    the  cabby had to concede that Stevie Chalmers probably wouldn&rsquo;t want  to    tell it, seeing as he was such a modest fellow.<br><br>&ldquo;A shame,&rdquo;  he    said, &ldquo;because some of the other Lisbon Lions have had more than  one    book published and yet Stevie scored the goal that won the  European  Cup.   Think about that; it&rsquo;s probably something we&rsquo;ll never  see a  Scottish   team do again.&rdquo; I asked the cabby for Chalmers&rsquo; phone  number,  hoping I   might get the chance to meet him one day, and now I  do.<br><br>Chalmers    lives in Troon, the prim and perjink and pampas  grass-resplendent   little  Ayrshire town dominated by his other great  love. The golfers are   all  wearing woolly hats today as protection  against the stiff breeze   but the  Celtic legend, still sporting a fine  head of hair at 76,   doesn&rsquo;t need  one. He&rsquo;s waiting for me at the  train station, his VW   parked in a prime  spot. &ldquo;The taxi boys don&rsquo;t  normally let you stop here   but, ach, they saw  it was me,&rdquo; he says.  Don&rsquo;t go thinking, though,   that Chalmers lords his  fitba&rsquo; fame around  these parts. As we&rsquo;ve   established, he&rsquo;s not that  kind of guy.<br><br>&ldquo;I  wasn&rsquo;t going to write   a book,&rdquo; he continues as  rain pitter-pats on  the roof of the small   conservatory to the rear of  his bungalow and  his wife Sadie fetches   tea. He doesn&rsquo;t say what changed  his mind but  you get the feeling that   changing it back again and not  lending his  name to The Winning Touch   wouldn&rsquo;t have been a tragedy for  him. The  memoirs, ghostwritten, have   been serialised in a tabloid and  Chalmers  is perturbed by the headline   on the very latest extracts: &ldquo;I  hated  Jock for Celts axe.&rdquo; He winces.   &ldquo;I would never say I hated  anyone.&rdquo;  The offending word does appear in   the book, in the chapter on  the sad  end to his Hoops career in 1971   when he was moved on to Morton,  but  it&rsquo;s clear from the rest of the   text that his relationship with the   Big Jock wasn&rsquo;t straightforward and   of course neither was winning   European Cups.<br><br>At one point in   the book Chalmers says: &ldquo;I did  not  find him [Stein] to be the most   supportive of people.&rdquo; Four pages  later  comes the revelation: &ldquo;He never   spoke to me at length about  anything.&rdquo;  But six pages after that   there&rsquo;s a description of the  manager&rsquo;s  revolutionary approach to   team-talks and how, through,  detailed analysis  of the opposition on the   tactics board, each player  left the briefings  with a &ldquo;mini-movie&rdquo; in   their heads of how the  upcoming game was going to  unfold.<br><br>Chalmers   was never the type  to mump and moan and bang on  the manager&rsquo;s door  so,  he reckons, was  easier to drop than others. The  only time he was   hugged by Stein was  after a lonely and extremely  bruising shift as the   solitary striker  away to Dukla Prague, the   semi-final tie that sent   Celtic to Lisbon.  Jock was the boss &ldquo;and that  was that,&rdquo; the book   confirms. He could  make players do exactly what he  wanted. On the rare   occasions they  didn&rsquo;t, and they were sat beside him  on the bench, he&rsquo;d   point to  those playing in their places and  rubbish  the new men. &ldquo;He   was so  cute it was incredible,&rdquo; says Chalmers now. Just  one hug and  yet  &ldquo;he  knew better than anyone what was good for me&rdquo;. To  sum up: a   genius.<br><br>We&rsquo;ll  return to the Stein Years but let&rsquo;s go  back to the   very start for  the old centre-forward because he almost  didn&rsquo;t see   Lisbon or  anything of his glorious 1960s when he was Celtic&rsquo;s    pre-eminent  goalgrabber. At the age of 20, then playing for    Kirkintilloch Rob  Roy, he was struck down by tuberculosis meningitis. &ldquo;I    didn&rsquo;t know  what it was, or what it meant for me.&rdquo; Tuberculosis    bacteria had  entered the fluid surrounding his brain and spinal cord and     ironically Chalmers was holed up in the Belvidere hospital a  goal-kick    from Parkhead where he&rsquo;d  really wanted to be.<br><br>&ldquo;I was  getting    lumbar punctures: kneeling on the bed, a nurse holding me in  position    while a doctor went in with his syringe,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;Boy,  that was    tough, although in the early days I still didn&rsquo;t think my  condition  was   too serious. Then I noticed how my fellow patients kept   disappearing.   The curtains would be dragged right round their beds   before they were   wheeled away. I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to do very much which   for a young   sportsman was hard. When no one was looking I&rsquo;d drop my   legs over the   side of the bed to try and get them moving. I&rsquo;d like to   think my good   health and fitness helped me. I know that Dr Peter   McKenzie helped me.   He was the head consultant at the Belvidere and   after I&rsquo;d made a full   recovery he let me see a film he&rsquo;d made of my   treatment which he was   going to show round Canada and the United   States. He told me that no one   with tuberculosis meningitis had been   walking out of the hospital   alive. I suppose I was his star patient.&rdquo;<br><br>Chalmers&rsquo;   idol, in   football and in life, was his father David. &ldquo;I worshipped   him and wanted   to emulate him. He played alongside [future Celtic   legend] Jimmy   McGrory at Clydebank in the 1920s and was capped for   Scotland as a   Junior.&rdquo; Born four years before the outbreak of war but   not restricted   by it, he&rsquo;d practice heading against the walls of his   bomb shelter   whenever the Luftwaffe threatened Glasgow. The family&rsquo;s   tenement flat   overlooking Glasgow&rsquo;s Alexandra Parade came with a  rope,  to be used for   canal rescues. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t swim so I avoided  that  canal. Being the baby   of the family, I suppose my father was  quite  protective of me. He was a   quiet man by nature but he&rsquo;d take me  on  long walks and tell me stories   about Jimmy McGrory and we always  had a  ball with us. He also told me   how important it was to avoid  trouble  and I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve always   heeded his words.&rdquo;<br><br>Chalmers&rsquo;   time in Paradise, 12 years all  told,  has two drastically different   phases: before Stein and after.  Pre-Big  Jock was a strange interlude;   he labels it &ldquo;eccentric&rdquo;. &ldquo;We  were a big  club with a big support but   we were run like a small  business. On  match-days the rumour was that   Desmond White, the  secretary, would take a  quick look across the   terraces and mutter the  first figure that came  into his head &ndash; 23,000,   say &ndash; and that would be  recorded as the official  attendance.&rdquo; Even   though McGrory was the  manager, it was chairman Bob  Kelly who picked   the team. And when  Chalmers was first to arrive for  training &ndash; &ldquo;I   reckoned I had to work  harder than the other guys because  of my   illness&rdquo; &ndash; and he&rsquo;d try to  sneak in some ball-work in the  gymnasium,   the heavy sphere would be  snatched from him and locked away.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll   see enough of it on  Saturday,&rdquo; he was told.<br><br>When training    properly got under way,  two balls would be used. &ldquo;But if one was punted    over the stand you&rsquo;d be  struggling,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Under Jock,   though,  everybody had a ball.  That made us feel more professional.   Celtic at  that time needed a  revolution and we couldn&rsquo;t have had a   better man for  it. The board knew  that they weren&rsquo;t to bother him;   he&rsquo;d run the team  his way. And he was  as anxious as we were to win   something. Just winning  the Old Firm game  would have been a start.&rdquo;<br><br>Chalmers   had scored  on his Old Firm  debut, the 1960 Scottish Cup final, and   would be  congratulated for the  goal in a letter from Dr McKenzie, a   Rangers fan,  hailing him as &ldquo;a  triumph of modern medicine&rdquo; &ndash; but   Celtic were beaten  in the replay and  got into a losing habit in the   fixture. So when he  netted a hat-trick  for Stein in the 1966 Ne&rsquo;er Day   game, the Hoops  coming from behind to  win 5-1, he was delighted and   thought the boss  would be, too.<br><br>&ldquo;What  manager wouldn&rsquo;t throw   you up in the air,  catch you and give you a  cuddle? But Jock just   glowered at me!&rdquo; he  laughs. &ldquo;Then he told me he  wouldn&rsquo;t have picked   me as man of the match,  that Yogi [John Hughes]  deserved it. Maybe he   did that for my own good,  in case I got a big  head. I&rsquo;d like to think  I  wouldn&rsquo;t. But I do  understand Jock&rsquo;s motives  much better now when   maybe I didn&rsquo;t at the  time.&rdquo;<br><br>Did Stein have  favourites? &ldquo;All   managers do. I don&rsquo;t think  I was one of them but he  held Billy   [McNeill] in great regard. He had a  special relationship  with Wee   Jinky [Jimmy Johnstone] as well although  there were times he  could   have killed him! I remember how he used to  gather us round for a  talk   and as he was speaking Jimmy would be playing  keepy-uppy at the  back   and then the wee man would dribble round him.  Jimmy wasn&rsquo;t being    deliberately disruptive; he just needed to be playing  with a ball the    whole time. No one else would have gotten away with  that.&rdquo;<br><br>Did    any of the players speak at these meetings or dare  challenge Stein?    &ldquo;Well, if anyone did it would probably be Bertie [Auld]  and maybe Tam    Gemmell was second-bravest. I don&rsquo;t think I ever spoke. I  knew my    place!&rdquo; And Chalmers&rsquo; place on 25 May, 1967 &ndash; the glorious  conclusion    to a season where before every match Stein had urged &ldquo;Go out  and    entertain these people&rdquo; and Celtic had won every trophy available to     them &ndash; was bang on the six-yard line making a brilliant nuisance of     himself in front of Inter Milan&rsquo;s fine  goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti for     the strike which would win the European Cup.<br><br>Chalmers suffered     disappointments in football, not least in the dark blue, and although  he    was happy to win a Junior cap like his dear old dad, five senior     appearances for Scotland is a small return for such a prolific     centre-forward. On international trips he roomed with Denis Law and as     the squad broke up the Lawman always thanked him in front of the  others    for being such a good butler &ndash; but he scored in his first two     appearances only to be omitted by the selectors; he netted our     first-ever goal against Brazil but was dropped for the next game; and he     was down as 12th man for the &ldquo;unofficial champions of the world&rdquo; win     over England until Celtic team-mate Willie Wallace nicked his place.     These are familiar tales, though. Chalmers knows many were similarly     frustrated and he&rsquo;s careful not to complain too much. For he will      always have Lisbon and what happened in the 84th minute.<br><br>Long     before then, Chalmers had been everywhere a poacher shouldn&rsquo;t be:     right-half and even right-back as he and Bobby Lennox deferred to the     thunderous shooting of Gemmell, Auld and Bobby Murdoch. &ldquo;We will attack     and keep on attacking until we win this game,&rdquo; had been Stein&rsquo;s    promise.  But, watching on fuzzy black-and-white TV as a boy, your    correspondent  was convinced Murdoch had scored the winner.<br><br>&ldquo;Do    you know we  practiced getting these wee nicks in training? Balls would    be fired  across, deliberately miscued, and Yogi, Willie and myself   and,  before he  got injured, poor Joe McBride would try and steer them   in. I  even  remember Jock swinging his big left leg at a couple.   Against  Inter, I&rsquo;d  been all over the pitch &ndash; we all had &ndash; and their   defenders  were great  markers but they were getting tired. I knew what   Bobby  Murdoch was going  to do &ndash; pile it in &ndash; and I&rsquo;d made up my mind   what I  was going to do,  too. I waited on the blind side of their   sweeper and  nipped in front of  him at the very last moment.&rdquo;<br><br>Chalmers   still  gets asked about the  84th minute. Every matchday at Parkhead,   he&rsquo;ll  drive up with the  Saltcoats-based Lennox for hospitality  duties.  A  hoary argument over why  Chalmers didn&rsquo;t pass to his chum  for the  last  goal in another final  will be re-enacted on the journey  and  they&rsquo;ll  count the Bentleys in the  players&rsquo; car park before  meeting up  with the  other &pound;45-a-week immortals.  &ldquo;Bertie always wants  to hug you;  some of  the guys just shake hands. And  one of us will aye  remark on  how we&rsquo;re  shrinking and getting that bit  closer to the  ground.&rdquo;  Chalmers has his  own chair, which given he was  perpetual  motion that  famous day seems  fitting, and it&rsquo;s the guests who  do the  rounds, all  of them keen to  know: &ldquo;How did you feel scoring it  ...  what like was  it?&rdquo;<br><br>The  unassuming hero smiles. &ldquo;One of the   players who came  after me, George  McCluskey, will shout at them for a   laugh: &lsquo;Look at  you lot, queuing  up. What&rsquo;s he done? He only scored  one  goal!&rsquo;&rdquo; And  some of the liggers  will be quite bold, daring to  suggest  that  Murdoch&rsquo;s shot hit off his  right instep, that he knew  very little   about it. But Stevie Chalmers  knew a lot about that goal  and his  manager  knew even more. What did  Stein say to him after the  final  whistle,  freed from the embraces of  Bill Shankly and dozens of   delirious fans?  &ldquo;Nothing. He never mentioned  the goal. But I didn&rsquo;t   expect him to, and  nor was I especially upset  about that. I was the   centre-forward; it was  my job.&rdquo;<br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  I was at gates to Paradise... but not in way I had dreamed</h3>Stevie Chalmers on his six-month fight for life<br>By STEVIE CHALMERS, , The Sun<br>Published: 09th September 2012<br><br>EVEN    when the ambulance screeched to a halt outside our house and the    orderlies came panting up the stairs, I still didn&rsquo;t think there was    anything seriously wrong.<br><br>I was a young and very fit man. One so    active in sport that, at 20 years old, I was still trying to decide    whether I ought to pursue a career in top-level football or in    professional golf.<br><br>It was unfathomable to me there could be any serious problem with my health.<br><br>But that illusion was soon utterly destroyed.<br><br>I was rushed from my home in Balornock to Belvidere Hospital, a stone&rsquo;s throw from Celtic Park.<br><br>It    had long been a private ambition of mine for there to be a special    place reserved for me at Parkhead. But not in a hospital ward for the    terminally ill.<br><br>The chance to enter Paradise had just drawn a good deal closer &mdash; but not in the way I wished.<br><br>I&rsquo;d    been playing Junior football for Kirkintilloch Rob Roy, happily    awaiting my chance of being snapped up by a senior professional club,    when I became ill.<br><br>It had seemed, initially, to be nothing more than a mild feeling of not being quite right in myself.<br><br>But, just to err on the side of caution, the doctor came out to see me and he immediately had me whisked into hospital.<br><br>At Belvidere they diagnosed me with TBM &mdash; tuberculosis meningitis &mdash; an extremely rare condition.<br><br>I didn&rsquo;t know what it was exactly or what it meant for me, although I knew it was serious.<br><br>I know now that it means that tuberculosis bacteria have entered the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.<br><br>I was given intensive treatment, including lumbar punctures three or four times a week.<br><br>It was only after I&rsquo;d been in the ward for a few weeks the reality of my situation struck me fully.<br><br>Too many of my fellow patients were passing away for me to hide from the truth any longer.<br><br>There    were, in that ward, some people slightly younger than myself, some    children, who had been stricken with polio, and older people who had    contracted tuberculosis.<br><br>Often I witnessed members of the medical    staff gathering anxiously around somebody&rsquo;s bed before the curtain  was   drawn solemnly all the way round.<br><br>Then the lifeless body of the patient in question would be wheeled out of the ward.<br><br>It also seemed ominous that I had been set down in ward 13.<br><br>From being impatient to be released from that old hospital, it soon got to the stage where I was happy simply to be alive.<br><br>My    greatest emotion soon became extreme frustration as I was prevented    from going outside the ward to walk about. It was as if we were    condemned, cut off from society.<br><br>This was exceptionally hard on a young sportsman whose entire life had been based on athletic activity.<br><br>I    wasn&rsquo;t allowed to do very much at all but, when nobody was looking, I    would put my legs over the side of the bed and get them moving. I   didn&rsquo;t  want to get stiff, and if anyone came along I would quickly have   to get  my legs back up on to the bed and under the sheets. I do feel   the high  levels of good health and strength I&rsquo;d built up before I   became ill  helped me endure both the illness and the severity of the   necessary  treatment.<br><br>Seeing those other poor people succumb to   their  various conditions encouraged me to fight even harder to make   sure I  left the ward alive and well.<br><br>I was inside that hospital for six dreary months. I spent my 21st birthday in the Belvidere.<br><br>Eventually    it appeared as though I was clear of the illness and I was  transferred   to a nursing home in Touch, near Stirling. I spent six  weeks there in a   big, old house, convalescing in a quiet atmosphere. I  felt my health   returning very gradually.<br><br>Dr Peter McKenzie, a  physician who   specialised in infectious diseases, was the man who had  overseen my   progress in his role as the head consultant at Belvidere  Hospital.

Stevie Chalmers scores against Inter Milan<br>By DEREK McGREGOR, The Sun<br>Published: 09th September 2012<br><br>IN    the wake of the European Cup Final Jock Stein never, ever took me   aside  and expressed gratitude or special appreciation for the goal that   I had  scored.<br><br>Not that I was looking for it or felt particularly upset that it never happened.<br><br>That was just Jock.<br><br>As centre-forward my job in the team was to score goals and that was what I had done on the day.<br><br>From    Jock&rsquo;s point of view there was probably no need to draw any special    attention to the fact I had been the one who had scored.<br><br>I had been, as he probably saw it, simply doing my work.<br><br>That goal against Inter Milan has brought me nothing but happiness.<br><br>It    meant a lot to my family too in the immediate aftermath. My brothers    and sisters would go into work and people would congratulate them on  my   action.<br><br>My only tinge of regret is that my father never got to see it. He had passed away shortly before we got to the final in Lisbon.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve been asked many times how I felt after I&rsquo;d scored that goal in Lisbon.<br><br>The answer is EXHAUSTED.<br><br>I could feel cramp coming on after an afternoon pounding the pitch at the National Stadium in that sapping heat.<br><br>But the goal pepped me up somewhat and enabled me to see through the final five minutes.<br><br>After my goal, we knew we had won the European Cup.<br><br>Anyone    watching that final closely would see right from the start that the    Celtic players were taking up unexpected positions. It was Jock&rsquo;s    intention to outmanoeuvre the Italians by coming up with the unexpected.<br><br>Once    we were on the field we had to adjust to the development of the game    and work out for ourselves the best way to continue to bedazzle the    Inter players.<br><br>We were all tuned into the idea. I felt strongly that this was our big chance and that we might never get this chance again.<br><br>During    the first half, I didn&rsquo;t get the ball as much as I expected,   especially  in a match in which we had so much possession and were   continually  going forward.<br><br>I was being marked by Gianfranco   Bedin, but by  moving around I was taking him into stupid places and   leaving a gap in  their defence into which one of our players could take   the ball.<br><br>As  the match wound towards its end, though, I&rsquo;d had   enough of veering here  and there away from my position and not really   getting on the ball very  much.<br><br>I decided the time was right for me to get back where I belonged.<br><br>Having    unsettled and confused the Italians by straying from my position for   so  long, perhaps the last place they now expected me to pop up was in   the  heart of their penalty area.<br><br>All afternoon I had been  making  runs  to free up space for other people and in the 85th minute &mdash;  as  Tommy  Gemmell played Bobby Murdoch in for a shot at goal &mdash; I had  the  favour  returned, beautifully.<br><br>As the ball left Bobby&rsquo;s foot, I had an inkling it was not going to be on target.<br><br>I    nipped in and hit the ball, first time, with the instep of my right    boot and it went to the left of Giuliano Sarti, leaving him standing,    frozen.<br><br>It didn&rsquo;t immediately hit me just how important that  goal   was when I scored it. You don&rsquo;t want to think about it too much  until   the game&rsquo;s finished.<br><br>But when my goal went in it was  almost as   though the Inter players were relieved it would soon be all  over. They   had been run off their feet by us. It had been the complete  team   performance from Celtic. Well, apart from Jim Craig&rsquo;s slip in  giving   away the penalty. But we&rsquo;ll say no more about that.<br><br>There were some terrific individual performances from our players on the day in Lisbon.<br><br>But we won the European Cup as a team.<br><br>For us it was the match of our lives &mdash; a match we had to win.<br><br>This game meant an awful lot more to us than it did to the Italians.<br><br>Prior    to every match that season, Jock had told us that it could turn out  to   be an extraordinary season for us. His words gathered weight as the    season rolled on and we had won everything else in sight &mdash; Scottish    League, Scottish Cup and League Cup.<br><br>So by the time we got to Lisbon we really believed anything was possible for us.<br><br>Without Jock we would not have reached the final.<br><br>The goal Tommy Gemmell scored in the 63rd minute was the perfect equaliser. Everything about it was just wonderful.<br><br>And    once the Inter goal had been breached, it was only a matter of time    until it happened again. There was so much glorious confusion and chaos    afterwards, so much singing and shouting in the dressing room, that  we   didn&rsquo;t even know Billy McNeill was away up to get the cup.<br><br>Once he had returned to the dressing room it was filled with alcoholic beverages and we all had a refreshing sip.<br><br>Jock, who was tee-total, refrained. He later celebrated with a cup of tea.<br><br>Jimmy McGrory was a wonderful person, a manager who was always very kind to me and for whom I had enormous affection.<br><br>But    I felt the same surge of excitement as everyone else at the club when  I   heard in January, 1965, that Jock would be leaving Hibernian and    returning to Celtic as manager. We knew things would improve under him &mdash;    it was simply a question of how far and how fast.<br><br>That is not to say that my progress under him was serene and smooth.<br><br>One    of my most notable achievements with Jock at the helm arrived ten    months after he had taken charge, when we came up against Rangers at    Celtic Park in the derby match that would usher in the New Year of 1966.<br><br>I    was delighted with my hat-trick in a 5-1 win. It makes me one of only    three Celtic players to have scored a hat-trick in an Old Firm league    match, putting me alongside greats Jimmy Quinn and Malky MacDonald.<br><br>When I came into the dressing room after the match I have to say that I was pretty pleased with myself. And it must have shown.<br><br>I    thought the manager would be absolutely delighted for me. But instead  I   received a glower from Jock, who quickly attempted to puncture any    self-satisfaction that I might be feeling.<br><br>&lsquo;Just to let you    know,&rsquo; he said in his quietly forceful fashion, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have picked    you as the man of the match. I thought Yogi Hughes had a great game,   out  on the wing&rsquo;.<br><br>In all the years I played under him as Celtic manager, I did not find Jock to be the most supportive of people.<br><br>But the greatest effect he had was to transform us from perennial losers into winners.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>I&rsquo;m glad wee Billy put the boot into Pele.. it made sure that I got his shirt</h3>WHAT A SIGNING ... Stevie Chalmers scored against Brazil stars and bagged special souvenir from Pele<br>By DEREK McGREGOR, The Sun<br>Published: 08th September 2012<br><br>IT&rsquo;S a great thing to have your name still recognised for playing and scoring against Brazil.<br><br>After all, they haven&rsquo;t lost too many goals to Scottish teams.<br><br>And getting the shirt of the legendary Pele made it even more special for me.<br><br>David    Narey, with his wonderful goal against them at the World Cup in 1982,    and John Collins, with a penalty in 1998, are the only other Scots  who   have put the ball behind a Brazilian goalkeeper.<br><br>It was a    wonderful occasion, with a huge Saturday-evening Hampden Park crowd    appreciative of our efforts against the world champions. Brazil also    fielded players of the calibre of Jairzinho, Bellini, Gerson and    Amarildo.<br><br>But it was clear to me, on a professional level, that the samba stars were saving themselves to a certain extent.<br><br>Our players had really wanted to put on a show against the No1 team in the world, not long after we&rsquo;d lost 1-0 to Portugal.<br><br>But the Brazilians had a bigger prize in sight &mdash; the 1966 World Cup finals down in England.<br><br>Pele was a strong fellow, stronger than you might realise given how gracefully and lithely he moved across a football pitch.<br><br>But    at Hampden he would try to keep out of tackles and the heftier    challenges. He clearly didn&rsquo;t want to suffer any injuries as he looked    forward to the World Cup.<br><br>Billy Bremner, though, did everything to try to stop Pele destroying us.<br><br>He was right on top of him, trying to knock him out of his stride.<br><br>The Brazilians later complained about the &lsquo;rough handling&rsquo; Pele had received from Bremner.<br><br>But    I was quite happy that they had been up in arms about Billy&rsquo;s   treatment  of the world&rsquo;s pre-eminent footballer. Had Billy been a bit   gentler,  played it more like a friendly, I might not have found myself   with  Pele&rsquo;s shirt.<br><br>I was thrilled once I discovered that I had   been  selected by John Prentice to play in the game, and excited to be   playing  against such a team and finding out for myself whether they   were just  as good as they had looked on television.<br><br>Before the match, we went out on to the park for a warm-up and the Brazilians were kicking in at goal.<br><br>I couldn&rsquo;t take my eyes off Pele.<br><br>I said to Jim Baxter: &lsquo;Look at Pele. Isn&rsquo;t he brilliant?&rsquo;<br><br>Jim replied, in his lilting, broad Fife accent, totally cocksure: &lsquo;Never mind Pele... wait until you see ME.&rsquo;<br><br>Baxter    was as good as his word that day. He strolled through the game. He  was   super. And within a minute of the start I was in dreamland.<br><br>Baxter    pinged a beautiful ball in my direction and, feeling fresh and eager,  I   got round Fidelis, the right-back, and, slightly off balance, got  good   contact on the ball with my right foot and clipped a shot past  Gilmar,   the Brazil goalkeeper, from just outside the six-yard box.<br><br>He had no chance of saving it and the ball nestled in the net.<br><br>My    immediate sensation was one of almost uncontainable delight at  scoring   for my country in front of a wonderfully large Hampden Park  crowd.<br><br>Sadly, Servilio equalised for Brazil after quarter of an hour&rsquo;s play.<br><br>The game finished 1-1, with great credit to Scotland.<br><br>Bremner    had clearly come to the conclusion that the only way to stop Pele was    to injure him, which was not a very nice way to go about things.<br><br>So    when the final whistle blew and Billy made a beeline straight for  Pele   to exchange jerseys, Pele waved our fiery redhead away and  instead   turned around in MY direction and offered to swap with me  instead.<br><br>I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.<br><br>Pele&rsquo;s    jersey is one of my favourite souvenirs of my time in football, even    though I was never one to go looking for jerseys from big-name  opponents   at the end of a match.<br><br>He didn&rsquo;t speak very much English so he didn&rsquo;t say anything significant to me as we exchanged shirts.<br><br>But I was just so happy to wait for him to peel the jersey over his head and say thank you.<br><br>It    may seem strange, but even though we were about to face two of the   most  accomplished teams to participate in the 1966 World Cup, in the   shape  of Portugal and Brazil, some Scottish players had opted to have a   couple  of extra weeks on the beach rather than perform for their   country.<br><br>I would never have taken that option.<br><br>Nor  was I   craving a holiday myself, even after a lengthy, demanding season  and a   long tour across the Pond with Celtic that had followed on   immediately  from our winning the Scottish League Championship and also   reaching  both domestic cup finals and the semis of the European   Cup-Winners&rsquo;  Cup.<br><br>Brazil saw the match with Scotland as   assimilation for  playing in British conditions and for meeting the type   of northern  European opposition &ndash; especially England themselves &ndash;  that  might be  encountered in the World Cup finals.<br><br>I remain proud of our performance.<br><br>Denis Law was my room-mate while on international duty and Denis would kid on: &lsquo;Hey you, my boots need brought down.&rsquo;<br><br>It was all just joking and keeping everyone together.<br><br>Denis    was actually very good to me &ndash; at the end of each trip he would    generously make a point of thanking me in front of everyone else...<br><br>For having been such a good BUTLER to him.<br><br>When    Ian McColl left the post of Scotland manager and Jock Stein took over    from him, on a part-time basis, during the second half of 1965, my    chances of further Scotland caps may have seemed, from the outside, to    have brightened considerably.<br><br>But Jock would overlook me for Scotland entirely during that period.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Supersnub</h3>By ROBERT MARTIN, The Sun<br>Published: 10th March 2011<br><br>STEVIE    CHALMERS revealed Pele sought him out to hand him his famous No10    Brazil shirt &mdash; because he DIDN&rsquo;T want Billy Bremner to get his hands on    it!<br><br>The Lisbon Lion put John Prentice&rsquo;s Scotland side ahead in    the first minute in the 1-1 draw with the then world champions back in    June 1966.<br><br>Some 45 years on Chalmers admits the Samba  superstar&rsquo;s   actions at the end of the Hampden clash are as vivid to  him as the  goal  he scored.<br><br>Bremner tracked Pele for the entire  game and  when the  full-time whistle blew headed straight for the  world&rsquo;s  greatest player  to ask for his jersey.<br><br>Pele, brassed off by Bremner&rsquo;s bruising treatment, REFUSED and turned to Chalmers instead.<br><br>Chalmers said: &ldquo;I was lucky enough to get Pele&rsquo;s jersey and I still have it.<br><br>&ldquo;Billy wanted the shirt, and Pele knew he wanted it as well.<br><br>&ldquo;Billy had kicked lumps out of Pele during the game, so when he asked him for his shirt he said no.<br><br>&ldquo;I was close by at this stage and he turned and gave it to me.

To    Chalmers, the silence that follows does not need to be filled with    gratuitous remarks. He would, by his nature, consider any triumphant    words an act of self-indulgence.<br><br>His modest nature must feel at    times that the feats of his career have to be tolerated. His regular    visits to Celtic Park are taken up by endless reminiscing. There tend  to   be queues of people waiting to return him to the 1960s, as if   nostalgia  is the only mood he provokes. Chalmers is happy to ransack   his  memories, though, even if it is to take the opportunity to downplay   his  own importance to Celtic&#39;s history.<br><br>For a time, he did  not  even  take note of his standing among the club&#39;s strikers. The  records  are  second nature to him now, not least because they are  constantly  used to  introduce him. He is Celtic&#39;s fourth top scorer of  all time,  and  averaged a goal every two games for the club. Yet in  truth, one  goal was  enough to endear Chalmers to every generation of  the Celtic  support.<br><br>He  is often asked about the strike that  won the  European Cup in 1967,  mostly by fans who wonder if he was  aware of his  foot diverting Bobby  Murdoch&#39;s shot and sending the ball  beyond  Giuliano Sarti, the  Internazionale goalkeeper. On first  impression the  finish can seem  fortunate, but like much of Celtic&#39;s  display in Lisbon,  it had been  meticulously planned by Jock Stein. The  manager often  drilled his  strikers in training to take up positions  inside the  penalty area to  take advantage of shots from long range.  &quot;Jock was the  whole answer to  our great run,&quot; Chalmers said firmly.  &quot;You can&#39;t doubt  that.&quot;<br><br>Like  the rest of the Lisbon Lions, he  must constantly  relive that triumph.  The subject will seem poignant at  Celtic Park  tomorrow night, when the  club hosts Benfica in the  Champions League.  After the draw for the group  stages, some  sharp-witted Celtic  supporters pointed out that fate had  been cruel to  Spartak Moscow in  pitching them in against three former  winners of  the trophy. History  provides clubs with their sense of  identity and  esteem, but the  contemporary game has encouraged an elite  to develop,  and only  Barcelona of the four teams in Group G can be  thought of as  genuine  contenders.<br><br>That scenario saddens  Chalmers. During his  career,  Celtic reached the final again in 1970,  losing to Feyenoord,  as well as  twice contesting the semi-finals of the  Cup-Winners&#39; Cup.  Six days  after Celtic&#39;s glory in Lisbon, Rangers lost  to Bayern  Munich, after  extra-time, in the final of the Cup-Winners Cup,  the  tournament they  eventually won in 1972. Scottish clubs, then,   considered themselves  among Europe&#39;s leading teams, but the old order   has been disrupted.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s  a real different set up from what we   had,&quot; said Chalmers of the  Champions League group stages. &quot;I don&#39;t  know  if I would like the way it  is, with plenty of money and good  crowds  because they&#39;re all diving  around for tickets, or if I would  prefer it  the way we played it. There  is so much football on  television, and  you&#39;re seeing spectacular  goals, free-kicks all the  time, it&#39;s a  different game altogether now.<br><br>&quot;I  suppose you  would like to play  in it, as a forward, because the better  the  football and the better the  team, the easier it is. If you played  for a  good team, you would  appreciate it. There are so many players  moving  about now, though, that  they start to know each other, whatever  teams  they play for. It&#39;s  completely different. There weren&#39;t as many  moves  in our time. Anybody  who&#39;s sensible might say, &#39;how did you not  get to  one of those teams  like Barcelona?&#39;&quot;<br><br>Chalmers was  devoted to  Celtic, although there  was little prospect of moving abroad  in those  days anyway. In his  recently published autobiography, The  Winning  Touch, he tells of his  eventual departure to Morton in 1971,  and the  dismay of being sold by  Stein. The Celtic manager was capable  of great  insight, and there was a  formidable understanding of  psychology, but  he was also a schemer.<br><br>In  the book, Chalmers is  self-aware  enough to recognise that he never  stood up to Stein, or was  never  prepared to answer back, unlike some of  his colleagues. Despite  being  told he was leaving, he didn&#39;t challenge  the move. Stein could be  a  stern figure, even as he was urging his  players to be entertainers,   but he would have recognised the resolve in  Chalmers. The striker did   not need the same mollycoddling as Jimmy  Johnstone, for instance, but   nor was there the warmth of Stein&#39;s  relationship with Billy McNeill, or   his admiration for Bobby Murdoch.<br><br>&quot;I  had a bad period in the   early 60s, and I was nearly getting chased  off,&quot; Chalmers recalls.  &quot;But  once Jock took over, he wanted me to stay.  You can say he didn&#39;t  fancy  this player or that player, but you have to  do that as a  manager. He  got on well with the players and they got on  well with  him. I had  played more as a midfielder, but Jock decided that I  was  pacy enough to  play centre-forward.<br><br>&quot;Jock was more than  just a  manager or  just a trainer, he wanted to know everybody in the  team.  He got in with  all of us, he would have functions that you would  take  your wife with  you to, and it got everybody moving as one pack. He   took us on a  five-week tour to America. None of us would ever have been   able to go  on holiday there, and he worked it so well. That&#39;s what   pulled us  together.&quot;<br><br>The Champions League is a source of  glamour  for  Celtic, but the intrigue that it provides is of greater  value. The  form  of Neil Lennon&#39;s side in the Clydesdale Bank Premiere  League has  been  subdued, and one theory is that the absence of Rangers  has dulled  the  competitive pressure. Chalmers relished the Old Firm  encounters, and  he  is the last player to score a hat trick in a league  game between the   two sides. He, too, misses the presence of the  rivalry this season, and   wonders how it will affect his old club.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s  not going to do   anything for Celtic,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s a hard  situation. I&#39;m worried  about  how the teams will survive without the  [Old Firm] games. I can&#39;t  see  any way that it&#39;s going to be good. They  needed to be punished, but  [the  SPL clubs are] punishing themselves,  because they needed  Rangers.&quot;<br><br>The  great achievements of  Chalmers&#39; career are also  among the most  triumphant moments of  Celtic&#39;s history. Other players  left more glaring  memories, but the  quiet accumulation of distinction  is in keeping with  his character. &quot;I  got what I deserved,&quot; he says.  &quot;Football was a right  good job for  me.&quot;<br><br>The Winning Touch, by Stevie Chalmers, is published by Headline, price &pound;19.99.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <div align="center">  </div><h3>  </h3><h3>  Happy 81st Birthday to Stevie Chalmers<br></h3>By: Paul Cuddihy on 26 Dec, 2016 13:01WHILE    Christmas Day is the main focus of festive celebrations, in the    Chalmers household, Boxing Day is just as special, and today Stevie    Chalmers celebrates his 81st birthday.The Celtic legend    is one of our greatest ever goalscorers and the man who scored the most    important goal in the club&rsquo;s history, and the whole Celtic Family   wishes  Stevie a very happy birthday.Stevie scored 231   goals for  Celtic during a 12-year career with the club, making him the   fourth top  goalscorer of all-time. Only Henrik Larsson (242), Bobby   Lennox (277)  and Jimmy McGrory (468) have scored more goals for Celtic.Yet    that trio of legends can&rsquo;t claim to have score the single most    important goal in Celtic&rsquo;s history. Stevie Chalmers can. It came on    Thursday, May 25, 1967 at the Estadio Nacional in Lisbon. With just five    minutes of the European Cup final remaining, Chalmers knocked home a    Bobby Murdoch shot into the Inter Milan net to give Celtic a 2-1  victory   and ensuring they became the first club from Northern Europe  to lift   the prestigious trophy.It was the crowning  glory for the   club, the manager, the group of players he assembled  and, of course,  for  the supporters who, just two years before, had  seen their side  finish  eighth in the league. It also ensured that  Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; name  will  forever be remembered by Celtic fans.&lsquo;It  didn&rsquo;t   immediately hit me just how important that goal was when I  scored it,&rsquo;   Chalmers admitted in his autobiography, The Winning Touch.  &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t   want to think about it too much until the game&rsquo;s  finished.&rsquo;If   Lisbon was the pinnacle, then there were  many other highlights for the   forward who had made his debut as far  back as 1959. He netted a league   hat-trick against Rangers, the last  Celt to do so up to 2015; only  Bobby  Lennox in the Glasgow Cup and  Harry Hood in the League Cup have  matched  that feat. Chalmers also  scored in the 1969 Scottish Cup final,  hit  five goals in a game  against Hamilton, when Lennox also scored  five that  night, and was top  scorer in four seasons.Many   supporters have, down  through the years, visited the famous stadium in   Lisbon where history  was made, standing on the spot where Chalmers   connected with the ball,  or re-enacting that moment. Only one man did it   for real, and it  accorded him legendary status.PRELUDE TO PARADISELike    so many that had come before him, Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; pathway to  Paradise   came via the Garngad. As the area had produced the great  Jimmy  McGrory,  Chalmers had a lot to live up to but soon caught the  eye of  Celtic after  a fruitful junior career during which he turned  out for  the likes of  Kirkintilloch Rob Roy and Ashfield. His arrival  at Celtic  in the  February of 1959, coincided with the emergence of  youngsters  such as  Billy McNeill and John Clark who would soon be  joined by the  likes of  Jimmy Johnstone, John Hughes and Tommy Gemmell,  a group who  were given  the moniker of the Kelly Kids after the then  Celtic chairman  Robert  Kelly, and would form the spine of Celtic&rsquo;s  most successful  ever team.Recalling  his pre-Celtic  years, Chalmers said:  &lsquo;An early memory that I have of  Celtic which  immediately comes to mind  is as a junior player at Rob Roy.  One of our  league games had just  finished and they announced over the  tannoy  that the result from the  League Cup final was Rangers 1 Celtic 7.   There was a stunned silence  and I could hardly believe it myself. I was   a Celtic supporter, but the  club I was playing for couldn&rsquo;t be   described as &lsquo;Celtic-minded&rsquo; so I  think the result shocked a few people   that day. I still remember that  announcement as clear as day and the   looks on a few people&rsquo;s faces.  That was in 1957 and two years later, I   had joined the club myself.&rsquo;DEBUT BHOYStevie    Chalmers&rsquo; first start would see him take to the field against Partick    Thistle in the spring of 1959 where the 23-year-old&rsquo;s tireless running    soon lit up the Celtic support. Described as a raw talent in the first    team, he had all the attributes of a world-class striker, such as the    ability to set up goals as well as score them. Indeed, this attribute    and understanding of the game, allowed him to bring other players into    the game &ndash; a skill that would be greatly utilised following the  arrival   of Jock Stein.In his autobiography, Chalmers  admitted:   &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing, but it was not until my second game for  Celtic,   which took place six months after my debut, that I felt as if  I truly   arrived. A lot of that was because it was an away match,  against Fife   side Raith Rovers at Starks Park &hellip; Travelling on the bus  alongside   several Celtic greats of the 1950s, such as Bobby Evansm  Bertie Peacock   and Neilly Mochan, with them all having me on about  different things  and  having a great laugh, albeit at my expense, made  me feel great. It  made  me feel as though I was among people who really  wanted me to be  there.&lsquo;I  also scored two goals, which  always helps, in a  3-0 win. I enjoyed that  game a lot more than my  debut. I felt as  though I was much more  integrated into the scene, and  the team. It  felt, to me, like my first  real start at Celtic Park.&rsquo;HIGHLIGHTSThe   absolute  highlight for Stevie Chalmers, along with his team-mates,   came on May  25, 1967, with the European Cup triumph in Lisbon. He won a   total of 15  trophies with Celtic, and was in the team which lifted  the  Scottish Cup  in 1965, the club&rsquo;s first trophy under Jock Stein. He   scored 231 goals  for the club, and he was the last player to net a   league hat-trick  against Rangers, the treble coming on January 3, 1966   in a 5-1 derby  demolition. He was also part of the Celtic team which   swept their  Glasgow rivals aside in the 1969 Scottish Cup final to   secure a domestic  treble. Yet, for the striker, it always comes right   back to Lisbon and  that goal.Reflecting on the events of   May 1967, Chalmers  said: &lsquo;That goal has brought me nothing but   happiness; it has had  nothing other than good effects for me. It meant a   lot to my family too  in the immediate aftermath; my brothers and   sisters would go into work  and people would congratulate them on my   action. My only tinge of regret  is that my father never got to see it;   he had passed away shortly  before we got to the final in Lisbon. It   would have been lovely for him  to see that.&rsquo;LOW POINTSThe   12 years Stevie  Chalmers spent at Paradise can be characterised  around  the central  figure of Jock Stein. Prior to the manager&rsquo;s  arrival he  and Celtic had  struggled to turn their ability on the field  into  trophies, with  Chalmers often cutting a lonesome figure up  front.  Chalmers would remark  how frustrating it was to see Celtic run  like a  &lsquo;small business&rsquo; during  this time, with often only two  footballs  provided for training. There  were disappointing league  campaigns, poor  cup runs and occasional final  defeats. That would only  change with the  arrival of Stein in 1965. The  lowest point of  Chalmers&rsquo; time at  Paradise was the broken leg sustained  in the 1969  League Cup final  against St Johnstone - an injury that all  but ended  his Celtic career.BOWING OUTLike  so many  of the  Lisbon Lions, Chalmers&rsquo; time at Celtic would come to a  gradual  end as  the emergence of the Quality Street Gang soon challenged  the   first-team regulars at Paradise. As he battled back from a broken  leg,   the striker would have to contend with competition from the likes  of  Vic  Davidson, Lou Macari, and a young Kenny Dalglish for a striking    starting berth. In typical fashion though, Chalmers the hero of Lisbon    would sign off from the Bhoys in typical goal-scoring form against   Clyde  in a league encounter at Celtic Park in May 1971. It was the   Lions&rsquo;  last stand as they defeated their neighbours 6-1.Recalling    that occasion, Chalmers said: &lsquo;Celtic Park was packed that day &ndash;   Jock&rsquo;s  announcement of the final collective appearance had doubled the   crowd  for what had otherwise been something of a dead rubber &hellip; We were   5-1  ahead and the game was coursing towards its conclusion when Tommy    McCulloch, the Clyde goalkeeper, saved my shot from inside the  six-yard   box but failed to gather the ball. I followed up to put the  rebound  into  the net. It was surely fitting that the scorer of the  winner in  Lisbon  should also net the final goal for the Lions &hellip; I had  scored in  what  proved to be my final league match for Celtic, even if I  did not  know it  at the time.&rsquo;BLUE AND WHITE HOOPSStevie   Chalmers  would attempt to continue his football career as he left   Celtic by  taking up a player/coach position with Morton before finally   hanging up  his boots at Partick Thistle. During his time at Cappielow,   he was  reunited with his former Lisbon Lions team-mate, John Clark.He    said: &lsquo;When Jock sent me down to Greenock to play with Morton, I was    taking all the training with John Clark and we had to play as well,  but I   realised then I couldn&rsquo;t keep myself fit while I was trying to  keep   other people fit. I couldn&rsquo;t do the two at once and it came back  on me.   It seemed hard, but the hardest thing was leaving Celtic in the  first   place. No disrespect to Morton, but leaving Celtic Park to go  to   Cappielow was hard for me.&rsquo;FAMILY TRADITIONStevie    Chalmers&rsquo; first steps on his pathway to Paradise were influenced by    father, David, who was his idol. Having started his career at Celtic  but   not made a first-team appearance, David Chalmers would go on to  turn   out for Clydebank. It was during this time that he would take to  the   field alongside Jimmy McGrory, who was on loan at the club,  allowing the   young Chalmers to be brought up with countless stories  about the  skills  of the Celtic legend.He recalled: &lsquo;My  Father,  David, was  a professional footballer and he, very quietly, was  always  there to  help me. He taught me how to kick the ball and trap  the ball  and I  always remember that he used to take me up to  Springburn Park and  would  place the ball and try and hit the crossbar.  He was quite  accurate at it  and he encouraged me to practice and do  the same. He  played for  Clydebank, back when they were more of a  prominent senior  team and he  actually played alongside Jimmy McGrory.  My Dad was a major  influence on  my career and I had always wanted to  play football, I  never really  wanted to do anything else.&rsquo;FROM BARROWFIELD TO LISBONThe    winning goal in Lisbon may have seemed, to some observers, an    opportunistic chance by a striker inside the box. It was not. Instead,    it was the result of countless hours of practice on Celtic&rsquo;s training    ground, as Bobby Lennox explained: &lsquo;Stevie scoring the winning goal in    the European Cup final is my outstanding memory of him. It was the  type   of goal he had scored a thousand times in training, and while it  might   have looked as though Stevie just luckily got his toe to it, it  was no   surprise to any of us that Stevie had been the one to put the  ball in   the net. He was expert at knowing just how to get into the  right spot   and get that vital touch on a ball &ndash; that was the result of  years of   practice.&rsquo;HAT-TRICK HEROThere have  been very few   players to have netted a hat-trick in a derby match  against Rangers, and   each treble is remembered in its own right. When  Stevie Chalmers   achieved it on January 3, 1966, it was the first  hat-trick by a Celt   against the Ibrox club since Malky MacDonald did  so in 1938.Stevie   Chalmers said of his derby treble:  &ldquo;Scoring a hat-trick is great for a   striker but managing it against  Rangers was a wee bit special and I&rsquo;m   amazed that it hasn&rsquo;t been  repeated since then. I know there&rsquo;s been a   couple in cup competitions &ndash;  wee Bobby in the Glasgow Cup and then Harry   in the League Cup &ndash; but  it&rsquo;s been a long time in the league. It&rsquo;s   something that really stands  out because it has been so long and I&rsquo;m   quite surprised that Henrik  Larsson never managed it.&rsquo;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><div></div><div>  Happy 82nd Birthday to Stevie Chalmers<br><br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 26 Dec, 2017 10:01<br>Tweet<br><br>WHILE Christmas Day is the main focus of festive celebrations, in the Chalmers household, Boxing Day is just as special, and today Stevie Chalmers celebrates his 82nd birthday.<br><br>The Celtic legend is one of our greatest ever goalscorers and the man who scored the most important goal in the club&rsquo;s history, and the whole Celtic Family wishes Stevie a very happy birthday.<br><br>Stevie scored 231 goals for Celtic during a 12-year career with the club, making him the fourth top goalscorer of all-time.

It also ensured that Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; name will forever be remembered by Celtic fans.<br><br>&lsquo;It didn&rsquo;t immediately hit me just how important that goal was when I scored it,&rsquo; Chalmers admitted in his autobiography, The Winning Touch. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want to think about it too much until the game&rsquo;s finished.&rsquo;<br><br>If Lisbon was the pinnacle, then there were many other highlights for the forward who had made his debut as far back as 1959. He netted a league hat-trick against Rangers, the last Celt to do so up to 2015; only Bobby Lennox in the Glasgow Cup and Harry Hood in the League Cup have matched that feat. Chalmers also scored in the 1969 Scottish Cup final, hit five goals in a game against Hamilton, when Lennox also scored five that night, and was top scorer in four seasons.<br><br>Many supporters have, down through the years, visited the famous stadium in Lisbon where history was made, standing on the spot where Chalmers connected with the ball, or re-enacting that moment. Only one man did it for real, and it accorded him legendary status.<br><br>PRELUDE TO PARADISE<br>Like so many that had come before him, Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; pathway to Paradise came via the Garngad. As the area had produced the great Jimmy McGrory, Chalmers had a lot to live up to but soon caught the eye of Celtic after a fruitful junior career during which he turned out for the likes of Kirkintilloch Rob Roy and Ashfield. His arrival at Celtic in the February of 1959, coincided with the emergence of youngsters such as Billy McNeill and John Clark who would soon be joined by the likes of Jimmy Johnstone, John Hughes and Tommy Gemmell, a group who were given the moniker of the Kelly Kids after the then Celtic chairman Robert Kelly, and would form the spine of Celtic&rsquo;s most successful ever team.<br><br>Recalling his pre-Celtic years, Chalmers said: &lsquo;An early memory that I have of Celtic which immediately comes to mind is as a junior player at Rob Roy. One of our league games had just finished and they announced over the tannoy that the result from the League Cup final was Rangers 1 Celtic 7. There was a stunned silence and I could hardly believe it myself. I was a Celtic supporter, but the club I was playing for couldn&rsquo;t be described as &lsquo;Celtic-minded&rsquo; so I think the result shocked a few people that day. I still remember that announcement as clear as day and the looks on a few people&rsquo;s faces. That was in 1957 and two years later, I had joined the club myself.&rsquo;<br><br>DEBUT BHOY<br>Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; first start would see him take to the field against Partick Thistle in the spring of 1959 where the 23-year-old&rsquo;s tireless running soon lit up the Celtic support. Described as a raw talent in the first team, he had all the attributes of a world-class striker, such as the ability to set up goals as well as score them. Indeed, this attribute and understanding of the game, allowed him to bring other players into the game &ndash; a skill that would be greatly utilised following the arrival of Jock Stein.<br><br>In his autobiography, Chalmers admitted: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing, but it was not until my second game for Celtic, which took place six months after my debut, that I felt as if I truly arrived. A lot of that was because it was an away match, against Fife side Raith Rovers at Starks Park &hellip; Travelling on the bus alongside several Celtic greats of the 1950s, such as Bobby Evansm Bertie Peacock and Neilly Mochan, with them all having me on about different things and having a great laugh, albeit at my expense, made me feel great. It made me feel as though I was among people who really wanted me to be there.<br><br>&lsquo;I also scored two goals, which always helps, in a 3-0 win. I enjoyed that game a lot more than my debut. I felt as though I was much more integrated into the scene, and the team. It felt, to me, like my first real start at Celtic Park.&rsquo;<br><br>HIGHLIGHTS<br>The absolute highlight for Stevie Chalmers, along with his team-mates, came on May 25, 1967, with the European Cup triumph in Lisbon. He won a total of 15 trophies with Celtic, and was in the team which lifted the Scottish Cup in 1965, the club&rsquo;s first trophy under Jock Stein. He scored 231 goals for the club, and he was the last player to net a league hat-trick against Rangers, the treble coming on January 3, 1966 in a 5-1 derby demolition. He was also part of the Celtic team which swept their Glasgow rivals aside in the 1969 Scottish Cup final to secure a domestic treble. Yet, for the striker, it always comes right back to Lisbon and that goal.<br><br>Reflecting on the events of May 1967, Chalmers said: &lsquo;That goal has brought me nothing but happiness; it has had nothing other than good effects for me. It meant a lot to my family too in the immediate aftermath; my brothers and sisters would go into work and people would congratulate them on my action. My only tinge of regret is that my father never got to see it; he had passed away shortly before we got to the final in Lisbon. It would have been lovely for him to see that.&rsquo;<br><br>LOW POINTS<br>The 12 years Stevie Chalmers spent at Paradise can be characterised around the central figure of Jock Stein. Prior to the manager&rsquo;s arrival he and Celtic had struggled to turn their ability on the field into trophies, with Chalmers often cutting a lonesome figure up front. Chalmers would remark how frustrating it was to see Celtic run like a &lsquo;small business&rsquo; during this time, with often only two footballs provided for training. There were disappointing league campaigns, poor cup runs and occasional final defeats. That would only change with the arrival of Stein in 1965. The lowest point of Chalmers&rsquo; time at Paradise was the broken leg sustained in the 1969 League Cup final against St Johnstone - an injury that all but ended his Celtic career.<br><br>BOWING OUT<br>Like so many of the Lisbon Lions, Chalmers&rsquo; time at Celtic would come to a gradual end as the emergence of the Quality Street Gang soon challenged the first-team regulars at Paradise. As he battled back from a broken leg, the striker would have to contend with competition from the likes of Vic Davidson, Lou Macari, and a young Kenny Dalglish for a striking starting berth. In typical fashion though, Chalmers the hero of Lisbon would sign off from the Bhoys in typical goal-scoring form against Clyde in a league encounter at Celtic Park in May 1971. It was the Lions&rsquo; last stand as they defeated their neighbours 6-1.<br><br>Recalling that occasion, Chalmers said: &lsquo;Celtic Park was packed that day &ndash; Jock&rsquo;s announcement of the final collective appearance had doubled the crowd for what had otherwise been something of a dead rubber &hellip; We were 5-1 ahead and the game was coursing towards its conclusion when Tommy McCulloch, the Clyde goalkeeper, saved my shot from inside the six-yard box but failed to gather the ball. I followed up to put the rebound into the net. It was surely fitting that the scorer of the winner in Lisbon should also net the final goal for the Lions &hellip; I had scored in what proved to be my final league match for Celtic, even if I did not know it at the time.&rsquo;<br><br>BLUE AND WHITE HOOPS<br>Stevie Chalmers would attempt to continue his football career as he left Celtic by taking up a player/coach position with Morton before finally hanging up his boots at Partick Thistle. During his time at Cappielow, he was reunited with his former Lisbon Lions team-mate, John Clark.<br><br>He said: &lsquo;When Jock sent me down to Greenock to play with Morton, I was taking all the training with John Clark and we had to play as well, but I realised then I couldn&rsquo;t keep myself fit while I was trying to keep other people fit. I couldn&rsquo;t do the two at once and it came back on me. It seemed hard, but the hardest thing was leaving Celtic in the first place. No disrespect to Morton, but leaving Celtic Park to go to Cappielow was hard for me.&rsquo;<br><br>FAMILY TRADITION<br>Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; first steps on his pathway to Paradise were influenced by father, David, who was his idol. Having started his career at Celtic but not made a first-team appearance, David Chalmers would go on to turn out for Clydebank. It was during this time that he would take to the field alongside Jimmy McGrory, who was on loan at the club, allowing the young Chalmers to be brought up with countless stories about the skills of the Celtic legend.<br><br>He recalled: &lsquo;My Father, David, was a professional footballer and he, very quietly, was always there to help me. He taught me how to kick the ball and trap the ball and I always remember that he used to take me up to Springburn Park and would place the ball and try and hit the crossbar. He was quite accurate at it and he encouraged me to practice and do the same. He played for Clydebank, back when they were more of a prominent senior team and he actually played alongside Jimmy McGrory. My Dad was a major influence on my career and I had always wanted to play football, I never really wanted to do anything else.&rsquo;<br><br>FROM BARROWFIELD TO LISBON<br>The winning goal in Lisbon may have seemed, to some observers, an opportunistic chance by a striker inside the box. It was not. Instead, it was the result of countless hours of practice on Celtic&rsquo;s training ground, as Bobby Lennox explained: &lsquo;Stevie scoring the winning goal in the European Cup final is my outstanding memory of him. It was the type of goal he had scored a thousand times in training, and while it might have looked as though Stevie just luckily got his toe to it, it was no surprise to any of us that Stevie had been the one to put the ball in the net. He was expert at knowing just how to get into the right spot and get that vital touch on a ball &ndash; that was the result of years of practice.&rsquo;<br><br>HAT-TRICK HERO<br>There have been very few players to have netted a hat-trick in a derby match against Rangers, and each treble is remembered in its own right. When Stevie Chalmers achieved it on January 3, 1966, it was the first hat-trick by a Celt against the Ibrox club since Malky MacDonald did so in 1938.<br><br>Stevie Chalmers said of his derby treble: &ldquo;Scoring a hat-trick is great for a striker but managing it against Rangers was a wee bit special and I&rsquo;m amazed that it hasn&rsquo;t been repeated since then. I know there&rsquo;s been a couple in cup competitions &ndash; wee Bobby in the Glasgow Cup and then Harry in the League Cup &ndash; but it&rsquo;s been a long time in the league. It&rsquo;s something that really stands out because it has been so long and I&rsquo;m quite surprised that Henrik Larsson never managed it.&rsquo;<div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><div></div></div></div><div></div><div><h3>From Donal McCrorie on Twitter</h3><a href="https://twitter.com/grandetoro1949" target="_self">       Donald McCrorie&rlm;@<b>grandetoro1949</b></a>                      <a href="https://twitter.com/grandetoro1949/status/1122822777210273793" target="_self">2h</a></div><div><br>I am a rangers fan always have been and always will be but I will never  forget what Stevie Chalmers did for my family and my uncle Brian.  <br><br>Brian  was born with an incurable illness and wasn&#39;t expected to live past 5  years of age, he lived till he was 17, he was Celtic daft and Stevie Chalmers was his hero.  <br><br>Brian would write to Stevie every  week and Stevie rather than reply would visit him both at home in  ochiltree and in the hospital when he was going through tests and when  he was poor.

Stevie Chalmers, who has died at the age of 83, perhaps uniquely secured his legendary status through both means.<br><br>He will forever be remembered, of course, for flicking out his right boot in typically instinctive fashion to guide home the 85th-minute winner in Lisbon on 25 May 1967 which resulted in Celtic becoming the first British club to lift the European Cup.<br><br>It was, as Chalmers himself observed in later years, the &rdquo;moment that changed everything&rdquo;. Yet there was so much more to this most unassuming of men in a body of work at Celtic which stands favourable comparison with any of the club&rsquo;s most revered figures. Only three players &ndash; Jimmy McGrory, Bobby Lennox and Henrik Larsson &ndash; scored more goals for Celtic than the 231 netted by Chalmers in his 406 appearances for them from 1959 to 1971.<br><br>Like his great friend and former captain, Billy McNeill, whose own passing only last week brought such poignancy to the culmination of this season for the Scottish champions, Chalmers arrived at the club during one of the less stellar periods of their history.<br><br>But while he endured those barren seasons of the early 1960s, Chalmers was never anything less than grateful to be playing for the team he loved. The traumatic experience of contracting the potentially fatal tuberculosis meningitis when he was 20 and still playing junior football for Ashfield ensured Chalmers was fully appreciative of everything life brought him in subsequent years.<br><br>He was 22 when he made his debut for Celtic and there was an early indication of his prolific ability in front of goal when he scored 15 goals in 19 appearances in his first full season as a professional.<br><br>It was a strike-rate Chalmers would maintain on an impressively consistent basis but the silverware to match it proved elusive initially. His first major disappointment came in the 1961 Scottish Cup final, which Celtic lost 2-0 in a replay against Dunfermline, while the 3-0 loss to Rangers in the 1963 Hampden showpiece illustrated the general superiority enjoyed by the Ibrox club during that era.<br><br>The sea change in the fortunes of Chalmers and all connected with Celtic came with the arrival of Jock Stein as manager in 1965. The transformational effect extended to how Chalmers functioned as a striker,  taking his game to a new level.<br><br>While his goalscoring capacity could never be questioned, Chalmers did attract some criticism during his early years at Celtic for lacking the game intelligence necessary to make the most of his blistering pace.<br><br>It was harnessed brilliantly by the peerlessly perceptive Stein as Chalmers became the focal point of the outstanding Celtic team which dominated Scottish football and conquered Europe in the late 1960s and early 1970s.<br><br>Chalmers claimed the first winner&rsquo;s medal of his career as Celtic defeated Dunfermline 3-2 in the 1965 Scottish Cup final and was a key figure the following season when the Parkhead club became Scottish champions for the first time in 12 years.<br><br>Perhaps the most powerful indication of the balance of power in Scottish football shifting in Celtic&rsquo;s favour that season came when Chalmers struck a hat-trick in the 5-1 win over Rangers on 3 January 1966. He remained the last player to claim a treble in an Old Firm fixture until Moussa Dembele did so in another 5-1 Celtic victory in 2016.<br><br>The 1966-67 season would prove the defining one for Chalmers and the rest of the side who would become known as the Lisbon Lions.<br>James Tavernier nets from the spot.
