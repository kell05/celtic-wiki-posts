Pre-match omens were not good with McGeady, Naka,  Samaras &amp; JVoH out, a 3-0 defeat just behind us against Man U last  time, poor weather, financial gulf between the clubs etc etc.  Nevertheless, we started more spritely against Man U at home, and Skippy  scored a cracking lobbed goal which if it was scored by Man U would  have been salivated over by the commentators for weeks on end. First  half was even enough, and we could hold our heads up high. Second half  saw a more cavalier effort by Man U who bombarded our goals for the  whole 45mins, but the Celtic defence was immense, but we couldn&#39;t hold  out forever and an unfortunate parry down by THG saw Ryan Giggs snatch  an equaliser, and at the death we were lucky when Berbatov scuffed a  shot at goal. We could have ourselves earlier in the 2nd half scored a  second with a header by Sheridan, but wasn&#39;t to be. Nevertheless,  restores our pride back to an extent and onto Aalborg away next. <br><br>Also,  Ronaldo is a wee nyaff, and should have been sent off for taking a  kick-swipe at Wilson. Add in calling for a yellow card for a Celtic  player, continual diving and whinging, he really is becoming amock-villianfigure for many in football (even Man U!).<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Teams</h3><b>Celtic:- </b>  <br><a href="/page/Boruc%2C+Artur" target="_self">Boruc</a>, <br><a href="/page/Hinkel%2C+Andreas" target="_self">Hinkel</a>, <a href="/page/Caldwell%2C+Gary" target="_self">Caldwell</a>, <a href="/page/McManus%2C+Stephen" target="_self">McManus</a>, <a href="/page/Wilson%2C+Mark" target="_self">Wilson</a>,<br><a href="/page/Hartley%2C+Paul" target="_self">Hartley</a>, <a href="/page/Brown%2C+Scott" target="_self">Scott Brown</a>, <a href="/page/Robson%2C+Barry" target="_self">Robson</a>, <a href="/page/Maloney%2C+Shaun" target="_self">Maloney</a> (<a href="/page/O%27Dea%2C+Darren" target="_self">O&#39;Dea</a> 75),<br><a href="/page/McDonald%2C+Scott" target="_self">McDonald</a> (<a href="/page/Hutchinson%2C+Ben" target="_self">Hutchinson</a> 81), <a href="/page/Sheridan%2C+Cillian" target="_self">Sheridan</a> (<a href="/page/Donati%2C+Massimo" target="_self">Donati</a> 63)<br><b>Subs Not Used:-</b> <a href="/page/Brown%2C+Mark" target="_self">Mark Brown</a>, <a href="/page/Naylor%2C+Lee" target="_self">Naylor</a>, <a href="/page/Nakamura%2C+Shunsuke" target="_self">Nakamura</a>, <a href="/page/Caddis%2C+Paul" target="_self">Caddis</a>.<br><b>Goal:- </b>McDonald 13.<br><br><br><b>Manchester Utd:- </b><br>Foster, Rafael Da Silva (Evra 66), Ferdinand, Vidic, O&#39;Shea, Ronaldo, Fletcher, Carrick, Nani (Berbatov 46), Tevez (Rooney 71), Giggs.<br><b>Subs Not Used:-</b> Kuszczak, Anderson, Park, Evans.<br><b>Booked:- </b>Nani.<br><b>Goal:- </b>Giggs 84.<br><br><b>Attendance:- </b>58,903<br><b>Referee:- </b>Tom Ovrebo (Norway) <br><h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Articles </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7697254.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match Report</a> (BBC)   </li><li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/fixturesresults/round=15276/match=302738/report=rp.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UEFA</a></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Quotes</h3>&quot;Technically they are a million miles away from us, but we showed tonight that we are men.

That&#39;s what we have shown tonight,&quot; said Strachan.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;They are far better than us. Technically they are a million miles away from us but what we did show tonight was that we are men.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;We can be hard to beat because we have a great team spirit here. We may not be the best group of players in the world but we have a great spirit.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Strachan bemoaned a series of injuries that had hit his side prior to the match.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;We tried our best. The lad that came on (Ben Hutchinson) was our seventh choice striker and it was just too much for him,&quot; said Strachan.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;At the end I said we could do with some strikers coming in but we didn&#39;t have anyone so that was a problem. We needed something to kick start us tonight, either a goal or a big performance.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;We needed that quality because we were missing seven players tonight, five of who would have made the side.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Meanwhile Ryan Giggs rued Manchester United&#39;s inability to claim full points.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;With so little time to go I suppose we&#39;ll settle for draw but with the way we played and our tempo in the second half, we probably deserved to win,&quot; said Giggs. &quot;It was a disappointing first half for us but the performance in the second half was much better. We came out and worked really hard and kept them pinned down.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  &quot;We knew chances would come. We knew we just had to keep the crosses and the one-twos going, keep the tempo up and it would come.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Giggs&#39;s goal was a header from close range after Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc could only parry a Cristiano Ronaldo shot. &quot;It&#39;s always worth following up a shot like that with the ball moving all over the place,&quot; Giggs said. &quot;I just gambled and it fell right onto my head.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">  (c) 2008, The Irish Times. </div>  <div class="TailParas">  Irish Times</div>  <div class="TailParas">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <h3 class="Title">  EQUALISER SPARES THE BLUSHES OF FERGUSON; CELTIC 1 MANCHESTER UNITED 1</h3>  <div class="Provided">  <div>  06 November 2008</div>Provided by: <font color="#000099">Daily Mail</font>   </div><br><div class="LeadPara">  RYAN GIGGS came to Manchester United&#39;s rescue just when it seemed Sir Alex Ferguson&#39;s Guy Fawkes Night gamble was about to blow up in his face.</div>  <div class="LeadPara">  Ferguson left Wayne Rooney and Dimitar Berbatov on the bench, and when Celtic took the lead after 13 minutes, then followed it with a defensive show of defiance, Fergie&#39;s plans seemed to be backfiring.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  But after relentless pressure Giggs eventually saved the day when he headed home six minutes from time after Artur Boruc had failed to hold a swerving shot from Cristiano Ronaldo.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  For the Celtic fans who witnessed last night&#39;s Champions League contest here at Parkhead, this draw must lift their spirits after their comprehensive demolition at Old Trafford a fortnight ago.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  They have a fine record here in this competition. In their last 18 matches they have suffered just one defeat, and that was to Barcelona. But even their supporters considered a United victory an inevitability on this occasion, so superior were they on that last meeting.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  That, however, was before Ferguson decided he would begin preparing for Saturday&#39;s visit to Arsenal by resting key personnel for this, and before he concluded that securing a place in the last 16 of the competition was a formality.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  United&#39;s progress is now virtually assured but Celtic made life that much more difficult thanks to a terrific first-half goal from Scott McDonald.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  They might have considered themselves inferior, and in the opening 45 minutes they might have had just 38 per cent of the ball. But they used what possession they had to good effect and ultimately punished United for their arrogance. Celtic might have produced an abject performance at Old Trafford but, as they have so often proved in the past, they are a very different side here in Glasgow.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Now, United have to visit a Villarreal side who have already secured a goalless draw at Old Trafford, while Celtic travel to Aalborg in the knowledge that a win will guarantee a place in the UEFA Cup -- and could even give them an an outside chance of qualifying for the knockout phase.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Ferguson had left Rooney and Berbatov on the bench, obviously with Saturday&#39;s trip to Arsenal very much in mind. It would not have provided Celtic with that much encouragement, not when Ronaldo, Carlos Tevez and Giggs remained in the United attack, but it was something when the opposition were, in the words of Strachan, the best in the world.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Understandably, that 13th-minute opening goal carried more significance. United had started well enough, dominating possession and even threatening when Ronaldo unleashed a free-kick that flew inches over the crossbar.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  But when 18-year- old Rafael hacked down Shaun Maloney and conceded a free-kick, Celtic suddenly found themselves in front. Nemanja Vidic&#39;s headed clearance was deflected only as far as McDonald, who spotting Ben Foster well off his line and beat the United keeper with a brilliant lob.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Had Foster been caught out of position? It certainly looked that way.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  How the first goal of Celtic&#39;s Champions League campaign lifted spirits here at Parkhead. How it gave a side so comprehensively beaten in Manchester the belief that history could indeed repeat itself.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  The game changed dramatically as a result. Their confidence restored, it was Celtic who now applied the pressure and United who found themselves chasing the ball. The English champions needed to regain their composure, and fast.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  While an animated Strachan barked orders from the technical area, Ferguson nevertheless remained calm. Even when Maloney tested Foster with a dangerouslydipping shot that the Englishman actually did well to hold. It was turning into a terrific game. A contest between two teams playing fast, fluent football. Ronaldo and Tevez pressed at one end, McDonald and Cillian Sheridan at the other.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Ronaldo continued to look dangerous as he drifted between the flanks. He drove one ball across the face of Celtic&#39;s goal only to see his team-mates fail to get there, and theatened again with a testing cross from the left.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  But a Celtic defence that appeared to fragile a fortnight ago were holding firm on this occasion, much to the obvious frustration of their illustrious visitors.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  Ferguson did at least respond by replacing Nani with Berbatov at the start of the second half and slightly changed his formation. Giggs was now on the left of an attacking trio deployed to support Berbatov.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  The reshuffle so nearly produced the equaliser in the 57th minute when Berbatov pounced on a Vidic header with what looked like an unstoppable volley. But the ubiquitous Maloney was in the right place again, clearing off the line. It prompted claims from United that they had in fact scored but their protests were ignored by both Tom Henning Ovrebo and his assistants.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  While it was proving increasingly difficult for Celtic to absorb the considerable pressure they were under, they still reminded United of the threat they could pose. Sheridan went particularly close with a header in the 61st minute.</div>  <div class="TailParas">  m.lawton@dailymail.co.uk</div>  <div class="TailParas">  (c) 2008 Associated Newspapers.
