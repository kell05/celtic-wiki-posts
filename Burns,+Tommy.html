Tommy Burns was one of a very select few who was able to turn that dream into a reality.<br></font><br></font>  <div class="ds-firstpara">    </div>  <div class="va-bodytext">    <font face="Arial"><font color="#000000">Born in 1956, Tommy Burns played for the St Mary&#39;s Boys Guild before joining Eastercraig Amateurs in 1970, after which he was invited to train at Celtic Park. He signed as a schoolboy in 1970 and joined Celtic Boys Club and signed professional forms on 23 August 1973. He was then farmed out to Maryhill Juniors and later to Salisbury Callies in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) three weeks after he&#39;d made his debut on 19th April 1975. <br><br>Scottish football has known gifted players who lacked application, and hard workers whose technical ability was limited. In Burns, Celtic were fortunate to find a midfielder who was both richly talented and utterly willing to give his last ounce of energy for the cause.<br><br>He made an inauspicious debut as a substitute against Dundee as a substitute on April 19 1975 but it was not until a full year later on April 17 1976 that he made his full debut at home to Aberdeen and he made a tremendous impression in a 1-1 draw. He won rave reviews on his Old Firm debut on April 26 1976 and despite only having a handful of appearances he was reckoned to be Celtic&#39;s best player in 0-0 draw.<br><br>Jock Stein returned as manager in the summer of 1976 after his recuperation and Tommy started in the first team together with his young contemporaries George McCluskey and Roy Aitken. He stayed in the team until early winter and was in the team that lost to Aberdeen after extra time in the League Cup final of November 1976. Celtic should have won this game convincingly but a mixture of bad luck and bad finishing meant that Tommy had lost his first final. By this time the Celtic fans had taken to the youngster with the readily identifiable thick mop of red hair and the fiery temper but who had that brilliant, cultured left foot.<br><br>On Boxing day 1976 Jock Stein shocked everyone by playing Tommy at left back against Aberdeen and the young Tommy gave a good account of himself in an unusual role. He was left back again at Ibrox on March 19 1977 and played well in a 2-2 draw. Celtic had an exceptional season and the league was clinched at Easter Road when Joe Craig scored Celtic&#39;s winner. Tommy came on in the second half for Ronnie Glavin and had won his first Celtic winners medal. On May 7 1977 he was an unused substitute when Celtic lifted the Scottish Cup after a 1-0 win against Rangers.<br><br>Kenny Dalglish&#39;s departure in the summer of 1977 was the main reason for Celtic&#39;s miserable form throughout the 1977/78 season when they finished fifth in the League and could not even qualify for Europe. Despite being the tender age of 20 a lot of pressure was placed upon Tommy&#39;s shoulders and also that of the other youngsters such as Aitken, McCluskey, Sneddon and Conroy. There were bright moments none more so than the 7-1 destruction of Dundee in the Scottish Cup when Tommy opened the scoring. He excelled in the 2-1 win over SWW Innsbruck in the European Cup when he scored the winner in a 2-1 win.<br><br>Billy McNeill arrived in the summer of 1978 and immediately built his side around the younger players and also brought in the hugely influential Davie Provan and Murdo MacLeod. Celtic were making progress but were dogged by inconsistency none more than the form of Tommy Burns. He was sent off controversially for dissent in the 3-2 defeat to Rangers in the league cup semi final at Hampden in December after Rangers had been awarded a soft penalty. He had been the best player on the park at that time and it was a severe lesson for him. However, Celtic produced a late charge in the spring to win the League title in the most dramatic fashion by beating Rangers 4-2 in their final game on May 21 1979. Unfortunately Tommy missed this game through injury although he can be seen celebrating wildly in photos from after that game. Tommy was entitled to a medal as he had played 29 league games and he later rated his best ever Celtic goal as the crashing volley he scored in the 3-0 win at Tynecastle on April 18 1979.<br><br>The 1979/80 season was to be a disappointment for him mainly due to a niggling ankle injury which held him back. He had a much publicised fall out with manager McNeill in April but was recalled to the cup final side in May when Celtic beat Rangers after extra time. Tommy had a great match in midfield and missed a sitter in extra time after a great run on the break from the half way line. <br><br>The summer of 1980 was the crossroads of Tommy&#39;s Celtic career. The feeling was that he was not realising his potential and his temper had become a problem. In September 1979 he was deservedly sent off for a terrible challenge on Gordon Strachan at Pittodrie and he was becoming something of a liability. However he married Rosemary in June 1980 in St Francis church in the Gorbals where hundreds of Celtic fans turned out to cheer him. An added problem was that freedom of contract had come in that summer and with Tommy out of contract his future was uncertain. McNeill took a hard line with Tommy and Roddy MacDonald and refused to play them until both had signed a new contract. Arsenal had just lost Liam Brady to Juventus and were rumoured to be after him but nothing ever materialised.<br><br>From August 1980 Tommy Burns was like a new signing. At last there was a maturity and calmness in his play and his judgement was better especially his passing. He also became a goal threat and reached double figures by the end of the season. Some of them were spectacular efforts especially the thumping half volley against Rangers at Parkhead in August. Tommy now had found consistency and the league was deservedly won at Tannadice on April 22 1981 on an emotional night. Celtic won 3-2 with Tommy scoring a brilliant third goal by beating two men and firing a shot past Hamish McAlpine in the Dundee United goal. Tommy Burns was now on his way to be coming a Celtic great. In May 1981 he deservedly won his first cap for Scotland at Hampden against Northern Ireland.<br><br>The 1981/82 season was arguably Tommy&#39;s best in a Celtic jersey. He was now the most influential midfielder in Scotland and that is quite an accolade considering the quality of Strachan, MacMaster, Bett, Russell, Bannon and Stark who were all exceptional talents. Celtic again disappointed in the cups but excelled in the League and after Tommy had scored after 40 seconds against Airdrie in the opening game Celtic stayed top from first game to last. The League was won on the last day against Saint Mirren on a brilliant sunny day at Parkhead. Tommy was praised afterwards by going over to the disabled section of Celtic fans and giving his Celtic top to one delighted fan. It was said that quality of football Celtic were playing at that time was the best since the Lisbon Lions.<br><br>The summer of 1982 brought more uncertainty with Tommy Burns&#39; contract up for renewal. Again Arsenal were interested along with Everton. However, Tommy Burns gave everyone a huge lift by again signing on and in the late summer, early autumn of 1982 Celtic were unstoppable, racing ahead in the League and winning the League Cup in December by beating Rangers 2-1 at Hampden. On January 3 1983 Tommy scored a brilliant goal when he played one-twos with McStay and Nicholas and then sent a glorious right foot shot past the Dundee keeper. Minutes later he was injured and tried to run it off but only succeeded in aggravating the injury. This kept him out of the side for a considerable period and Celtic&#39;s form slumped allowing Dundee United to win the title.<br><br>When Billy McNeill departed in the summer of 1983 Tommy Burns&#39; form arguably never reached the heights he had previously achieved. He was still a huge influence but became more injury prone and inconsistent which was not surprising given the huge changes in personnel around this period. In the summer of 1984 Tommy came close to joining Chelsea but the London club bid only &pound;150,000 and Celtic valued him at more so the deal , thankfully, never went any further than an enquiry. New manager Davie Hay was under pressure by the end of the 1984/85 season and Celtic responded by winning the Scottish Cup against Dundee United in the most dramatic fashion. The game was a disappointment for Tommy Burns as he was taken off for Brian McClair in the second half.<br><br>At the beginning of 1985/86 Davie Hay decided to play Tommy at left back. Despite a difficult start Tommy settled to his new role and did his best. However, with Celtic struggling in February Hay reinstated Tommy Burns to the midfield and Celtic went on a great unbeaten run which culminated in them winning the title at Love Street after a 5-0 win over Saint Mirren on the day that long time leaders Hearts sensationally blew it by losing 2-0 at Dens Park.<br><br>Tommy Burns started the 1986/87 season on top form and was said to be in the running for a Scotland recall when Celtic drew the brilliant Russian side Dynamo Kiev. In the first leg at Parkhead Burns was having an inspiring game when he was badly injured by a Russian player and the major injury he suffered kept him out of the side from October until April.<br><br>Billy McNeill returned in time for the centenary season of 1987/88 and leaned heavily on the experience of Burns, Aitken and Bonner. Tommy had an emotional testimonial game against Liverpool in August 1987 when 42,000 Celtic fans turned out to salute him against old team mate Kenny Dalglish&#39;s Liverpool side. Celtic had an unforgettable season, winning the league and cup double and Tommy now had Billy Stark alongside him in midfield who went on to become a long time friend. Tommy had an inspiring game in the 2-1 win in the Scottish Cup final, again against Dundee United. <br><br>It was towards the end of the centenary season that Burns realised another long-held ambition, when he was capped against England at Wembley. Andy Roxburgh was the manager then, and Craig Brown, the assistant who would succeed him, later recalled the gratitude shown by Burns:<font face="Arial"> </font><i><br></i></font></font><blockquote><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000"><i>&quot;Before he went on to the pitch (as a substitute), Tommy stopped at the bench to thank Andy for giving him something that meant so much on a personal and a family level,&quot; Brown said. Burns, who won eight caps, later said himself that even coming off the bench to play for Scotland against England &quot;fulfilled a boyhood dream&quot;.</i></font></font><br></blockquote><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000"><br>In 1989 Tommy Burns won his last winners medal when he played in the 1-0 victory against Rangers in the Scottish Cup final. Time was running out for Tommy and he was playing less regularly by now and Celtic were having a hard time of it against a rejuvenated Rangers. McNeill had lost a lot of experience around this time and players like McAvennie, McCarthy, Aitken and McGhee were proving hard to replace.<br><br>Tommy Burns was offered a player/coach role in December 1989 from Kilmarnock and accepted it. On December 6 1989 he turned out for Celtic for the last time on a freezing cold night for a friendly match against Ajax. In the second half he was substituted and ran to the Jungle to throw his boots to the fans in a last emotional farewell gesture. Tommy Burns had gone but would never be forgotten by the Celtic supporters.<br><br>At his best Tommy Burns was a great midfield player of the mould that Scottish football used to produce, and his skill and passion for Celtic was to be a total inspiration to all who witnessed it.</font></font><br><font face="Arial"><font color="#000000"><img align="bottom" alt="Tommy Burns" height="530" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/35990293e86f0ad8907239fa44f0b4a5/GW814H530" title="Tommy Burns" width="814"></font></font><h3>    </h3>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>    </h3><h3>    </h3><h3>International player <br></h3>Tommy Burns won 8 international caps for  the Scotland senior side whilst a Celtic player. At first it seems a  paltry number, but a few things must be noted before anyone talks of  conspiracies. Tommy Burns was one of Jock&#39;s last signings as a youngster and  was later the Scotland Manager, so possibly he saw him as a wee man  rather than the adult player he was. This played against Tommy Burns when  Scotland at the time was spoilt for quality midfield players, amongst  them being Paul McStay. This at the end was likely a bigger reason  for Tommy&#39;s lack of caps under Jock Stein.   <br><br>There was hurt and  disappointment. On revealing who was to go to Spain for the World Cup,  Jock Stein entered the room full of players and announced that all were  going except Tommy Burns and one other. It wasn&#39;t the best man management from  the then waning Jock Stein, and Tommy Burns admitted it hurt him still for many  years later. Jock Stein was a great man and should have handled it  better with Tommy and told him privately at first.<br><br>Despite that, the Scotland squad was generally strong and was making the grade at regularly reaching the World Cup with a good set of players. So the Scotland management in Tommy Burns&#39; time as a player were doing well (despite certain disappointments once they got to the finals). Not easy for any player to break through into.<br>  <h3>    </h3></div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>    Manager 1994 - 1997 <br></h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" height="64" width="440"><tbody><tr><td class="                   WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%">&quot;When you pull on that jersey you&#39;re not just playing for a football club, you&#39;re playing for a people and a cause&quot;   <br><b>Tommy Burns</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Burns, Tommy - Pic" height="289" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/QJ0B1VqK9CWLSPTCLRbW7g23389/GW300H289" title="Burns, Tommy - Pic" width="300"></h3>Tommy Burns was appointed manager in 1994, in what were regarded as controversial circumstances, with allegations of tapping up by then Chief Executive Fergus McCann, leading to fines by the SFA which the press lapped up with no need for encouragement. For Tommy, it was too strong a challenge to say no. He&#39;d done well with Kilmarnock but Celtic was where his heart lay, and he was the fan&#39;s choice to take over. Alex Ferguson is said to have given a reference for Tommy to Fergus in appointing him, and so little better recommendations could have been given.   <br><br>Things didn&#39;t start off swimmingly, and the relationship with Fergus generated friction which Tommy found hard to conceal at points (even from the early days) as potential signings were missed due to the new business manner imposed by Fergus. In fairness, Fergus was correct in asking for a more measured process in transfers, but the football world was (and still is) anything but prudent, and Tommy Burns as much had to balance and work within the new confines. <br><br>The first season was difficult as Tommy Burns had to resuscitate the team and finally win Celtic a trophy (just anything to finally relieve the tension from the previous 5-6 years or so of ignominy). The league was beyond the current squad, leaving the cups as the best chances to regain some pride, and Celtic first reached the final of the League Cup against Raith Rovers, so it was all in our hands. Dramatically for Tommy Burns and the squad, Celtic lost on penalties. The saddest sight was seeing the pain etched on Tommy Burns&#39; &amp; Paul McStay&#39;s faces (the latter having missed a penalty). It was a setback despite having reached the final, and the waves of schadenfreude continued to roll on against the club. <br><br>Despite this, Tommy Burns managed to pull the squad together, and we were given a second chance in the Scottish Cup final in May up against Airdrie. The opposition hadn&#39;t exactly covered themselves in glory over recent years (over 100 yellow cards in one season), and so no one expected it to be a flowing classic. Van Hooijdonk scored the sole goal in the game, and a tense wait for all to the final whistle to see Celtic lift the cup. So Tommy Burns was off to a fair start in his first season (not dismissing the earlier hiccup). For a man like Tommy Burns, winning the Cup Final meant a lot and proved to the doubters that he was worthy of an opportunity to stop Rangers beating 9-in-a-row. However, it was to be our only trophy under Tommy Burns.<br><br>Tommy Burns&#39; second season was a difficult one. No excuses, as the transition year was over, but Rangers had too much of an advantage financially and they had the momentum from previous seasons. They were little concerned by Celtic&#39;s cup runs from the past season, and Tommy had to defeat them and drum in a winner&#39;s mentality into our squad (no easy task). The players were all behind Tommy but again it just wasn&#39;t to be. Celtic came out empty handed from the season with nothing to show unlike last and the warning signs were there, but Tommy Burns was Celtic through and through, and there were many still behind him. Celtic had only lost one game that season, so there were much good to take from the whole campaign, but still the question remained of why Celtic still couldn&#39;t win the league.<br><br>Tommy Burns&#39; last season was his last chance but this time he was better prepared. A strong squad was assembled with the arrival of Di Canio &amp; Cadete, and for the first time in a long time, confidence was high that Celtic could win the league. A good team played some great football, and there were many moments of joyful skill by the players, which allowed Tommy Burns to allow the team to play the game as he liked to see it. Sadly, this wasn&#39;t enough. Despite amassing an incredible number of points,Celtic still lost the league to Rangers. Tommy Burns stated that Goram&#39;s performances for Rangers in goals was the reason for this, but that&#39;s deflecting attention from the real truth.Celtic may have been an exciting attacking team, but a hell of a nightmare in defence to watch and blew too many easy points away with some bad defensive decisions in both tactics and personnel. <br><br>It was the end of the road for this side, and no matter how much we all respected him, it was the end for Tommy Burns as manager. Progress was not maintained, and towards the end of a disappointing third season at the helm (especially as regards results of matches v Rangers) he was offered another position at the club in charge of youth development &mdash; an effective demotion which he declined. He resigned accordingly on 2 May 1997. <br><br>Despite the disappointments, both Di Canio and Cadete, who left Celtic acrimoniously, spoke very highly of Tommy Burns venting their ire on Fergus McCann instead, and there was nobody who had a bad word personally to say about Tommy Burns as a manager despite the disappointments of the past few seasons. It just wasn&#39;t to be.<br><br>On leaving his role as manager, Tommy Burns didn&#39;t exactly cover himself in glory, doing a double page interview in a tabloid criticising the board management and seeming to be way over sanctimonious about his role at his time at Celtic against the board. It was ill-judged and uncharacteristic of Tommy Burns, and in reflection he himself will likely have regretted going ahead with it. Journalists usually take liberties and exaggerate points, and such an article so soon after departing did not give enough time for a breather and sensible reflection. It&#39;s best left till at least a year or so longer.<br><br>So what exactly was the reasoning behind his failing to win the coveted league title? Most likely it stemmed from his over-emotional attachment to the club. He was, by his very nature, an emotional person and this was as much his Achilles heel as anything else. The ability to step back and be objective is an important aspect for any management, but Tommy Burns didn&#39;t seem to be able to do this, and his lack of reticence in the goldfish bowl of Glasgow football meant he was easy pickings for the press. His cavalier approach to football meant an over emphasis in attack to the detriment of the defence, inevitably meaning that tactics weren&#39;t comprehensive enough, and for any discerning opposition manager it made their life easier in knowing how to approach to play Celtic. <br><br>Tommy Burns also had an acrimonious time with the board, but it&#39;s too simplistic to take either side alone. Celtic was going through transition everywhere (new stadium construction, new management, new board etc), so it was never going to be easy, and Tommy should have dealt with this new environment better than he did. The board can argue clearly that they supported Tommy as he was also able to spend more on players than any previous manager in Celtic&#39;s history. Probably, it was a task too far to take on the job as he admitted in part when he said after leaving: &quot;<i>I probably did 15 or 20 years as a manager in those three years.</i>&quot;<br><br>Tommy Burns was a fair manager but (sorry to say) not good enough at the end of it all. He did many things right as per the textbooks but let his heart rule his head too often. Pragmatism would have paid out more dividends in some places, and then it&#39;s possibly likely that Rangers could have been stopped. It&#39;s an irony after all that, Celtic actually did stop Rangers winning ten-in-a-row, but this was the next season under Jansen who had a weaker squad and won with less points than Tommy even amassed during his last season. In fairness, Tommy laid certain foundations that made that league victory possible, just sad that he wasn&#39;t the manager to have got that great elusive title that Celtic deserved to win.<br><br>After Celtic, he moved to work under Kenny Dalglish at Newcastle in an unsuccessful spell there, and then later moved on to an undistinguished period of management at Reading. Management didn&#39;t sadly work out for Tommy Burns in these spells, however Reading were always quick to note that Tommy was responsible for creating the set-up, especially amongst the youth, that later carried them up to the Premiership.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Scotland Assistant Manager</h3>Tommy Burns later became Assistant Manager of the Scotland national football team under Berti Vogts and retained the position under Walter Smith, where together they helped Scotland achieve some great results (beating France 1-0). However, after Walter Smiths&#39; departure from his position with Scotland, Tommy Burns left also after shabbily being ignored by the SFA for the vacant manager&#39;s position.   <br><br><h3>    Return to Celtic<br></h3>He returned to Celtic in 2005 in a third-in-charge role under Gordon Strachan (he was working with the Scotland set-up simultaneously). A position that helped to bolster Strachan who stated that working with Tommy was the best thing from his time at Celtic.   <br><br>On 29 March 2006, Celtic confirmed Burns had begun treatment for skin cancer.<br><br><h3>    Death<br></h3>On 15 May 2008, Tommy Burns passed away, RIP, a great loss to Scottish Football and to Celtic, but more importantly to his friends and family.   <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>    Summary of T Burns importance <br></h3>      <img align="right" alt="Tommy Burns - Tributes pictures - Kerrydale Street" height="495" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/EYVEJvBVIPs2v5t7G1w2pg28695/GW356H495" title="Tommy Burns - Tributes pictures - Kerrydale Street" width="356">More Than Just A Footballer.   <br><br>He was the conscience of our club, a role model for any Celt. His understanding of what made the Celtic supporters tick was fundamental in his make up simply because he was a fan himself. A fact he never ever lost sight of.<br><br>Nor would he let others who succeeded him in his beloved hoops, who were far better waged than him as a player. His insistence that Celtic players should treat the supporters with the utmost respect was ingrained in Tommy Burns. In an age of fantastic salaries, off field bonuses and unprecedented media hyperbole, the man who once took a wage cut to stay at Celtic, would have had players contractually obliged to attend supporters functions.<br><br>The Celtic support knew and understood this. That&#39;s why they filled the car park on his arrival as manager, Remarkably when he was dismissed, there was no need for a sulking side door exit (as if he would) to avoid a baying crowd, but a stroll through the front door to the welcoming love of those who wanted to comfort the man who represented their own dreams and ambitions. Results had hurt him and the supporters but the solidarity shown was reflective of the fact that they knew Tommy had, as he had done as a player, given nothing but his best for Celtic.<br><br>Tommy Burns the player was at times a joy to watch. Gloriously left sided he wasn&#39;t perhaps the most balanced, but there was a culture, thoughtfulness and no little guile in his play. Allied to the fact that he set himself, and demanded of others, the highest of standards and determination,you have the make up of Tommy Burns. But the real joy in Tommy Burns playing for Celtic, was simply playing for Celtic. Players come and go for Celtic, and indeed other clubs, and many would believe themselves sincere when they speak of the thrill of playing for the supporters.<br><br>Check out Tommy&#39;s face on any old videos when he scored for Celtic. Look at his face whenever Celtic were parading a trophy at Hampden, pure unadulterated joy. Whenever I see Celtic passing the Cup down the line at the old Hampden, Tommy was always last as he had to be dragged away from his celebrations in front of the fans. <br><br>Indeed when we won the Centenary cup final in 1988 at the final whistle he sprinted the length of the stadium to jump for joy at the Celtic end. His breathless, emotional interview shortly afterwards summed up the man. Declaring his love for his wife and children, remembering a young Celtic fan watching in hospital and finally paying tribute to the fans for their support (&quot;Because they&#39;re there and they&#39;re always there&quot;), you saw Tommy Burns as usual thinking of others before himself.<br><br>There has been some talk, of which I have been party to, about winning the league on Thursday for Tommy. On the face of it, that seems a fine and worthy sentiment. But on reflection I doubt Tommy himself would have any truck with such talk. He would have urged the players to carve out their own piece of Celtic history, to make their mark in the hearts of the supporters who will cheer them to the rafters for their efforts. Win it for Celtic, win it for yourselves and the supporters and if possible win it in style.<br><br>Today, St Mary&#39;s Chapel, Celtic Park&#39;s car park and seemingly the Gallowgate itself was an all ticket sell out for Tommy Burns. He deserved nothing less. We are so much poorer for his loss, but his life in Celtic should be an inspiration to us all. <br><br><i>(Vlad of the KStreet forum, 20th May 2008)</i><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>    Playing Career<br></h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">    <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br>(subs)</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    <b><font color="#000000">SCOTTISH CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    <b><font color="#000000">EUROPE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    <font color="#000000"><b>TOTAL</b></font></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">    1973-89</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    325 (32)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    38 (5)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    70 (1)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    34 (3)</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    467 (41)</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">    Goals: </td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    52</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    11</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    15</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    3</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">    81</td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <div align="center">    </div>    <h3>    Honours with Celtic as a player <br></h3><b>Scottish League Championship: </b>  <br><ul>  <li>    <font size="2"><a href="/page/1977" target="_self">1976-77</a>, <a href="/page/1979" target="_self">1978-79</a>, <a href="/page/1981" target="_self">1980-81</a>, <a href="/page/1982" target="_self">1981-82</a>, <a href="/page/1986" target="_self">1985-86</a>, <a href="/page/1988" target="_self">1987-88</a></font><br></li></ul><b>Scottish Cup:   <br></b>  <ul>  <li>    <font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1979-80" target="_self">1980</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1984-85" target="_self">1985</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1987-88" target="_self">1988</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1988-89" target="_self">1989</a></font><br></li></ul><b>Scottish League Cup:   <br></b>  <ul>  <li>    <font size="2"><a href="/page/1983" target="_self">1982-83</a></font><br></li></ul>  <h2>    Managerial Career<br></h2>[table required of record]   <br><br><h3>    Honours with Celtic as a manager<br></h3><b>Scottish Cup   <br></b>  <ul>  <li>    <font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1994-95" target="_self">1995</a></font><br></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>    Quotes<br></h3>&quot;[I was] the supporter who was lucky enough to get the hooped jersey to wear and become the people&#39;s representative on the park.&quot; <br><b>Tommy Burns<br></b><br>&quot;When you pull on that jersey you&#39;re not just playing for a football club, you&#39;re playing for a people and a cause&quot;   <br><b>Tommy Burns</b><br><br>&quot;When you&#39;re five and six and seven years old, as a very young person,  you have your dreams and everything.

But he was just one of those people that you just can&rsquo;t help but love. He was a helpful guy and his memory will live on within this club. Now that Tommy&rsquo;s gone, maybe all the young players Tommy has coached over the years will think about what he&rsquo;s said to them and take it on board. If they&rsquo;re intelligent enough and think about the knowledge Tommy gave them, hopefully they will take something from it.&rdquo;<br><b>DANNY McGRAIN, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b><br><br>&ldquo;HE did the right things, he looked after his diet, he worked hard at his game as he just wanted to further himself all the time. The red hair wasn&rsquo;t purely superficial as he had a wee sharp temper as well which was excellent as I like people with spirit and Tommy had spirit in abundance. But he was a good example to youngsters because he was dedicated. He didn&rsquo;t have to tell them a lot as they saw it in him and he was a well-disciplined boy off the park. He was straightforward and honest and upright with it and that was probably Tommy at his best. He treated people as he expected to be treated himself. He had a good way of talking to people and a good way of illustrating exactly what he wanted from them.&rdquo;<br><b>BILLY McNEILL, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b><br><br>&ldquo;IT was easy for me as a foreigner to feel at home when I moved to Glasgow. I learned the language very quickly and the players and the club staff made me feel very welcome.

I still find it hard to believe that he&rsquo;s not there anymore. I really just wish Rosemary and the kids all the power and strength for the future.

They must always know that Tommy was wonderful person.&rdquo;<br><b>ANDREAS THOM, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b><br><br>&ldquo;TOMMY captured the imagination of the young Celtic support. He truly was Mr Celtic and he has become such a focal point for what Celtic means to young people now. It&rsquo;s absolutely extraordinary and it&rsquo;s something from which Tommy&rsquo;s family and all of Tommy&rsquo;s friends have taken incredible strength from. I&rsquo;ve been at Tommy&rsquo;s house over the past few days and the strength that the family have received from the tributes at the ground, particularly from the Celtic support. It&rsquo;s been an absolutely incredible tribute. There are lots of other fans involved in that as we know, but Tommy has become an icon of Celtic. He himself was one of the most recognised Celtic fans.&rdquo;<br><b>CHARLIE NICHOLAS, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b><br><br>&ldquo;HE lived the dream of supporting Celtic, playing for them, coaching them and ultimately managing them and I suspect that if I asked any Celtic fan of a certain vintage what brand of football they have enjoyed most in the past 30 years, the majority would answer the type played under Tam. Tam going into management was a natural progression but he was never the type who craved a flamboyant lifestyle, out on the town eating in flash restaurants and being noticed. That was never his way. Tam would rather be at home with his wife and his family. Having said that, he also spent a great deal of time away from home on football business, much more than many other managers. He was fortunate to have a wonderful wife in Rosemary, who took care of their home and family.&rdquo;<br><b>GERRY COLLINS, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b><br><br>&ldquo;IT&#39;S hard to find the words at times like this, he was such a young age - he was only 51. Tommy and I came into the team at the same time and played for all those years together. That team during the 1970s and &lsquo;80s had great bonds. We were fans on the pitch as much as anything else and as far as Celtic Football Club was concerned, Tommy wore his heart on his sleeve. He played for the jersey and you could not find a more committed player. The number of years he gave to the club was incredible and it&rsquo;s tragic that his life has been drawn short, so unfairly. He gave everything to the club. My thoughts and prayers are with Rosemary, his children and his whole family.&rdquo;<br><b>ROY AITKEN, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)<br></b><br>&ldquo;TOMMY was a terrific gentleman. He loved Celtic Football Club to the core and he also loved his family and his faith to the core. It&rsquo;s so tragic that, less than six months ago, we were saying the same things about Phil O&rsquo;Donnell, and the similarities are there in the type of people they were. They were both great family men, they both loved their faith and they were perfect gentlemen. Everybody who spoke to Tommy, regardless of what club it was, only had admiration for him, and the character he was. There are not that many players down the years who would get that level of affection from fans and even though Tommy didn&rsquo;t succeed as a Celtic manager, most of the fans appreciated the way that he tried to play football and what he gave to the club.&rdquo;<br><b>TOM BOYD, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b> <br><br>&ldquo;THE night against Juventus (September 1981) it turned into Tommy Burns against Liam Brady and Tam won the game for us that night. He bossed that game and I&rsquo;ve never seen him in such form. He just stuck his chest out that night and decided that was his stage. He took the ball in all areas of the pitch, and I know we won trophies together but if I&rsquo;m thinking of a football memory, that was Tommy at the very top of his game that night. I remember the day we buried Johnny Doyle and we practically had to carry Tam out of the chapel that day. I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone so distraught. He was in bits that day because he had lost his wee soul mate in many ways, and I just can&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ve lost Tam early now as well.&rdquo;<br><b>DAVIE PROVAN, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008) </b><br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll miss laughing with him. The two of us learnt to text over the past two or three months and all we did was text each other every day. I couldn&rsquo;t do it before so my kids had to show me and I think he was the same, and we became experts at it. He was a supporter who&rsquo;d played for the team and had won things and enjoyed great adulation from the fans. But he actually went on to become the manager as well, and to manage and play for your team, which you thought was the greatest team in the world, must have been the greatest accolade ever.&rdquo;<br><b>GEORGE McCLUSKEY, memories of Tommy Burns (20th May 2008)</b><br><br>&quot;Tommy Burns knew what Celtic is about and represents to the Celtic Supporters because he was one of Us - Tommy epitomised everything that is great about the Celtic - the Ultimate Celtic Man&quot;. ***<br>&quot;From Soho Street to Paradise - The Calton Bhoy lived the dream&quot;.***<br>&quot;Tommy said he was &quot;a fan who got lucky&quot; - it was Celtic who got lucky Tommy&quot;.***<br>&quot;Thanks for everything Tommy - you raised the bar when it come to being a Celtic Man but even more importantly you raised the bar in being a Man&quot;***.<br>&quot;Miss You Pal&quot; - &quot;Your light shines on eternally&quot; ***<br><b>*** KDS members.</b> <br><br>  &quot;I was a Celtic supporter growing up. My first appointment was by Tommy Burns. As a human being he was incredible &amp; I learnt a lot from him.&quot;  <b><br>Brendan Rodgers (Liverpool manager, Aug 2013)</b>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>    <h3>    Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Entry<br></h3>  <div>    </div><div>  <div class="para">    <b>Burns, Thomas[Tommy]</b> (1956&ndash;2008), footballer and football manager, was born on 16 December 1956 at 43 Soho Street, Calton, in a tenement building in Glasgow&#39;s east end, the second of three children of Thomas Burns, steel erector, and his wife, Margaret,<i>n&eacute;e</i>McInnes. He had two sisters, Elizabeth and Anne. He was born in the parish of St Mary&#39;s Roman Catholic Church, in whose parochial hall Celtic Football Club was founded by a group of Irishmen led by Marist Brother Walfrid in November 1887 (with the new team playing its first game in May the following year). Burns received the sacraments of his Catholic faith there and also attended mass regularly throughout his life. Ironically, his faith was nurtured by his protestant mother as his Catholic father was often away working in the oil industry. He was educated at St Mary&#39;s Roman Catholic School in Calton, and St Mungo&#39;s Academy, run by the Marist brothers. When he was fifteen his parents separated, though his father remained supportive of his family. In the mid-1990s his aged mother converted to Catholicism.<br><br>The red-headed, left-footed Burns&#39; leisure time as a youngster was mainly spent playing and watching football, and like the rest of his family he supported Celtic. After playing with the local Catholic parish in Boys&#39; Guild football he played for Eastercraigs Boys&#39; Club, a successful youth team in Glasgow. As he began to excel on local football fields, he received offers to go to England to play professionally, but he turned these down and, despite some initial hesitation in case he did not get an opportunity to play first team football, signed in 1973 for Celtic. This meant moving to Celtic Boys&#39; Club and subsequently being farmed out to the local Maryhill Juniors side for experience.<br><br>Burns made his first appearance for Celtic under manager Jock Stein as a substitute in the 1974&ndash;5 season, but it was another two years before he made his mark as a gifted midfield player, thereafter becoming a regular until the 1989&ndash;90 season. During that time he made 503 competitive appearances and scored eighty-two goals for Celtic. In the process he won six league championships, five Scottish cups, and one league cup. He was an integral part of the team that won the league and cup double in the club&#39;s centenary year of 1987&ndash;8. Despite his winner medals, he regarded his greatest success as a Celtic player to have been his longevity at the club. After making his d&eacute;but in May 1981 he played another seven times for Scotland, the last at Wembley in the Rous cup against England in a 1&ndash;0 defeat in May 1988.<br><br>In late 1989 Burns departed Celtic for Kilmarnock. He played 167 times (scoring nineteen goals) as player and player&ndash;manager before retiring from playing in the 1993&ndash;4 season. In 1994 he returned to Celtic as manager in acrimonious circumstances since Kilmarnock did not want him to leave: the Scottish Football Association subsequently fined Celtic &pound;100,000 for &lsquo;tapping&rsquo; him and Billy Stark his assistant. As manager of Celtic from July 1994 until May 1997, he led the club in 140 matches and experienced 78 victories, 38 draws, and 24 defeats. Under his management Celtic won the Scottish cup in May 1995. This was Celtic&#39;s first trophy since Burns was a player with the team that won the same cup against Glasgow Rangers in the final of 1989. It was also the last trophy won until November 1997: these years reflecting the arduous period on and off the field experienced at the club. In the 1995&ndash;6 season Celtic lost only one league game but failed to wrest the title from a vibrant and wealthy Rangers team that won more games. Burns&#39;s time as manager of Celtic was significantly tempered by the presence of Fergus McCann, the Scottish-born, Canadian-based owner of the club from 1994 to 1999. McCann and Burns did not have a good relationship, with Burns solely focused on a successful Celtic team and McCann emphasizing stadium redevelopment, a sound financial footing for the club, and making a large profit from his venture. Eventually Burns was sacked, three weeks before the end of the 1996&ndash;7 season. McCann&#39;s tenure deeply divided fans but Burns retained the Celtic supporters&#39; affections, recognizing as they did that he was one of them and that he knew what Celtic meant in Catholic/Christian, Irish, moral, and marginalized class terms. Burns modestly wrote that he was &lsquo;the supporter who was lucky enough to get the hooped jersey to wear and become the people&#39;s representative on the park&rsquo; (Burns, 144). Likewise he once said of his beloved club: &lsquo;When you pull on that jersey you&#39;re not just playing for a football club, you&#39;re playing for a people and a cause&rsquo; (Cuddihy, 1).<br><br>Burns subsequently encountered another turbulent time in a football club&#39;s history when after a short spell assisting Kenny Dalglish at Newcastle, he temporarily and unsuccessfully managed Reading between March 1998 and October 1999, during which time the team was demoted from the first to the second division of English football. He returned to Celtic to assist temporary manager Dalglish in early 2000 and was subsequently put in charge of youth development by new manager Martin O&#39;Neill in June of that year. Aware that a club of Celtic&#39;s stature required a modern training facility&mdash;as opposed to the one traditionally used by the club at Barrowfield near to Celtic Park&mdash;he was instrumental in achieving this at Lennoxtown near the Campsie Hills. While still head of youth development at Celtic, he also assisted Bertie Vogts in his position as Scotland manager from March 2002 to November 2004. He subsequently managed Scotland for one match, against Sweden, before the appointment of his former Glasgow Rangers managerial rival, Walter Smith (assisted by former Rangers player Ally McCoist), as manager. He continued in his supportive role with Scotland until Smith left the post in 2007.<br><br>Burns married Rosemary Smith, a computer operator, and daughter of Matthew Hendry Smith, builder&#39;s labourer, on 24 June 1980 (Rosemary&#39;s twenty-fifth birthday) at St Francis&#39;s Roman Catholic Church in Glasgow&#39;s Gorbals district. Hundreds of children and adults surrounded the wedding party as it left the church, greeting them with Irish and Celtic flags and singing the Celtic club anthem, &lsquo;Hail Hail, the Celts are here&rsquo;. The Burns family subsequently comprised Tommy, Rosemary, and four children, Emma, Jenna, Michael, and Jonathan.<br><br>Reflecting his personal faith and the founding ethos of the club he represented for most of his life, Burns organized and attended many hundreds of charitable events and as a talented singer, as well as a genuinely humorous individual, he was often requested to sing the Bobby Darin classic, &lsquo;Mack the Knife&rsquo;. He would almost always enthusiastically comply and such a rendition was usually forthcoming at the annual &lsquo;Burns Night Supper&rsquo; (dedicated to Tommy not Robert) held by the Heriot-Watt and Edinburgh universities Celtic Supporters&#39; Club.<br><br>Burns was diagnosed with skin cancer in July 2005, and despite treatment he died at his family home, in Newton Mearns, on 15 May 2008, shortly after a visit to the Catholic Marian shrine at Lourdes. His requiem mass was concelebrated by forty-one priests, including two bishops, at St Mary&#39;s Roman Catholic Church in Calton on 20 May 2008. A reported 20,000 people attended his funeral at the church and in the vicinity of the parish and Celtic Park. He was buried in Linn cemetery, Castlemilk, Glasgow, and was survived by his wife, Rosemary, and their four children.<br><br>Joseph M.
