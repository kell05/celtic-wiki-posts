The  Rogic goal at Killie was incredible. It&#39;s a lot like today. Ronny does  icing, but his cakes are dreadful.<br><br>So, the main reason I&#39;ve made  it to eff all games this season is I&#39;ve one son who&#39;s just turned two  and another who&#39;s 3 months. The older one and I have had a lot of fun  playing football in the garden lately and there was an incident during  the Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony when he waved his manhood at The  Queen...<br><br>I&#39;ve been trying to work out when&#39;s the best time to  take a kid to the football, so I took the older one along to a reserve  game at St Mirren a month ago. He paid attention for about fifteen  minutes, then understandably got bored and demanded to wander about, so  we went home.<br><br><br>My Dad decided he didn&#39;t want to use his  concession season ticket today, so I told him I&#39;d take it and let the  wee man come along for the last bit of the game. After him brow beating  me for ages about what a daft and irresponsible thing it was to do and  what if this and that might happen and God forbid he might need a poo, I  eventually decided to take him.<br><br>We watched the first half on TV  then jumped in the motor and parked up by the Emirates Arena. Walked up  by the Motherwell fans already getting on their bus.<br><br>Got into the  ground and took the lift up to the upper tier. Was interesting that the  wee guy was a bit reluctant to walk into the light and noise, but once  he was there it was fantastic.<br><br>Walked down and took our seats at  70 minutes. Little bloke spent a lot of time looking around, but  essentially took to copying everyone else by cheering and standing up to  clap.<br><br>I&#39;ll always remember that last goal.

Picture: SNS<br>Celtic&#39;s Kieran Tierney celebrates his goal. Picture: SNS<br><br>There were seven different goalscorers in a display of power, precision and purpose from Celtic. It was also a day when a little piece of history was made as Jack Aitchison &ndash; just 16 years and 71 days old &ndash; became Celtic&rsquo;s youngest player and scorer when he came off the bench to net with his first touch of the ball.<br><br>It was an enticing glimpse of the future for Celtic, a future which will not involve Deila. But it set the seal on a performance which allowed him to leave the club with his head held high, which was the least he deserved.<br><br>Having formed a pre-match guard of honour to applaud Celtic on to the pitch, Motherwell were simply played off it.<br><br>Before goalkeeper Connor Ripley&rsquo;s afternoon turned horribly sour, it was only his early exertions which prevented the hosts making the breakthrough sooner than they did.<br>Home fans unveil a banner at Celtic Park. Picture: Danny Lawson/PA<br>Home fans unveil a banner at Celtic Park. Picture: Danny Lawson/PA<br><br>Moving the ball with pace and invention in the attacking third of the pitch, Celtic created a succession of clear-cut openings. Tom Rogic shot tamely straight at Ripley in the seventh minute, then the goalkeeper reacted smartly to keep out a close-range effort from Ryan Christie who was the surprise replacement up front for suspended top-scorer Leigh Griffiths.<br><br>Ripley then made a magnificent, leaping save to touch over a dipping 20-yard shot from Rogic and maintained his level of defiance when he smothered another attempt by Christie, who had been sent clean through by Mikael Lustig. But Ripley had no answer to Celtic&rsquo;s 21st minute opener which provided a moment to cherish for Kieran Tierney. Scotland&rsquo;s Young Player of the Year, whose impressive emergence this season is one of the most positive legacies of Deila&rsquo;s time in charge, cut in from the left before burying a low right-foot shot beyond Ripley into the corner of the net.<br><br>It was the prompt for a meltdown in the Motherwell backline as Celtic trebled their lead within another eight minutes.<br><br>Rogic made it 2-0, tapping his tenth goal of the season into an empty net after Stuart Armstrong had struck a post after playing an incisive one-two with Christie on the edge of the penalty area.<br>Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates. Picture: SNS<br>Celtic manager Ronny Deila celebrates. Picture: SNS<br><br>Ripley, now looking as rattled as he had appeared assured earlier, then allowed a Rogic cross-***-shot to squirm under his body, his blushes spared this time by Marvin Johnson&rsquo;s clearance off the line.<br><br>But there was nowhere for Ripley to hide when Celtic added their third goal in the 29th minute. He completely misjudged Armstrong&rsquo;s inswinging corner from the left, presenting Lustig with a free header which the Celtic captain powered home from close range.<br><br>It should have been even worse for Motherwell before half-time as Christie contrived to perpetrate one of the misses of the season. Left with an open goal after Ripley had parried a Rogic shot, he screwed his shot off target from around six yards out.<br><br>McGhee made a double substitution at the start of the second half, replacing Luke Watt and Lionel Ainsworth with Joe Chalmers and Kieran Kennedy, but there was no respite for his side as Celtic continued to cut through them relentlessly.<br><br>Armstrong made it 4-0 six minutes after the restart, taking one touch to control a Lustig cross on the edge of the penalty area before smashing a superb right-foot shot high beyond Ripley&rsquo;s right-hand into the roof of the net.<br><br>The final whistle simply couldn&rsquo;t come quickly enough for Motherwell but there was further pain for them to endure before they could slink away for their summer break.<br><br>Patrick Roberts scored what is becoming a trademark goal for the on-loan Manchester City winger, drifting in from the right and spearing a low left-foot shot into the far corner of the net for Celtic&rsquo;s fifth of the afternoon.<br><br>Number six followed in short order, Christie atoning for his first-half howler as he scored his first goal for the club, finishing neatly from around 16 yards after being set up by Rogic.<br><br>If this was the stuff of nightmares for the visitors, it was dream come true material for young Aitchison as he made his stunning entrance into the Celtic history books. Just three minutes after replacing Rogic, he made it 7-0 with a coolly taken goal as he latched on to Christie&rsquo;s pass and guiding a left-foot shot beyond Ripley. He eclipses both Mark Fotheringham as Celtic&rsquo;s youngest first-team player and Paul McStay as their youngest goalscorer.<br><br>Craig Gordon&rsquo;s presence proved not completely unnecessary for Celtic, the &lsquo;keeper finally making his only save of the day to deny Morgaro Gomis a late consolation for the  visitors.<br><br>Read more: http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/celtic-7-0-motherwell-ronny-deila-s-last-game-is-seventh-heaven-1-4128590#ixzz48nYzhQvX<br>Follow us: @TheScotsman on Twitter | TheScotsmanNewspaper on Facebook<br>  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  Celtic 7-0 Motherwell: Ronny Deila celebrates &#39;fantastic&#39; send-off<br><br> From the section Football <br><br>Ronny Deila celebrates with the Scottish Premiership trophy<br>Deila won successive league titles, but couldn&#39;t inspire an overall improvement in performances<br><br>Ronny Deila admitted his final game as Celtic manager &quot;couldn&#39;t be better&quot; as the Scottish Premiership champions celebrated by routing Motherwell 7-0.<br><br>The Norwegian&#39;s farewell brought goals from six players aged 24 or under, including 16-year-old Jack Aitchison.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s an emotional day, a fantastic day in every way,&quot; he told BBC Scotland. &quot;We played very, very well with a very young team and scored seven goals.<br><br>&quot;There is so much talent here and these guys can be great in the future.&quot;<br><br>Left-back Kieran Tierney, 18, celebrated his first goal for the club on his 33rd appearance of an outstanding debut season that also included a first outing for Scotland.<br><br>Patrick Roberts, 19, curled in his fourth goal in as many matches, while Ryan Christie, 21, was also on the scoresheet in only his sixth game under Deila since returning from a loan spell at former club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.<br><br>But the highlight was a goal with his first touch from Aitchison, who at 16 years and 71 days became the youngest player to represent Celtic in a competitive match.<br>Jack Aitchison celebrates his debut goal with his first touch<br>Aitchison overtook Mark Fotheringham as Celtic&#39;s youngest-ever player, scoring with his first touch<br><br>&quot;The academy is a very important part of this club,&quot; Deila noted. &quot;They have done a very good job.<br><br>&quot;It is so good to get the youngsters on the pitch and for them to perform so well.&quot;<br>&#39;I didn&#39;t know what to do when I scored&#39;<br>Departing Celtic manager Ronny Deila<br>Jump media player<br>Media player help<br>Out of media player.
