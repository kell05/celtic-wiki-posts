However, being that the Kerins  family was of farming stock, it is safe to assume that they would not be  left untouched by tragedy.<br> <br>A consequence of the Great Famine,  Ireland&#39;s rural population fled the countryside to the towns and cities  where, in Ireland, the disaster was no less biblical in its proportions.  The result was an exodus of Irish folk to mainland Britain (and some  also to The New World), and specifically the cities of the Industrial  Revolution - notably, Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester, London, Edinburgh  and Dundee.<br><br>Awaiting them was work, albeit poorly paid, menial  and unskilled, and, of course, slum living conditions, disease and  terrible, unimaginable deprivation.<br><br>Sadly, the establishment, the  ruling classes, the Government and the Protestant Churches of Scotland  and England did more than their fair share to alienate the Irish  immigrants, who were seen to be and treated as though they were less  than human. Glasgow was no exception to the British rule, as the Irish  and <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a> would discover.<br><br>Brother  Walfrid had taken his religious name, as was the practice of the Marist  Order, to signify the cutting of all ties with &#39;life in the world&#39;, but  he would remain a man that was haunted by that which he had witnessed  in Ireland. It was a horrific reality that would not be exorcised  amongst the grotesque slums of Glasgow&#39;s East End, where Brother Walfrid  arrived in the early 1870s.<br><br>The squalor, deprivation, poverty,  decay, disease and human suffering of the &#39;Empire&#39;s Second City&#39; - the  most densely populated city in Europe, at that time - can scarcely be  imagined by us today. The bold attempts by modern day film- makers to  depict the full extent of the horror of the impoverished population of  industrialised, Victorian Britain are woefully inadequate; as are the  televised works of Dickens, where the children are rosy-cheeked and  cherub-like and not, as they should be in the interests of historical  accuracy, scarred by disease, waif-like, filthy dirty, dressed in rags  and clinging barely to life.<br><br>However, the statistics are graphic  enough. Of the 11,675 registered deaths (and that is registered - there  would be many more) in Glasgow in <a href="/page/1888" target="_self">1888</a>,  4,750 were children under five years of age. It was a nightmare best  not revisited, or even contemplated, though there are, sadly and  shamefully, modern equivalents yet remaining on this Earth.<br><br>This, then, was the gruesome world that Brother Walfrid devoted his life in Glasgow to combating.<br><br>Brother  Walfrid worked like a man possessed, with zeal and enthusiasm,  compassion and care, kindness and courage, dedication and energetic  vigour in this wretched environment of despair and pain. As a teacher at  St Mary&#39;s and then as headmaster at Sacred Heart School in Bridgeton,  Brother Walfrid witnessed at first hand the full extent of the plight of  the poor, the needy, the starving and the suffering.<br><br>The  children of this misery were, however, his prime concern. Aside from  educating the children of the slums, Brother Walfrid also sought to feed  and clothe them. To do so, he was instrumental in establishing, in  1884, the &#39;Penny Dinners&#39; for his poverty-stricken pupils and the  children of his parish.<br><br>In order to achieve this aim, Brother  Walfrid had enlisted the aid of the St Vincent de Paul Society, itself  introduced into the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1848. <br><br>Thereby, <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a>  attempted to ensure that his children received a warm and nourishing  meal each day for their penny. In Walfrid&#39;s very own words:<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%">&#39;Should  parents prefer, they could send the bread and the children could get a  large bowl of broth or soup for a halfpenny, and those who were not able  to pay got a substantial meal free. This has been a very great blessing  for the poor children.&#39;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>However, two  separate events dictated to the devout and compassionate Walfrid that  his efforts, and those of his Marist colleague, assistant and headmaster  of St Mary&#39;s, Brother Dorotheus, were wholly insufficient.<br><br>Firstly,  the activities of the Presbyterians were a great concern, given that  the Protestant Church was also active in feeding and attending to the  poor of the East End, while simultaneously trying to &#39;snare away&#39;  Brother Walfrid&#39;s flock. Brother Walfrid enjoyed a close and warm  relationship with his Protestant cousins, but he was also fearful of  tactics that he&#39;d witnessed in his homeland, Ireland, of turning the  poor against the Catholic Church.<br><br>Secondly, poverty was worsening  - dramatically and horrifically so. Brother Walfrid needed to do more  and find a focus for the community to stand together behind.<br><br>Arguably, there were four main ingredients that had to be introduced into the embryonic idea of Celtic:<br>- charity (to feed and clothe the East End&#39;s poverty- stricken), <br>-  religion (to assist the Catholic Church in fighting off the advances of  Protestantism recruitment, when people were at their most vulnerable  and therefore most amenable to targeting for recruitment by  missionaries, and also of course to cement the relationship of trust,  compassion and caring between the Catholic Church and its flock), <br>- culture (to provide a much needed focus, identity and symbol for the Irish Catholic population of Glasgow) <br>- and, of course, politics.<br><br>The  charitable aspirations and intentions of Brother Walfrid and Brother  Dorotheus are well established. Others would become involved with this  philanthropy.<br><br>Undoubtedly, Walfrid was also aware of the  ever-increasing influence of the Protestant Church in Glasgow&#39;s East End  and of the dangers that entailed, as far as he and the Archdiocese of  Glasgow were concerned. He would also have been alarmed at the extremes  of anti-Catholic prejudice within the endemic Scottish community and  also within the Protestant Church - ironic, given its simultaneous  benevolence towards the Irish Catholics of the East End - and also the  gradual rise of Orange-ism in Glasgow.<br><br>However, it is less well  recorded that some of the &#39;official&#39; Presbyterian anti-Catholic doctrine  was, in effect, a defence mechanism to deflect attention from the  schisms within Presbyterianism itself, at that time. Anti-Catholicism  was all that united a divided Protestantism. Brother Walfrid said:  &#39;&#39;Twas the most dangersome time for the young fellos, jest afther they  had left school, an&#39; begun t&#39; mix up wid Protestand boys in the places  where they wor workin&#39;.&#39;<br><br>Culturally, <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a>  would also have seen the need to provide his Irish Catholic flock with a  focus, an identity and a symbol, away from the Church. This symbolism  of pride and achievement and Irish-ness already had a template - it was  called Edinburgh <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibernian</a>.<br><br>Founded  in 1875 by Canon Edward Hannan, Edinburgh Hibernian had become, not  only a successful football club in its own right, but also a symbol for  the Irish throughout Scotland. Hibernian was, however, run exclusively  for the Catholic Irish and was greatly influenced by the temperance  movement of the age - the demon drink being seen by many as the cause of  so many evils in society.<br><br>Brother Walfrid would learn much from  Edinburgh Hibernian and would also, in time, be both inspired by  Hibernian and disregarding of its template for his own vision.<br><br><h3>Politics</h3>The  political opinions of Brother Walfrid will forever remain a secret.  What cannot be denied, however, are the politics of those that  surrounded the Marist priest. Ireland and Britain were hotbeds of  political ideologies in the 19th Century, and these ideologies would  impact on the embryonic concept of a <a href="/page/Celtic+Football+Club" target="_self">Celtic Football Club</a>.  Indeed, had they not done so, our Club may not have survived, falling  by the wayside like so many others, and our Club may not have been born  with the genetics for equality, liberty, fraternity, integration and  non-sectarianism at is very core.<br><br>Walfrid surrounded himself with  men who were the driving forces behind many of these political  ideologies - men such as John Glass, Pat Welsh, Dr. John Conway, James  Quillan, William McKillop, John O&#39;Hara, Thomas Flood, J.M. Nellis,  Joseph Shaughnessy and Hugh and Arthur Murphy. Brother Walfrid would  also have connections with John Ferguson and Michael Davitt. It must be  assumed that he did so by choice. It was a wise choice, indeed.<br><br>Brother  Walfrid had, through his charitable, teaching and ecumenical  activities, collated a considerable database of contacts, colleagues,  friends and acquaintances, many of whom would be of sterling use in the  founding of Celtic; each would bring his own unique attributes to the  table of creation. Indeed, <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a> was later described by Tom Maley, former Celtic player, <a href="/page/Celtic+committee" target="_self">Celtic committee</a> man and brother of then Celtic manager, <a href="/page/Maley%2C+Willie" target="_self">Willie Maley</a>,  as: &#39;A wonderful, organising power... of lovable nature&#39; and a man who  &#39;only had to knock, and it was opened.&#39; Admirable qualities, and they  would be very useful in the art of persuasion, when it was necessary.<br><br>Of  course, the fact that Brother Walfrid was both respected and revered  throughout Glasgow, for his charitable works and devotion to the poor,  would also be an undeniable attraction for assistance. Each of the men  that Brother Walfrid associated with in the formation of the fledgling  Celtic concept were philanthropists, successful men in their own fields  of expertise and, crucially, they were politically active to varying  degrees.<br><br>Political astuteness would be fundamental for the  choices that lay ahead. Had they not chosen the path that they did, the  longevity and success of Celtic would have been compromised from the  beginning.<br><br>Patrick Welsh, for instance, had been, in Ireland, a  Fenian activist. For weeks in 1867, Welsh had been on the run from the  British authorities, but was apprehended by a 37- year old British  soldier - Sergeant Thomas Maley of the Royal North British Fusiliers -  at Dublin quay, as Welsh was attempting to flee his country of birth for  the prospect of a new and peaceful life in Scotland. Fortunately for  Welsh, whose fate might have been imprisonment or the gallows, Sergeant  Maley was an Irish Catholic who had wrestled with his conscience while  serving Queen Victoria in Ireland. Also fortunately for Pat Welsh, there  were no other witnesses to his capture.<br><br>Sergeant Maley, whose  third son, Willie, would be born the next year, demanded that Welsh  would not break their own peace treaty and Maley allowed the eternally  grateful Pat Welsh to escape to Scotland. Pat Welsh would become a  master tailor with premises on fashionable Buchanan Street, Glasgow,  where he would prosper both as a businessman and as a family man. He  kept his word to Sergeant Maley and, in the years to come, recognising  that Maley could have faced court-martial for his act, Pat Welsh  remained firm friends with Thomas Maley when the soldier retired from  the British Army and moved to Cathcart village, near Glasgow, with his  Scottish wife and their four sons, Charles, Tom, Willie and Alec.<br><br>This  was, also, a twist of fate that would hugely benefit Celtic. Sergeant  Maley&#39;s second son, Tom, would play for Celtic and would also become a <a href="/page/Celtic+committee" target="_self">Celtic committee</a>  man. Willie would do likewise, though Willie is also known as &#39;Mr  Celtic&#39; for what he achieved for the Club over a fifty-year period. And  all because of a selfless act of humanitarianism!<br><br>The name of  John Glass repeats itself throughout research into the creation of  Celtic. Undoubtedly, Brother Walfrid was the architect, the instigator,  the motivator and the conduit to all the facets that would come  together. John Glass, however, was the master builder and the catalyst  for it all to happen.<br><br>His importance should be recognised. John  Glass was a joiner, a man with many contacts in the building trade and a  son of Donegal. He was also, we are told, a man that could &#39;charm the  birds down from the trees&#39; such was his charisma. This charm and  persuasiveness would be a highly useful tool in Celtic&#39;s formation, as  Glass is widely acknowledged to be the man who persuaded a number of  famous football <a href="/page/players" target="_self">players</a>  of the time to join the fledgling Club. A humanitarian and a meticulous  organiser, Glass was also a leader of men, and specifically a dignified  and highly respected leader of the Irish Catholic community. John Glass  was THE politician sitting at the round table deliberating the creation  of Celtic. Glass was later described by <a href="/page/Maley%2C+Willie" target="_self">Willie Maley</a> as the man &#39;to whom the Club owes its existence.&#39;<br><br>Ferguson  and Glass organised several political rallies at which Michael Davitt  addressed the Highland crofters. The question must therefore be asked:  did the name &#39;Celtic&#39; originate from this popular political influence of  the day, and did Brother Walfrid and John Glass see in this name a  method to celebrate Irish-ness, symbolise Irish-ness, yet simultaneously  join hands with Scottish Celts? After all, historically speaking, the  peoples of Ireland and Scotland were one and the same - Celts!<br><br>The Irish and the Scots working classes had two things in common: the mutual fight for survival and a love of football. <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a>  had, for some time, been aware of the profound popularity of the sport  of football. Indeed, he had himself organised many games to provide  funds for the &#39;Penny Dinners&#39;, and with considerable success too.<br><br>Edinburgh <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibernian</a>  was the team that his Irish Catholic flock was more than happy to pay  to see, and Brother Walfrid recognised both this and the fact that  Edinburgh Hibernian had become a symbol of Irish-ness, culture, religion  and success in Scotland. It was a potent and powerful mix that Brother  Walfrid would soon learn could be harnessed for a multitude of community  benefits.<br><br>On February 12th <a href="/page/1887" target="_self">1887</a>, Edinburgh Hibernian won the <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup" target="_self">Scottish Cup</a>,  the country&#39;s premier and most coveted trophy, by defeating Dumbarton  2:1 at Hampden Park, Glasgow. The triumph was celebrated joyously by  Irishmen throughout Scotland and, indeed, the scenes of jubilation in  Glasgow were a match for those in Leith, Edinburgh.<br><br>This, then,  was the power of football and also the symbolism of success for the  Irish community. Edinburgh Hibernian were feted as the victors by  Glasgow&#39;s Irish and the triumphant team was taken to St Mary&#39;s Hall in  the Calton district of Glasgow to receive the spoils of jubilant  victory. Amongst the rapturous throng were Brother Walfrid and John  Glass. Dr John Conway led the speeches in praise of Edinburgh Hibernian,  the gathering sang &#39;God Save Ireland&#39; and John McFadden, the  Hibernian&#39;s secretary, was so moved by the warmth of the reception and  the fervour of the hospitality that he, perhaps jokingly, suggested that  his hosts should &#39;go and do likewise&#39;!<br><br>Brother Walfrid accepted  the gauntlet of the challenge. After all, if Edinburgh could produce a  successful Irish football team then surely Glasgow could do likewise,  given the far greater Irish population in Glasgow.<br><br>As an  indication of the margins between longevity of life for a fledgling  football club and inauspicious demise in a pauper&#39;s grave, one needs  only look at the names of the clubs that registered with the Scottish  Football Association on August 21st <a href="/page/1888" target="_self">1888</a>: Celtic Football and Athletic Club, Champfleurie and Adventurers  of Edinburgh, Leith Harp, Balaclava Rangers from Oban, Temperance  Athletic of Glasgow, Whifflet Shamrock and Britannia of Auchinleck.  Brother Walfrid and his associates would come to ponder the mechanics  required for a successful launch and, of course, a sustainable flight.<br><br>The  objectives were, however, clear enough: the funding of charities in  Glasgow&#39;s East End, notably Brother Walfrid&#39;s &#39;Penny Dinners&#39;; a focus,  an identity, a symbolism for the Irish Catholic population where a  successful football club could and would sustain the morale of an  otherwise frequently demoralised people; a route to health and fitness  for the young men of the area and a method to keep them distracted from  alcohol; a way to combat, through self-finance, the influence of the  Presbyterians in the East End and, perhaps most importantly of all, a  symbol of hope when around them there was so much despair. But, how?<br><br><h3>The Club is formed</h3>On the afternoon of Sunday November 6th, <a href="/page/1887" target="_self">1887</a>,  a meeting to constitute the formation of the Celtic Football  and Athletic Club was called to order by John Glass. Through arduous  discussions and, at times, heated debates, the pivotal and crucial  decisions had been made that would cement the structure of Celtic. The  choices were wise, indeed. Initially, the local parishes of St. Mary&#39;s,  St Andrew&#39;s and St Alphonsus&#39; had been involved, but the &#39;mother parish&#39;  of St Mary&#39;s had been the driving force and, consequently, some  disgruntled individuals departed the scene, no doubt disillusioned by  the abandonment of the principles of the template for such a venture,  Edinburgh <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibernian</a>.<br><br>Edinburgh  Hibernian was an organisation with the temperance movement at its core.  Celtic was not to be that. Brother Walfrid, John Glass, Pat Welsh et al  would realise the fundamental importance of Celtic being managed with  business acumen and financial expertise in order to survive and sustain  itself during what could be a troubled birth, a precarious childhood and  even a fraught adolescence.<br><br>Only adulthood - a long way off -  would provide a modicum of comfort. So, why exclude the monies of the  License Trade when that money could be used for the benefit of the Club?  And, with such a partnership (albeit with the demon drink), immediate  funds and employment (although, in some cases in name only) could be  found to attract football <a href="/page/players" target="_self">players</a> to Celtic - all amateurs, of course, though their expenses would not fool even the most average of accountants!<br><br>Edinburgh  Hibernian also operated a Catholic only employment policy. This  exclusivity would be disregarded by the founding fathers of Celtic - a  bold and courageous move, given the prejudices of the era, and one that  would be embraced for ever more by Celtic.<br><br><a href="/page/Maley%2C+Willie" target="_self">Willie Maley</a>,  Celtic&#39;s manager for over forty years, summarised this fundamental of a  non-sectarian Celtic when he later said: &#39;It is not his creed nor his  nationality which counts -it&#39;s the man himself.&#39;<br><br>Indeed, Maley  would openly boast of the Protestants, Hindus, Jews and Muslims that had  been - and were - in the employ of Celtic, though in reality the Club  was, at its roots, Catholic and Irish, proudly and justifiably so. This  non-sectarian fundamentalism had the fingerprints of John Glass&#39;  politics all over it and, in fact, was the principle that set Celtic  apart, from the outset. When one considers the undeniable temptation to  be exclusivist in the face of such provocation - prejudice and bigotry  were the norm - it was a brave, indeed socialist and humanitarian, move  and one that paved the way for the likes of <a href="/page/Thomson%2C+John+%281926-31%29" target="_self">John Thomson</a>, <font color="#333333"><a href="/page/Stein%2C+Jock" target="_self">Jock Stein</a></font>, <a href="/page/McGrain%2C+Danny" target="_self">Danny McGrain</a>, Kenny Dalglish and, yes, Henrik Larsson, not to mention the non-Catholic Tims that would be attracted to the Celtic Cause.<br><br>Of  course, there were voices of dissent and attempts were made to rewrite  Celtic&#39;s constitution so that &#39;only the right sort&#39; could be employed by  and play for Celtic. Such malcontents were especially evident when, in <a href="/page/1897" target="_self">1897</a>, Celtic became &#39;Celtic Football and Athletic Company Limited&#39;. One such breakaway formed the short-lived Glasgow <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibernian</a>. The dissenters lost, however, and Celtic is culturally wealthier as a result.<br><br>The  options for the christening ceremony for Celtic were considerable and  numerous, but somewhere along the line, Brother Walfrid, perhaps  inspired by Glass, insisted that the name should be Celtic.<br><br>But, Seltic or Keltic?<br><br>Most scholars believe that <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a>  preferred the Keltic pronunciation, but the &#39;soft C&#39; was adopted.  Whatever the minutiae, the choice of name was inspired and one ponders  whether the impact of our Club would have been quite the same had &#39;she&#39;  been christened Erin, Hibernian, Shamrock or Emerald? After all, Celtic,  as a name, symbolised precisely what the Club was all about in the  first place. As with the people &#39;she&#39; represented and for whom &#39;she&#39;  would compete and triumph and for whom &#39;she&#39; would become an  irresistible attraction (to both Catholic and, in time, also Protestant  and other faiths), Celtic, the name, symbolised a club that had been  born in Scotland of Irish parents, had been lovingly raised by an Irish  Catholic family, had been tutored and schooled in Scotland amongst Irish  and Scots, of whatever denomination, and had been graduated by an,  ultimately, global university.[Link: <a href="/page/Celtic+-+The+Name" target="_self">Celtic the Name</a>, <a href="/page/Celtic+-+Pronunciation" target="_self">Celtic the Pronunciation</a>]<br><br>Would it have worked so beautifully otherwise? <br><br>Certainly,  Celtic immediately caught the mood - Archbishop Eyre of the Glasgow  Archdiocese was top of the subscription list of the new Club - and, in  January <a href="/page/1888" target="_self">1888</a> the following statement was released:<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="  WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%">CELTIC FOOTBALL AND ATHLETIC CLUB <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a>,  Parkhead (Corner of Dalmarnock and Janefield Streets) Patrons His Grace  the Archbishop of Glasgow and the Clergy of St Mary&#39;s, Sacred Heart and  St Michael&#39;s Missions, and the principal Catholic laymen of the East  End.<br><br>The above Club was formed in November <a href="/page/1887" target="_self">1887</a>,  by a number of Catholics of the East End of the City. The main object  is to supply the East End conferences of the St Vincent de Paul Society  with funds for the maintenance of the &#39;Dinner Tables&#39; of our needy  children in the Missions of St Mary&#39;s, Sacred Heart and St Michael&#39;s.  Many cases of sheer poverty are left unaided through lack of means. It  is therefore with this principal object that we have set afloat the  &#39;Celtic&#39; and we invite you as one of our ever-ready friends to assist in  putting our new Park in proper working order for the coming football  season.<br><br>We have already several of the leading Catholic football  players of the West of Scotland on our membership list. They have most  thoughtfully offered to assist in the good work. We are fully aware that  the &#39;elite&#39; of football players belong to this City and suburbs, and we  know that from there we can select a team which will be able to do  credit to the Catholics of the West of Scotland as the Hibernians have  been doing in the East.<br><br>Again there is also the desire to have a  large recreation ground where our Catholic young men will be able to  enjoy the various sports which will build them up physically, and we  feel sure we will have many supporters with us in this laudable object.&#39;</td></tr></tbody></table><br>There were two problems of immediacy. Firstly, Celtic had to find a home and, secondly, Celtic needed to find players.<br><br>Within  a week of being constituted, Celtic had leased an area of ground off  the Gallowgate in Parkhead, bounded on the west side by Janefield Street  and on the east by Dalmarnock Street (now Springfield Road). Within six  months, a voluntary workforce had built a ground that emulated the  highest standards of the time.<br><br>There was a level, grassy playing  field measuring 110 yards long and 66 yards wide, a basic earthen  terracing around three sides of the stadium and an open-air stand  (capable of accommodating 1,000 spectators) that contained a pavilion, a  referee&#39;s room, an office, dressing rooms and washing and toilet  facilities.<br><br>It should be recorded at this point that the &#39;old&#39; <a href="/page/Celtic+Park" target="_self">Celtic Park</a> is NOT the location of the current Celtic Park. In <a href="/page/1891" target="_self">1891</a>,  Celtic experienced trouble, yet again, with their greedy landlord (how  ironic, given the nature of the land disputes in Ireland) when he,  rather optimistically, increased the rent from &pound;50 per annum to &pound;450.  Celtic&#39;s committee men were far too shrewd and fleet of foot, business  wise, to tolerate such opportunism and, consequently, Celtic chose to  relocate.<br><br>We moved across the Janefield Street Cemetery to  &#39;Paradise&#39;, our current home and, once again utilising a volunteer  workforce, built a second Celtic Park in time for the start of the <a href="/page/1892" target="_self">1892</a>-93 season. <br><br><br><b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>Links</h3><ul><li>  <a href="/page/Brother+Walfrid" target="_self">Brother Walfrid</a>   </li><li>  <a href="/page/Celtic+Committee" target="_self">Original Celtic Committee</a></li></ul><h3>Articles</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Celtic+-+The+Name" target="_self">Celtic the Name</a></li><li><a href="/page/Celtic+-+Pronunciation" target="_self">Celtic the Pronunciation</a></li></ul><b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>Articles<br></h3>This  is the text of the fundraising circular sent round the parishes in  January 1888, very likely to have been written by Brother Walfrid  himself, which states clearly the objective of the club at our  foundation.<br><img align="bottom" alt="Brother Walfrid & the history of Celtic - The Celtic Wiki" height="637" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/695683ab828946a6ef726a815c2c9c6b/GW581H637" title="Brother Walfrid & the history of Celtic - The Celtic Wiki" width="581"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Brother Walfrid & the history of Celtic - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/750376117ab588b4b01d9bad19bdce68" title="Brother Walfrid & the history of Celtic - The Celtic Wiki"><br><br></div></div>

			<div style="margin-top:10px;">I recently worked on my genealogy and found that my great-great grandmother, Annie Welsh Tully (1864-1912)was born in Ireland and died in USA, Indiana.  Her father&#39;s name was Patrick Welsh.  A Patrick Welsh is mentioned on your page.  He would have been about the right age to be Annie&#39;s father.  Do you know if he had a daughter named Annie?  My great-great Grandfather, Peter Tully, was born in Indiana to parents who were both born in Ireland.  Peter&#39;s obituary when he died in 1914 stated that he was a member of the Hibernian Society.  </div>

									<div style="margin-top:10px;">If you search on scotlandspeople.gov.uk you can recover Pat &#39;Tailor&#39; Welsh&#39;s death certificate, but as he was not born in Scotland you&#39;d have to search the Irish records for details of his family connections.  The census records might indicate whether he had a daughter called Annie living with him at any point.  <br><br>The story is that, with the help of Willie Maley&#39;s father, Pat Welsh escaped from Dublin where he was being sought by the British for his Fenian activities.  </div>
