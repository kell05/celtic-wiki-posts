He was the kid whose juggling act ensured his name was on  everyone&rsquo;s lips, even though the main event was the most celebrated side  in the club&rsquo;s history. Tomorrow night, the recluse who could not handle  fame will return to the stage he abandoned. <br><br>Connelly, now 58,  will have an emotional reunion with the club he walked out on 32 years  ago. The former Celtic player will be the guest of honour at the  Champions League match with AC Milan and will be introduced to the  60,000 fans at half-time. The symmetry could not be better; Jock Stein  used to send Connelly out to entertain Celtic crowds during the interval  en route to the European Cup triumph in 1967, routinely keeping the  ball in the air for 2,000 touches. <br><br>Connelly is no ordinary  ex-player making the prize draw at half-time. He left Celtic in  controversial circumstances in 1975 and has never been back. Now he has  chosen to accept the club&rsquo;s overtures. The man who hung up his boots at  26 and became a taxi driver will be the VIP on an occasion packed full  of important people. Milan&rsquo;s glamorous cast of Champions League winners  and world champions are on display but Connelly&rsquo;s own CV stands scrutiny  with the best, playing in the 1970 European Cup final at the age of 21.  <br><br>David Hay, a former teammate and best friend in the Celtic  dressing-room, is glad to see Connelly finally return to the fold after  years spent fighting his own personal problems. &ldquo;George is basically a  very shy person who conquered it every time to go out on the pitch,&rdquo; Hay  said. &ldquo;He was brave enough to go out and do the keepie-uppie routine  for the fans when Jock asked him and he played in front of 136,000  people at Hampden Park when we beat Leeds in the 1970 European Cup  semi-final. I don&rsquo;t like making comparisons, but George had it in him to  be Franz Beckenbauer.&rdquo; <br><br>The Battle of Britain with Don Revie&rsquo;s  Leeds United saw Connelly at his best. He scored Celtic&rsquo;s winner in the  first leg at Elland Road and his performance in the return game at  Hampden helped to win a midfield battle against Johnny Giles and Billy  Bremner. Connelly came off the bench in the final when Celtic lost 2-1  to Feyenoord. He initially broke into the Celtic side in 1968 as a  midfield player and he set the trail for his young colleagues in the  reserves, a group containing Kenny Dalglish, Lou Macari, Danny McGrain  and Hay, who were dubbed &ldquo;The Quality Street Kids&rdquo;. <br><br>While  Dalglish would go on to fame and fortune at Liverpool, Connelly  disappeared from the football scene completely to work as a taxi driver  in Clackmannanshire. Yet, for a while, he, and not Dalglish, was the  hottest property in British football. The Fife-born player was just 20  when he scored in the 4-0 Scottish Cup final rout of Rangers in 1969 and  was named Scotland&rsquo;s Footballer of the Year in 1973. He would have  played in the 1974 World Cup finals but injury intervened and soon he  had tired of the game. <br><br>&ldquo;I think that as soon as I left Celtic to  join Chelsea in 1974, George felt more vulnerable,&rdquo; Hay, who took on  Stein in a dispute over more money a year earlier and went on strike for  a fortnight, said. &ldquo;George came out in sympathy with me. I actually  negotiated his contract. He was an exceptional talent who was lost to  the game, not through injury, but of his own accord.&rdquo; <br><br>Connelly  walked out out on Celtic five times before he quit in 1975, leaving  Stein bemused. He performed one of his disappearing acts before what  should have been his Scotland debut, walking out from the airport just  as Willie Ormond&rsquo;s squad were boarding a flight to Switzerland in May  1973. Ormond forgave the Celtic player and selected him for the crucial  World Cup qualifying tie with Czechoslovakia three months later that  took Scotland to the finals. <br><br>Connelly&rsquo;s other cap came in a  friendly with West Germany at Hampden, when he came face-to-face with  the real Beckenbauer and helped Scotland to a 1-1 draw. A cruel twist of  fate kept Connelly out of the 1974 World Cup finals, sustaining an  injury with Celtic in a European Cup quarter-final tie with FC Basle in  March of that year, ending his season. <br><br>He had a brief spell at  Falkirk before turning out for Sauchie Juniors. Connelly said two years  ago in a rare interview that his private life had been dominated by a  long battle with alcohol that he hopes is now won. He said: &ldquo;Jock was  sympathetic, even towards the end. He never even scolded me. He was  always good to me. I was 16 when I did the keepie-uppie at half-time in  the European game. Jock said he would give me a fiver if I would do it.  That was a lot to me. <br><br>&ldquo;Was I nervous? I wasn&rsquo;t, really. I was  too stupid to be nervous. Nowadays, I&rsquo;m one of those people who gets  easily embarrassed. If they said to me to go and do that now, I wouldn&rsquo;t  go near it. But then, you just did it.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>  Celtic&#39;s lost legend</h3>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/scotland/7093543.stmBy Julian Taylor</div><div>2007 <br>It  is the question Scottish football fans of a certain vintage have been  asking for over thirty years: whatever happened to George Connelly?<br><br>Just how did one of Celtic&#39;s most gifted ever players slide away from stardom and into oblivion?<br><br>Connelly  made 254 appearances for the Glasgow club between 1968-1975 and, until  now, was the foremost enigma of Scottish football.<br><br>With the world  at his feet, the elegant utlity player, nurtured by the legendary Jock  Stein and learning his craft with the Lisbon Lions, walked out for the  last time in 1975, unable to deal with the intensity of playing for one  half of the Old Firm.<br><br>A fledgling Connelly learned his football craft with the Lisbon Lions<br><br>And,  in doing so, his disenchantment with the game and his remarkable  decision to walk away from the big stage at 26 years old was a huge loss  both to Celtic and Scotland.<br><br>Finally, the Fife-born man has broken his silence with the publication of Celtic&#39;s Lost Legend: The George Connelly story.<br><br>Stein  had earmarked him as a natural successor to Billy McNeill as captain,  after immense performances, in particular, against Rangers in a 4-0  Scottish Cup final victory in 1969 and Leeds United in the 1970 European  Cup semi-final.<br><br>Ironically, the calm assurance of Connelly - who  won four Scottish titles and appreared in an abundance of cup finals -  on the park for a long time overshadowed his inner torment off it.<br><br>&#39;Quality Street Gang&#39;<br><br>Celtic&#39;s  famed conveyor belt of talent for a decade from the mid-1960s, known as  &#39;The Quality Street Gang,&#39; gave rise to Kenny Dalglish, David Hay, Lou  Macari, and Connelly.<br><br>His contemporaries enjoyed the fruits of  success with the Hoops before switching to Liverpool, Chelsea and  Manchester United respectively.<br><br>Connelly, hailed as the greatest  talent of his generation, however, hitched a ride on the down escalator  and into a private world of obscurity and, sadly, alcoholism.<br><br>With the benefit of hindsight he says: &quot;Can you imagine the number of people who wanted to tell me what a mug I had been?&quot;<br><br>Sean  Fallon, Stein&#39;s assistant, maintains that Connelly was the best player  he worked with in his time at Parkhead, and such high praise makes his  story all the more poignant.<br><br>However, after absconding from the  club he adored, Connelly was re-introduced to the Celtic supporters at  half-time during the recent Champions League game against AC Milan.<br><br>Little did this most modest and sensitive of men realise that he was always fondly regarded by contemporaries and fans alike.<br><br>Principally,  the book&#39;s appeal lies in Connelly&#39;s relationships with the Celtic  squad he grew up with as well as his thoughts on working with the Lisbon  Lions.<br><br>And, more importantly, it gives the Scot a belated chance  to address a few of his personal demons, which, he admits, has been a  therapeutic experience.<br><br>By the mid-1970s, Connelly found himself not just a lost Celt, but a lost soul.<br><br>And like others in the game, before and after, his attempts to replicate the buzz of playing with drinking failed miserably.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve  forgotten a whole lot more about my career than I&#39;ve remembered. I was  never obsessed with myself as a footballer, I just did things and that  was it - I forgot about them and ordered the next drink.&quot;<br><br>Now, an older, wiser, Connelly, 58, is in rude health and has found an inner contentment.<br><br>But what a shame, his light shone for only - by his own admission - two years at his peak.<br><br>The  fact that this most reclusive of players walked out on Scotland as well  due to his personal problems is testimony to how ill-equipped he was to  cope with the limelight.<br><br>After a starring role in Scotland&#39;s win  over Czechoslovakia to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, how the Scots  would have loved the injured Connelly to form a famed half-back line  alongside Billy Bremner and Jim Holton in Germany.<br><br>With  Celtic, it was a strange kind of love for Connelly, and while he  realised his mistake of quitting the club later, time waits for no man.<br><br>Indeed, Scotland&#39;s player of the year in 1973 spurned several chances to reboard and rebuild his career.<br><br>&quot;How I wish I could have justified his (Stein&#39;s) confidence in me,&quot; he admits.<br><br>&quot;My once buoyant spirit was beginning to flag faster than he could have imagined.<br><br>&quot;And,  in spite of my upbeat prediction about there always being the 1978  World Cup, I just knew it was never going to happen for me as far as  Scotland, or Celtic, for that matter were concerned.&quot;<br><br>Connelly&#39;s  candid story makes a fascinating read, not just for Celtic fans but for  all those who recall the skills of a player Stein dubbed &#39;The Scottish  Franz Beckenbauer.&#39;<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t believe the phenomenal reception I received on revisiting Celtic Park.

Referred to  as &ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s answer to Beckenbauer&rdquo; in his prime, George was the  elegant figure who astounded onlookers at a packed Celtic Park as a  16-year-old by performing his keepie-uppie routine right around the vast  expanses of Parkhead before a European encounter against Dynamo Kiev  (George is always keen to highlight that his ball-juggling took place  before the game, as many hazy memories have embellished the occasion to  having occurred at half-time).<br><br>It was the beginning of a  wonderful career, which took him to the 1970 European Cup final,  Scotland&rsquo;s Player of the Year in 1973, qualification for the World Cup  finals in 1974, and many more league and cup winners&rsquo; medals along the  way. <br><br>But it ended all-too-soon, and for a multitude of reasons.George  and I first met for a few tins of Diet Irn Bru at The Unicorn  Restaurant in Kincardine to chat about the book I was writing at the  time &ndash; The Quality Street Gang.Having relished the chance  to spend a couple of hours with this man of mystery, I vividly recall  the last thing that George said to me that summer&rsquo;s day in 2010, just as  I was about the get back into my car (he had walked me right up to the  door like the gentleman that he is): &ldquo;The way I&rsquo;m feeling today, Paul, I  never want to touch drink again.&rdquo;<br><br>We hadn&rsquo;t discussed his  much-publicised battle with alcohol during our interview because I  wanted to focus on his vintage talent, something that I felt had often  been overshadowed by stories of the demon drink. George brought it up  almost as an afterthought, and his statement of intent filled me with a  great sense of positivity because it felt as though he meant every word  of it.I had idolised George Connelly since I was a  youngster, playing football for our hometown side, High Valleyfield. <br><br>The  men who ran the team &ndash; Iain Downie and Mick Hutton &ndash; were old pals of  George (to this day, Mick is still very close to him) and hardly a  training session went by without one of them enrapturing my young  team-mates and I with tales of the almost mythical talents of George.<br><br>The  rise and fall of George Connelly is undoubtedly a story of cinematic  proportions. In fact, a few years ago, I was involved in making the  feature-length documentary about the Quality Street team he was part of.  Sadly, after around 18 months of working alongside False 9 (the team  behind Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler and Sean Fallon biopic, The Iron Man) production  hit a brick wall. <br><br>Hopefully some day we will resurrect the project.<br><br>If  we do, then George has rewritten the final scenes for us. The &lsquo;rise and  fall&rsquo; story would now end with the archetypal Hollywood happy ending&hellip;George  hasn&rsquo;t touched booze for four-and-a-half years, and he looks a picture  of health in sobriety. He decided that he was ready to make his first  &lsquo;public&rsquo; appearance in 11 years a fortnight ago when he agreed to help  me out with the first-ever Quality Street Gang book signing.<br><br>Celtic  fans flocked to see the Fifer at The Penalty Spot in Glasgow&rsquo;s Sword  Street, with some travelling from as far as Leeds and Folkestone to  shake his hand and get their long-awaited photograph taken with him.  Former Chelsea and Manchester United midfielder, Jim McCalliog, was  among the crowd, as was ex-Celt, Tosh McKinlay, who upon asking George  if he could get his photo taken with him, was met with the response,  &ldquo;Can I get my photo taken with you, Tosh?<br><br>&rdquo;Everyone in  attendance felt blessed to spend a couple of hours with the man whose  own autobiography was titled, Celtic&rsquo;s Lost Legend.Paul John Dykes  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>George Connelly</h3><div>from http://www.celticfc.net/news/16293</div><div>  <h3> </h3>HIS GREATEST GAME v Rangers - September 16, 1972<br><br>CELTIC  moved this league game to Hampden due to building work  still to be  completed on their newly-built main stand at Celtic Park.<br><br>Rangers  came to Hampden full of confidence after their success in the  European  Cup-Winners&#39; Cup just a few months previously, while Celtic  were  without the influential trio of Jim Brogan, Davie Hay and Bobby  Lennox  as Jock Stein drafted in the young threesome of Danny McGrain,  Pat  McCluskey and Lou Macari to replace them.<br><br>Celtic took control from  the off and opened the scoring in only two  minutes when Jimmy Johnstone  headed a Macari cross on to Kenny Dalglish  to score from close range.  Celtic smelled blood at this stage and  continued their onslaught on the  Rangers goal and in 17 minutes they  scored a second when Dalglish beat  Sandy Jardine on the left and set up  Johnstone to score easily.<br><br>At  this stage of the game, Celtic where imperious with Bobby Murdoch  and  Tommy Callaghan controlling the midfield area and attackers  Johnstone,  Dalglish and Macari being unplayable up front.<br><br>However, Celtic&#39;s  superiority started from the back where Billy  McNeill and George  Connelly had the much-vaunted Rangers strike duo of  Colin Stein and  Derek Johnstone totally under wraps.<br>Connelly was now in the apex of  his career and he gave a virtuoso  display of long passing, effortlessly  turning defence into attack in an  instant, as a regular supply of  through balls where played into the  danger areas behind Rangers defence  for Macari and Dalglish to fasten on  to.<br><br>In the first half, big  George had delighted the Celtic fans by  carrying out an impromptu  display of keepy-up, seemingly daring the  Rangers players to come and  get the ball off him, but there were no  takers as the Celtic supporters  roared with approval.<br><br>Macari scored a third early in the second half  as Celtic threatened  to run all over their great rivals. Three times  Rangers&#39; defenders  cleared Celtic efforts off the line, although as the  game wore on, the  Celtic players were now happy to keep possession and  let the Rangers&#39;  players chase around in frustration with George  Connelly at the centre  of the possession play.<br><br>The Rangers fans  began to leave long before the end and in the last  minute John Greig  burst through to score at the Celtic End of the ground  where the Hoops  fans greeted the goal with a huge ironic roar as Greig  &#39;saluted&#39; them  in return.<br><br>The Celtic fans may have cheered Greig&#39;s goal with a  certain amount  of humour but there was also an element of grudging  admiration as Greig  was the only Rangers player who hadn&#39;t accepted his  fate long before the  final whistle.<br><br>The media stated afterwards  that the gap between the two clubs on the  field of play had never  appeared so great such was Celtic&#39;s  superiority, although some Hoops  fans were annoyed that the team had  wound down in the second half and  hadn&#39;t gone for the jugular to score  more goals to add to Rangers&rsquo;  humiliation.<br><br>Celtic had many fine players on the day and George  Connelly had been  majestic throughout. Comparisons were now being made  between the Celtic  sweeper and the great West German star of the  period, Franz Beckenbauer,  and there were certainly similarities  between their playing styles.<br><br>At the end of the season, George  Connelly was selected as the  Scottish Sports Writers&rsquo; Player of the  Year as he kept up his fine form  with a string of consistent displays.<br><br>This  game was part of the reason he was selected for that award and  Celtic  fans were to fondly remember his bold keepy-up display in the  heat of a  Glasgow derby for many years to come.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3></div><div></div></div></div>
