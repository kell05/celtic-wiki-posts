How did he celebrate? Brown marched right up to Diouf (as in the below picture), stood toe to toe and outstretched his arms, staring  straight into his face to wind him up. Think of the stance of the iconic  Jesus Christ statue in Brazil, and that&#39;s what it was like. It was aped by the Celtic support who called it the Broony and used to wind-up successfull the Rangers fans.<br></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Review<img align="right" alt="BROO-OONYY !" height="412" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c607a8341d2da1df8e25bc42599837bd/GW339H412" title="BROO-OONYY !" width="339"></h3>the most interesting thing to come out of today is that lennon and his team appear to have worked rangers out, and smith and mccoist don&#39;t have an answer to us.  <br><br>rangers&#39; man advantage for almost half the game should have let them pass the ball clean through us in the midfield. davis, edu and diouf are all good passers of the ball, and ness has shown before that he is comfortable playing a passing game. and yet when they were given the opportunity to come out, they remained deep and narrow.<br><br>partly that has to do with david weir, who doesn&#39;t have the pace to play a high back line. normally mcculloch would sit right in front of him, which would free up the rangers midfield a bit more. but edu doesn&#39;t have mcculloch&#39;s positional discipline, so it was more of a group effort; davis popped up in front of the huns back-line quite a bit, as did ness while he was still on. they were clearly trying to counter the pace and directness of hooper by staying deep.<br><br>when strachan and mowbray were in charge that plan worked well for the huns, although for different reasons. but by playing so deep, rangers surrender a lot of possession higher up the park. it also makes pressing a lot more difficult, because you&#39;re chasing the ball over longer distances - something the huns (particularly jelavic, naismith and davis) did very well in the first half before dropping off noticeably in the second.<br><br>a big part of that was our deliberate ploy of keeping the ball at the back. mulgrew gets slated on here, but he&#39;s a very good passer of the ball and at times did what mcculloch does for the huns - took the ball of the midfield when they were under pressure and maintained possession. in effect, mulgrew operated as a 6th midfielder when required, which gave us a 6 v 5 advantage. crucially, we maintained that throughout the match. that let us keep the ball well in front of the huns midfield, and in effect forced them to come out.<br><br>when we went down to 10 men, lennon pushed the full backs further up (in essence using them as wing backs) and tucked ledley and brown inside to keep our man advantage in the midfield. we kept possession very well in the deep positions and managed to get round the huns using izaguirre and wilson. wilson in particular did well in combining with brown so that diouf (and later weiss) didn&#39;t get an awful lot of space down that side.<br><br>the shocking thing, from rangers&#39; point of view, is that we were able to operate the same game plan even when we were a man short. when we were playing 4-5-1, we were keeping the ball and looking to get down the flanks; when we moved to what was almost a 3-5-1 (with ki sitting very deep and izaguirre and wilson pushed forward) we were still able to do the same thing. rangers had no answer, they couldn&#39;t come out from their deep position because weir would be exposed; they couldn&#39;t sit back because we were having all the possession. in the end, they looked like they were clinging on.<br><br>a lot of praise has to go to izaguirre and wilson, they put in astonishing shifts and were the focal points of our attacks. the rangers goals came from a wonderstrike from ness, and a shocking defensive mistake from majstorovic, who was caught 5 yards behind our line and played naismith completely on. had he been match sharp, i don&#39;t think he&#39;d have made such a fundamental error. but that must be a concern for rangers - they&#39;re reliant on a moment of sheer brilliance or a mistake from us. both of our goals, on the other hand, stemmed from our tactical dominance - overlaps down the left for both, and unchecked midfield runners getting both goals, although brown&#39;s finish was magnificient.<br><br>all in all, i thought we were simply stunning today. lennon and his team completely out-thought smith and mccoist today - intriguing that the areas that we did especially well in today were the positions that the management team played in themselves. you can see a bit of thompson in ledley and commons... lennon in kayal... parker and mjallby were decent ball-playing centre-backs in their day. whether it&#39;s by accident or design, this management team have come up with the solution to beating rangers. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3>  <div class="statslist">  <div class="colone">  <h3>  Rangers</h3>  <ul class="teamlist">  <li>  01 McGregor   </li><li>  03 Weir;

Brown earns 10-man Celtic Cup replay</h3>Scott Brown struck a stunning equaliser to earn 10-man <a class="external" href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/celtic/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Celtic</a> a deserved Scottish Cup replay with Glasgow rivals Rangers after an absorbing 2-2 draw in their fifth round tussle at Ibrox.   <div class="sp-article-additional">  <br><div class="mod alt nofoot inner sp-mod-link-list">  <br><div class="ft">  <div class="wrapper">  </div></div>  <div class="ft">  </div></div></div>The winners of the replay at Celtic Park on March 2 face a trip to fellow Scottish Premier League side <a class="external" href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/football/inverness/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inverness Caledonian Thistle</a> in the quarter-finals on the weekend of March 12/13.   <br>Celtic recovered from twice trailing at Ibrox despite having goalkeeper Fraser Forster sent off for taking out Steven Naismith - who was later sent off for diving in the visiting area 15 minutes from time - on 41 minutes. <br>Despite a wait of several minutes for Celtic to reorganise, Scotland full-back Steven Whittaker stepped up to send substitute goalkeeper Lukasz Zaluska the wrong way from the penalty spot as Rangers moved 2-1 ahead at the interval.<br>The home side were reduced to 10 men when Naismith was sent off for a second yellow card on 74 minutes after he dived in the box under pressure from Charlie Mulgrew with the match level at 2-2. <br>Replays showed that referee Calum Murray got the red card decision right with Naismith going to ground with the visiting central defender failing to make any contact with the Rangers forward. <br>Rangers had moved into the lead on only three minutes when Jamie Ness thumped a wonderful effort into the net from 30 yards out that flew through the legs of Kris Commons before nestling in the rigging.<br>It was teenager Ness&#39;s first goal for Rangers and gave Forster no chance. <br>Commons levelled for Celtic on 16 minutes when he smashed Joe Ledley&#39;s pass beyond the home goalkeeper Allan McGregor from 12 yards out.<br>After falling behind to Whittaker&#39;s penalty, Celtic showed admirable character with captain Brown equalising for the 10 men on 65 minutes after swerving a delightful 25-yard shot beyond McGregor.<br>Celtic enjoyed 67% of possession and may feel slightly disappointed that they did not leave Ibrox with the win. <br>The two Glasgow rivals will do it all again in the replay at Celtic Park on March 2. <br>The sides are set to meet seven times this season in the Scottish Premier League, the CIS Cup final and the Scottish Cup. <br>Both teams remain on course for a domestic treble, but home manager Walter Smith will be concerned about the manner in which his side seemed to fall out of the contest in the second period. <br>With El Hadji Diouf making his debut in the Old Firm fixture for Rangers after completing his loan move from Blackburn earlier in the week, Rangers made a vibrant start and could have been 2-0 ahead on four minutes when Nikica Jelavic set up Steven Davis, who saw his shot come crashing back off the bar. <br>Celtic came to life after that scare with McGregor saving from Beram Kayal and Gary Hooper screwing a shot wide of the goal before Commons restored parity. <br>Rangers almost struck a minute after Brown&#39;s equaliser when Jelavic, who had supplied Naismith with the pass that saw Forster sent off, overhit a pass to Davis that the Northern Irishman just failed to connect with as he dashed into the area.<br>Despite that miss, Celtic were the dominant force for large swathes of the match - even with the one-man handicap. <br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon was bold in his changes.<br>He was forced to withdraw the impressive Commons after Forster&#39;s red card while the introduction of Georgios Samaras for Kayal in the second period to partner Hooper were pivotal moments in helping Celtic rescue the tie.<br>Brown was booked for appearing to taunt Diouf after he netted, but the Scotland midfielder continued to drive Celtic forward in their search for a winner as Rangers struggled to get out of their own half. <br>Only a miraculous stop from McGregor in the home goal on 72 minutes denied Samaras the decisive goal as he kept out the Greece striker&#39;s header from point-blank range. <br>Rangers threw on Kyle Lafferty and Vladimir Weiss for Diouf and Jelavic, but it did little to alter the pattern of the afternoon.

At 2-1 at the break against 10 men you have to fancy your chances of winning the game.&quot;   <div class="bo">  Rangers twice took the lead through an early Jamie Ness strike and a Steven Whittaker penalty, but Celtic came back to level each time thanks to goals from Kris Commons and Scott Brown. <br>Forster was sent off as he gave away the penalty for a foul on Steven Naismith, who was dismissed himself for a second booking for diving 15 minutes from full time. <br>Even though Rangers enjoyed a numerical advantage for so long, for large spells it was the depleted Celtic side who dictated play. <br>&quot;We certainly had good chances to score and win the game,&quot; said McCoist. &quot;But I think Celtic at least deserved a draw today. <br>&quot;I didn&#39;t think we got to their full-backs quick enough. Izaguirre and Wilson were excellent for them going forward, and our own full-backs didn&#39;t attack enough. </div>  <div class="ibox">  <b>Even though Celtic are at home we don&#39;t think it&#39;s advantage anybody, we&#39;ve been there already this season and won 3-1 </b><br>Ally McCoist </div>  <div class="bo">  &quot;It was a great strike from Jamie to get us into the lead, and that&#39;s the second derby in-a-row we started really well. <br>&quot;And then we&#39;re really unlucky not to go two up when Steven Davis hit the bar. <br>&quot;If that goes in it&#39;s a wonderful start, but it wasn&#39;t to be, and I just felt we took our foot off the pedal a little bit.&quot; <br>Naismith received his second yellow card as he tried to win a second Rangers penalty - one which McCoist felt should have been awarded. <br>&quot;It looked a stonewall penalty to me,&quot; he said. &quot;It was one of our best moves of the game and it looked like penalty. <br>&quot;But if I was to pick a man-of-the-match it would be the referee today, so I&#39;m not going to criticise him.&quot; </div>  <div class="bo">  Rangers must now negotiate a replay at Celtic Park for the right to visit Inverness in the quarter-finals. <br>&quot;Even though Celtic are at home we don&#39;t think it&#39;s advantage anybody. <br>&quot;We&#39;ve been there already this season and won 3-1. <br>&quot;It gives us another tough game against Celtic, but we&#39;ll play better in the next game, and hopefully win.&quot; <br>Much of the pre-match attention was focussed on the inclusion of El-Hadji Diouf, who spat on a Celtic fan while playing for Liverpool in a Uefa Cup tie in Glasgow in 2003. <br>&quot;I thought he did fine, he played the game well, and handled the situation very well,&quot; said McCoist. <br>&quot;Once or twice there were people trying to wind him up and he walked away from it. <br>&quot;I&#39;m more than happy with his performance.&quot; </div>Story from BBC SPORT:  <br>http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/9389189.stm<br><br>Published: 2011/02/06 19:25:08 GMT<br><br>&copy; BBC 2011<br><br><div class="matchLiveText collapsible">  <ul>  <li>  Final Result   </li><li>  Full Time   </li><li>  90:00+2:07 The referee brings the game to a close.   </li><li>  90:00+0:40 Vladimir Weiss sends in a cross, comfortable save by Lukasz Zaluska.   </li><li>  89:21 Kyle Lafferty produces a left-footed shot from deep inside the penalty box which goes wide of the left-hand upright.   </li><li>  86:51 Vladimir Weiss challenges Mark Wilson unfairly and gives away a free kick.
