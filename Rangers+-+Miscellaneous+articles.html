Mobs of Rangers&#39; supporters&mdash;their team defeated 2-0&mdash;smashed their  way through the streets. Police, ambulances and hospitals were swamped  with calls for help. More than 100 people had been injured in a stadium  melee which resulted in the Fairs Cities Cup-tie against Newcastle  United being suspended for 17 minutes.<br><br>At midnight,  Northumberland Police said that they had made 29 arrests: 24 were  Glaswegians. Running fights had broken out from pub to pub. Bedlam came  to the Central Station when hundreds of chanting supporters formed a  human chain across the road blocking all traffic. As the Scots tumbled  out of public-houses waving bottles and glasses in the air, calls for  help were being flashed to the Central Police Station at the rate of one  a minute. Even the police station was under siege at one time. Dog  handlers were sent out to quell the riot.<br><br>In one incident, a  seven-year-old boy with his father, Mr James Smith, of Nayworth Drive,  Westerhope, was set upon by a gang as they waited at a bus stop. The boy  was beaten to the ground and Mr Smith was struck about the head. He was  left bleeding on the pavement.<br><br>The Newcastle hospitals &mdash; the  General and Royal Victoria Infirmary&mdash;were so full patients were also  taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead. One Rangers supporter  was seriously ill with crushed ribs. Hospital staff were trying to  discover his identity.<br>Frogmarched<br><br>There were just ten minutes  to go in the semi-final at St James&#39;s Park when the stadium became an  arena. The referee stopped the game and players were sent to safety in  the dressing room as police with dogs clashed with invading Scottish  supporters.<br><br>Some were frogmarched off. Some had to be helped off.  One was carried on a stretcher. St. John ambulance men were kept busy  as the casualty list mounted. Two policemen were injured -- one was  detained in hospital with a neck injury.<br><br>The invasion began after  Newcastle had taken a 2-0 lead. The Rangers crowd were clearly out to  wreck the game and save their team from defeat.<br><br><b><font size="4">Onslaught </font></b><br><br>Shortly  before half-time about 100 supporters had dashed on to the pitch but  were cleared by the police. Later, the referee announced over the  loudspeaker system that players would be taken off if the crowd  stampeded. That was just what he did when the onslaught came.<br><br>And  after 17 minutes of chaos &mdash;quelled only when marauding fans were  confronted by police dogs&mdash;the pitch was cleared and play restarted.<br><br>An  ambulance spokesman said: &quot;The trouble was all from the Rangers  supporters, who were drunk before the match started. Most of the injured  had cut heads from flying bottles,&quot; he said.<br><br>One man had his  artificial arm pulled off, it took several minutes before it was found  and replaced. Several people had dog bites after they were chased back  on to the terraces.<div><br>Many casualties were carried from the field,  and when the pitch was eventually cleared there was a big heap of cans,  bottles and torn national flags behind one goal.<br><br>When the field  was cleared police lined shoulder-to-shoulder along the by-lines facing  the terracing where the trouble started. Police dogs formed a second  line and the crowd applauded the return to order.<br><br>Some of the  injured in Newcastle General Hospital last night were:&mdash;David Bell,  Ardenly Street, Glasgow; John Smillie, Cumberland Place, Coatbridge,  Lanarkshire; Robert Cunnachie, of Glasgow; John Bell, Irvine Road,  Kilmarnock; Andrew Rankine, Lloyd Street, Glasgow; David Cain, Glasgow;  Alan Turner, Sutton Drive, Newcastle; and John Johnstone, Conston Place,  Glasgow.<br><br>Tension had begun to build up in the afternoon as  thousands of chanting Rangers&#39; supporters, some of them carrying Orange  banners, flooded Newcastle. Two hours before the game three had been  arrested&mdash;two for drunkenness and one for theft. A public-house window  was smashed and two people were taken to hospital after a street brawl.<br><br>The  tension erupted minutes before the kick-off when Rangers&#39; fans battered  down a gate at the ground. Mounted police fought a fierce battle as  supporters surged through the opening at the Gallowgate end. <br><br>Two policemen were injured and six ambulances ferried casualties to city hospitals.<br><br>Inside  the ground six constables tried to stem the stampede without success.  Three mounted officers struggled through the crowd to help them. After  15 minutes they managed to block the gate&mdash;but not before 300 had got in.  Many people were injured as they were trampled under foot.<br><br>Ambulances  sent to pick up the injured were unable to force a way through the  thousands of people converging on the open gate. Within half an hour  police had the situation under control.<br><br><b><font size="4">Ugly incidents</font></b><br><br>Those  fans who did gate-crash threw their tickets over the wall and more  trouble developed when people without tickets started fighting for them.  One mounted officer was confronted by 500 angry Rangers supporters. His  appeals for order were greeted with jeers.<br><br>At the Gallowgate end  dozens of Rangers supporters tried to clamber into the ground over the  walls. One slipped on a spike and another fell on to an electric power  wire and fused some lights at the ground.<br><br>The match itself was tense, with many fouls and ugly incidents.<br><br>More  than a dozen policemen lined the platform at Waverley Station for the  arrival of the Rangers special from Newcastle early today, but there was  no trouble.<br><br>Police who travelled on the train for part of the  journey said the first part of the trip had been noisy but the  passengers had quietened down.<br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>The Scotsman Editorial Comment 23/24 May 1969<br></h3><br><b><font size="5">Rangers must act</font></b><br><br>The  directors of Rangers have shown proper regret for the actions of some  of their supporters during the Newcastle match. They have called this  ugly element &quot;a blot on the club,&quot; and promised action. That is welcome,  but those hooligans are more than a blot on one football club. The  scenes in Newcastle, the actions of some drunken riff raff, blot the  reputation of Glasgow and Scotland. Other English cities have learnt  through experience to fear the maniac supporters Rangers bring with  them. Wednesday&#39;s incidents seem to have been on a bigger scale than  before, but the now-promised action is long overdue.<br><br>Rangers&#39;  directors could have done nothing else than denounce the hooligans. But  one must wonder whether they have shown much zeal in trying to oust the  hooligan element or given the lead that is needed. To judge from the  songs heard at Rangers matches there seems to be a close affinity  between that element and the extreme Protestant bigots one associates  with Northern Ireland. Do the directors consider they are helping the  club by their inflexible attitude to religion? It is sorry commentary on  their outlook that foreigners may play for the team but not Scots  footballers, who happen to be Catholics. The club ought to move with the  times.<br><br>From now on&mdash;as is the case with their rivals, Celtic&mdash;the  only criterion required to play for the team should be football skill.  But much more is needed. In fairness to Rangers, it has to be  acknowledged that a section of Celtic supporters have likewise brought  disrepute to their club and Scotland by their disgraceful behaviour when  their team were playing in England. Continuous influence needs to be  exerted by the directors of both and by their supporters&rsquo; clubs to root  out the hooligan elements. Celtic players gave an example to all the  supporters of both teams when they cheered the Milan team off the field  at Parkhead after being unexpectedly beaten. It is to be anticipated  that the European football authorities will deal with what happened at  Newcastle. But it would be quite wrong if Scottish clubs generally were  punished. The mere fact however, that this has been suggested ought to  be a reminder of what is involved. It is an entirely different sort of  reputation that Scotland wants to gain.<div><br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>1974</h3>Article  is from  the short-lived alternative football magazine/paper &quot;Foul&quot;.  Foul ran  from 1972 to 1976 and was in effect the first modern football  fanzine.

But something has happened at Ibrox,<br> something you can&#39;t put your finger on, which seems to have propelled them<br> into a different orbit.<br> <br> And so, as Ajax sat back waiting with a spacecake and an Oranjeboom and<br> Fergie came out gloating that the player was his, Muz quietly got down to<br> the business of making Laudrup stay.<br> <br> Were I a Celtic man, I would be so afraid. No manager, no sign of a manager,<br> two biggest names threatening to do a bunk, no sign of new blood, season<br> ticket holders in a major huff.<br> <br> Call me picky, but things do not look good. And hell mend them.<br> I cannot believe how quickly and how far Fergus McCann has allowed things to<br> slip, especially after Tommy Burns took them so close.<br> <br> It is easy to say now that Burns was a failure, but what is nearer to the<br> truth is that he was a very good manager with the wrong club.<br> <br> The closer he got to toppling Rangers, the more his emotional attachment to<br> Celtic overtook the rational thinking his job required.<br> <br> Others would disagree, but I reckon Burns will go on to be a huge success<br> elsewhere, starting in King Kenny&#39;s bootroom at the Toon.<br> <br> What is not up for argument, though, is that Celtic are in a far worse state<br> without him than they were with him. Rangers are leaving them further and<br> further behind with every passing day and there is no white smoke from the<br> Parkhead chimney to signal a comeback.<br> <br> The Ibrox men are, I reckon, one more signing away from finally leaving<br> their greatest rivals - and, therefore, the rest of us - so far behind them<br> they will be no more than a dancing dot on the horizon.<br> <br> Who is that signing? I&#39;d go for Batistuta - though Muz says no - but whoever<br> they end up with he will be big time and he will be here soon.<br> <br> It&#39;s enough to make any Celtic fan hide behind the couch.

The eventual cash <br>injection could soar as high as &pound;80m as Murray guides the club into what he believes <br>will be a new, golden era for the Scottish champions. The money involved, the <br>biggest financial boost for any Scottish football club, will enable them to move into <br>Europe&#39;s elite over the next few years. Yesterday, however, Murray maintained, as <br>always, that he will not turn his back on Scottish football to play in any other league, <br>and that while he remains in charge of the club, he will retain a responsibility to the <br>domestic game.<br><br>It is clear from this latest move, however, that the Glasgow giants are setting an <br>agenda that no other Scottish club can match - and that appears to include their Old <br>Firm rivals, Celtic, who are trailing by 15 points in the Premier League championship <br>and are now looking at a financial gap which the Parkhead club might not be able to <br>bridge. There have been hints around Glasgow that Celtic could be ready to attempt <br>a share flotation of their own, but it would seem unlikely they would be able to match <br>the financial clout that Murray has put together. The Ibrox chairman promised his <br>shareholders good news and a more prudent financial strategy at the last annual <br>meeting of the club. He has now delivered this by taking on board several very <br>heavy financial hitters, South African-based David King is worth around &pound;300m - <br>&pound;20m of which he is investing in the club he followed as a young man in Glasgow.<br><br>The Ibrox chairman has spent several months and many sleepless nights piecing <br>together the plans which will eliminate Rangers&#39; debt, currently sitting at around <br>&pound;40m, provide finance for the new training centre and the soccer academy which will <br>be housed there, and still allow cash to invest in new players. He said: &quot;I want to <br>make it clear from the outset that while our small shareholders, our supporters who <br>have an interest in the club, will have the opportunity to invest again if they want, <br>there is no pressure on them to do so.The bulk of the rights issue is being taken up <br>by myself and David King and some other smaller investors, including Alastair <br>Johnston, who is a long-time Rangers supporter. We also have Trevor Hemmings <br>coming in as an investor and Tom Hunter will join us some time in the future. <br>Essentially, the investment we require is in place and we also have a major media <br>deal in the pipeline which is very exciting and will bring in further serious investment <br>to the club. I told you earlier this week that I had run the club up to now on a <br>high-risk strategy which has involved carrying large debt.&quot;<br><br>&quot;These days are over. The whole method of running the club is going to change, <br>because we are in a situation right now where we do not need to take the risks we <br>have had to take in the past. We don&#39;t have to spend the same money on players, <br>for example, as we have had to do over the past two years when we were <br>restructuring the team after the arrival of Dick Advocaat. At the moment, we have <br>two new players set for next season, Allan Johnston and Fernando Ricksen and Dick <br>is looking for another quality striker. He is working hard on that right now. Dick and <br>myself know what we are aiming for. We want to be in the Champions League every <br>season. This is what we want for the club and this is what we have been working <br>towards. However, we shall not be going on any wild spending sprees in the transfer <br>market. We have a player or two to add to the squad - a top-class international front <br>player, as I said, but we don&#39;t need to buy Numan, van Bronckhorst, Mols, Reyna, or <br>McCann - because we have these lads in place already.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Believe me when I tell you that we are going for it this time - we want to be <br>successful in Europe, and the money we are raising now will take us there.&quot;<br><br>&quot;This is the last part of the jigsaw for me, but we shall always be a part of Scottish <br>football and we will take our domestic responsibilities seriously. We respect the other <br>teams in the Premier League and we know this news will make them try even harder <br>against us. But, so be it. Barcelona don&#39;t win every week. Bayern Munich don&#39;t win <br>every week. Manchester United don&#39;t win every week. Yet, our supporters expect us <br>to do so and we shall always try to do that. What we do know is that to be in the <br>Champions League, we have to win the Scottish title, and that is our aim every <br>season. We shall always be here with our roots.&quot; However, the mega-deals Murray <br>has been working on are sure to carry Rangers out of the reach of their rivals here <br>at home and unless Celtic can somehow find the means to strengthen their own <br>financial standing even the age-old rivalry between the Glasgow giants will be <br>threatened as the Ibrox men grow ever stronger.<br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Airdrie FC &quot;Business as usual&quot; at Airdrie&#39;s ground</h3><br> Wednesday, 2 February, 2000, 15:52 GMT<br>Hope remains for struggling Airdrie<br><br><br>Provisional liquidators called in to Scottish First Division strugglers Airdrie have expressed hope that the club can be saved.<br><br>They have voiced confidence that a backroom shake-up would allow new investment to come into the club.<br><br>The Diamonds have called an extraordinary general meeting to discuss a change of constitution which could ensure its survival.<br><br>Up  until now, no Airdrie shareholder has been allowed to own more than 10%  of the shares - a matter which has been scheduled for discussion at  Monday&#39;s meeting.<br><br>Blair Nimmo, head of KPMG Corporate Recovery in  Scotland, has been appointed as the club&#39;s provisional liquidator and  expressed optimism for the future.<br><br>He said: &quot;While the  liquidation is a serious matter for the club, I would like to stress our  focus will be on creating a firm foundation for the future development  of Airdrie FC.<br><br>&quot;The club has first class facilities and is an important institution within Scottish football - it just needs new investment.<br><br>&quot;Hopefully  a new constitution will be the catalyst which enables the introduction  of new investors with the funds, and the ideas, to take the club  forward.&quot;<br><br>&#39;Business as usual&#39;<br><br>In the meantime, Mr Nimmo  said it would be &quot;business as usual&quot; at the Lanarkshire club, currently  lying at second bottom in the First Division.<br><br>Airdrie&#39;s problems  worsened when it was revealed that Rangers had arrested the club&#39;s share  of the gate receipts for Sunday&#39;s Scottish Cup tie at Dundee United.<br><br><b>Airdrie v Rangers Airdrie&#39;s finances have been tackled by David Murray<br>Ibrox  chairman David Murray applied for an interdict, on behalf of his  company Carnegie, for a debt of around &pound;30,000 owed by Airdrie.<br><br>Mr  Murray said: &quot;I feel very sorry for Airdrie and their supporters but  we&#39;re running a business.

He was right.&quot;<br><br>Back  then, at the same stage - and allowing three points for a win - Celtic  were 23 behind the leaders and Billy McNeill was sacked as the manager.<br><br>Eight  managers in nine years is no way to run a pub, never mind a football  club, and only Wim Jansen was able to deliver a title.<br><br>Now, with  Celtic at their lowest ebb since they were 20 points adrift with 10  games left under Tommy Burns in 1995, Gough fears his old rivals are  going backwards rather than forward.<br><br>He said: &quot;Sunday was the  biggest Old Firm victory for Rangers since the 5-1 game in 1988 and I  was lucky enough to play in that match.<br><br>&quot;However, yesterday was  even more of a beating than that one. At least back then Celtic scored  first and gave us a match for a while.<br><br>&quot;But on Sunday I turned to  my Everton team-mate Dave Watson in the stand after half-an-hour and  said, &#39;This could be a cricket score&#39;. Rangers were totally dominant.<br><br>&quot;Football is basically a simple game. It&#39;s about good players - and Rangers had all the good players.<br><br>&quot;Apart from Paul Lambert, Mark Viduka and Jonathan Gould in goal, Celtic didn&#39;t have anyone who deserved pass marks.<br><br>&quot;What I found really odd was the lack of passion from those Celtic players.<br><br>&quot;I  remember beating Celtic 4-1 and 5-1 but guys like Peter Grant and Paul  McStay would still be running around like madmen right to the death to  have a kick at you.<br><br>&quot;At 2-0 on Sunday I watched Rangers knock  together 20 or so passes right in front of the Celtic dug-out until  Tommy Burns eventually had to run out and urge someone to make a  tackle.&quot;<br><br>Gough believes Celtic&#39;s foreign legion are particularly guilty of failing to play for the jersey.<br><br>He  said: &quot;The new men brought in by Dick Advocaat discovered what it meant  to lose an Old Firm game after the 5-1 game at Parkhead last season.<br><br>&quot;It  was a rude awakening and if Celtic&#39;s foreigners ever thought that  losing without a fight was acceptable they&#39;ll know differently now.<br><br>&quot;Sunday  was the first time I&#39;ve seen Celtic fans leaving long before the end of  the game. We gave them some duntings in the past but they would always  stay behind and sing in a show of defiance.<br><br>&quot;Then again, there wasn&#39;t too much defiance from the players, was there?&quot;<br><br>Gough  feels particular sympathy for Burns, who was back in an Ibrox dug-out  for the first time since his career as Celtic manager ended with defeat  there to Falkirk in a Scottish Cup semi-final three years ago.<br><br>He  said: &quot;It all comes down to the quality of player in your side and  Tommy Burns will know that better than anyone. The season we made it  eight in a row, the team he managed lost just once as they pushed us all  the way to the wire. He worked with people such as Pierre van  Hooijdonk, Paolo di Canio, Jorge Cadete, Paul McStay and John Collins  and it was a far better team than they have now.<br><br>&quot;In fact, I  think their quality has dipped ever since - and I include in this their  double-winning side that came together during a particularly poor season  for us.&quot;<br><br>Gough, who had answered an emergency call from Kansas  to return to Ibrox in 1997 after quitting five months earlier, admits  that a new broom was required at his old club. He said: &quot;That team  needed to be rebuilt and David Murray made an excellent appointment in  Dick Advocaat, who has made all the required alterations.<br><br>&quot;Rangers  are definitely too strong for Celtic now. They&#39;re 15 points in front  and could easily win the title by 20 points or more.<br><br>&quot;That will  make it even harder for Celtic to attract the players they need. Both  halves of the Old Firm need to pay over the odds to bring foreigners to  Scotland but when Advocaat came he brought in top Dutchmen such as  Arthur Numan, Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Michael Mols.<br><br>&quot;They  were attracted by him as much as the contracts they were offered and, if  Kenny Dalglish doesn&#39;t take the coach&#39;s job, they need to appoint  someone with a reputation that will make top men want to play for them.<br><br>&quot;Celtic  certainly need to start signing better players than the ones they have  at present. They showed a complete lack of fight.&quot;<br><br>Gough, naturally enough, enjoyed his return to Ibrox.<br><br>He said: &quot;John Collins was in the Celtic end and we called him on the way back down to wind him up.<br><br>&quot;Big  Dave Watson was amazed at the great reception I got from the fans and I  felt proud and honoured by that. It&#39;s quite touching that people have  such good memories of you.<br><br>&quot;I also met up with Coisty, Craig Moore and Gordon Durie so it was quite a nostalgic occasion for me.&quot;<br><br>The Celtic fans will have felt quite differently.<br><br>On the day the Oscars were handed out, this was one particular movie they&#39;ve seen once too often.<br><br>Meanwhile, bookies have already installed Rangers as 1-3 favourites to win the SPL title NEXT SEASON.<br><br>The Ibrox men are certainties to cruise to their second championship in a row after Sunday.<br><br>However,  Glasgow bookies John Smith&#39;s are so certain Advocaat&#39;s men are going to  win the league again next season that they have quoted them at their  shortest pre-season price ever.<br><br>A spokesman said: &quot;All the  punters want to know about are the odds on Rangers winning the league  again and our figures reflect that.

He has been working on this strategy since his  club&#39;s agm last December when he outlined the club&#39;s future strategy and  I believe he is close to pulling off some major deals.<br><br>&quot;The  strategy involves bringing into play similar single-minded people who  have agreed with Murray&#39;s vision of the club&#39;s future but it is believed  these investors will only come on board provided Murray remains in  control.&quot;<br><br>Murray refused to be drawn on details of financial  changes planned but said: &quot;What I would say on fund-raising initiatives  is they will be purely optional on existing shareholders. I&#39;m the first  to accept and confirm that our supporters have given us everything  financially that it was fair and reasonable to ask of them in the past  but there is only so much they can give.<br><br>&quot;Next week I&#39;ll announce  a new policy on season tickets and European prices and I&#39;m sure the  majority of our supporters will be pleasantly surprised.&quot;<br><br>The  business community, however, are convinced Murray is about to take his  club into the big league by pulling off another coup like the Lewis deal  which staggered football at the time. They say this next one will have  even greater impact.<br><br>Murray added: &quot;I think our supporters expect and trust me to do something which can take us on to the next and higher level.<br><br>&quot;But that can&#39;t be done without extra and substantial funds as well as the football guidance of Advocaat.<br><br>&quot;There  are exciting times ahead for this club and if everything works out  Rangers will become one of the European game&#39;s major operations.<br><br>&quot;I  have worked on a high-risk strategy in the past with our debt  fluctuating between pounds 20m and pounds 40m but I said at our last agm  I didn&#39;t want that to continue.<br><br>&quot;I believe that we can take this  club on and Europe has always been my goal. I feel that with Dick and  the proper amounts of money it will be possible to make Rangers a team  to be reckoned with abroad.<br><br>&quot;We have made good progress already  in the brief time Dick has been with us and even only two years ago who  would have thought Rangers would beat Bayer Leverkusen and Parma, run  Bayern Munich very close and also beat Borussia Dortmund?<br><br>&quot;The  Scottish co-efficient has gone up, we have been scoring better than the  Dutch recently, although they are still higher than us. It is beginning  to happen for Rangers although there is a long way to go.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t believe, though, that this is a time for any of us to be gloating.<br><br>&quot;So far as Rangers are concerned we are just beginning but the future looks good at the moment.&quot;<br><br>Rangers  have already made significant moves to strengthen their squad by  securing AZ Alkmaar wing back Fernando Ricksen for pounds 4m and  Sunderland&#39;s Allan Johnston.<br><br>By the time the new season starts  Rangers will have added at least three more to their squad, which was  augmented during the season by the signings of Billy Dodds and Tugay.<br>COPYRIGHT 2000 Scottish Daily Record &amp; Sunday  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Hunter poised to invest in Rangers</h3><br><a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/football/Hunter-poised-to-invest-in.2233782.jp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/football/Hunter-poised-to-invest-in.2233782.jp</a><br>Published Date: 08 May 2000<br><br>By Ken Symon Business Editor<br>Tom   Hunter, the leading entrepreneur, is believed to be close to agreeing a   multi-million pound investment in Rangers as part of moves to  establish  the Scottish football club as a global brand.<br><br>Mr  Hunter is expected  to become closely involved in the future development  of Murray  International, the parent company of Rangers.

But Adam has   been a candid critic of the way Rangers have operated for years, ever   willing to voice his unease - indeed, his incomprehension - at losses he   has always insisted were unsustainable. <br><br>He also has impressive   credentials, having been chairman and managing director of Rangers   Development and Rangers Pools since 1971, raising the millions which   built the modern Ibrox. Adam&rsquo;s efforts brought the club around   &pound;18million, about &pound;60million at today&rsquo;s values. <br><br>To say that his   final severance with Ibrox, after three separate terms as a director   amounting to about 15 years of service, was done in a fury would be   inaccurate, but in conversation this week it became evident that his   decision is underpinned by unmistakable disgust. <br><br>Not given to   sensationalism, this essentially conservative disciple of prudent   forward planning and low-risk business principles did, however, cause   something of a shock by observing almost matter-of-factly that, if   Rangers continue on their present track, their ultimate destination will   be bankruptcy. <br><br>&quot;That&rsquo;s the logical conclusion to a strategy   that incurs serious loss year on year,&quot; said Adam. &quot;In the past five   years - and it&rsquo;s all there in the last annual report - Rangers have lost   &pound;80million. <br><br>&quot;Now, the banks are well known for being a bit  more  tolerant of companies whose core business is a popular pursuit  like  football. But there is a limit to how far backwards they can bend  to  accommodate you. <br><br>&quot;David Murray has always had an amazing   persuasiveness when it comes to getting people to put money into his   businesses, but the signs are that those sources have dried up. <br><br>&quot;The   &pound;40million worth of shares that ENIC (English National Investment   Company) bought a few years ago are now worth about &pound;15million, with no   evidence to suggest that they will recover. The money itself, that  which  was actually invested, was lost some time ago. <br><br>&quot;Now the  latest  investor, Dave King from South Africa, will know that his  &pound;20million  shareholding is worth around half, or even less, of what it  was when he  bought. No proper businessman will want to buy into that  kind of loss.&quot; <br><br>ADAM  sold 12,000 of his 59,000 shares last year  and the balance of 47,000  just recently. For the latter, he got &pound;1.15  each; three years ago, they  were valued at &pound;3.45. He is convinced  Rangers cannot trade their way out  of trouble, unless they gain access  to a league that will attract  higher-bracket income from TV. He was in  favour of the proposed Atlantic  League, involving the Old Firm and  clubs from Holland, Portugal and  other countries, but is extremely  sceptical of their chances of joining  the English Premiership. <br><br>He  is adamant that Rangers do not have  the customer base to improve their  financial standing through  merchandising. &quot;Rangers&rsquo; so-called global  appeal is a myth,&quot; he said.  &quot;When I was there, we did an exercise which  involved asking 50,000 fans  on the database to recommend a friend or a  relative abroad. <br><br>&quot;A  big response was expected - some were even  talking about getting 100,000  names - because everybody in Scotland  seems to know somebody abroad. <br><br>&quot;We  got back 2,800 names and  three-quarters of them didn&rsquo;t know they had  been nominated. It&rsquo;s no  surprise that Celtic are officially the  best-supported football club in  North America, with more official clubs  than anybody else. The  difference is the Irish connection. <br><br>&quot;Many  Irish people may  support Manchester United, Liverpool or whoever, but  they all - every  one of them - have an affection for Celtic. And, of  course, Celtic also  have a great Scottish following. <br><br>&quot;The  difference is that,  while the Irish all have an allegiance to Parkhead,  there are millions  of Scots who not only don&rsquo;t support Rangers, but  actively dislike them.  <br><br>&quot;Despite the claims of international  appeal, Rangers are,  essentially, a West of Scotland club. They talk of  supporters&rsquo; buses  leaving from all parts of Scotland, but if you look  closely, you&rsquo;ll see  there aren&rsquo;t many from each area and they are not  all full. <br><br>&quot;This  doesn&rsquo;t mean that even Celtic will earn fortunes  from emigrant  supporters. There may be more of them than Rangers fans,  but it doesn&rsquo;t  mount to the kind of income necessary to fund their  ambitions. But  Celtic have been, since Fergus McCann&rsquo;s arrival, much the  better-run  club. <br><br>&quot;Fergus was the most unjustly maligned man in  the history  of the game, when you consider that he took the club from  bankruptcy  into the mainstream and built that stadium along the way. <br><br>&lsquo;NOW,   the Celtic board have more financial heavyweights than Rangers, with   people like Brian Quinn, Dermot Desmond and Sir Patrick Sheehy. <br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s   only in the last couple of years that Celtic have sustained losses,  but  over the five-year period they break even. But Brian Quinn and his   board are taking steps to warn people that they are not in the business   of heading towards bankruptcy. <br><br>&quot;For their pains - for doing   their job properly - they get crucified in the media, accused of   penny-pinching. I don&rsquo;t understand it. <br><br>&quot;They are determined to   keep Celtic properly managed, while Rangers, with Murray, is a one-party   state and the man in power has an allergy to any form of personal   criticism. But he&rsquo;s not a businessman in the long-term sense of planning   and prudence, he&rsquo;s more of an impresario. <br><br>&quot;But what has been happening is unfair on shareholders, and they&rsquo;re being short-changed. <br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s a nonsense, too, to say that Rangers&rsquo; shareholders are all supporters who aren&rsquo;t interested in dividends or profits. <br><br>&quot;That&rsquo;s   okay for the man with 50 shares, framed and hung on his wall. The   number of shareholders in that category would amount to a minuscule   percentage of the equity. <br><br>&quot;But I&rsquo;m 76 and haven&rsquo;t had a dividend   in years, so what&rsquo;s the point of me keeping shares until they dwindle   to nothing? And I&rsquo;m certain the people at ENIC won&rsquo;t be too pleased  with  their investment.&quot;</div><br>                                                                        <ul class="viewarticle_info"><li>                           Last Updated:                             02 February 2002 12:00 AM                         </li><li>                                                         Source:                               The Scotsman                                                     </li><li>                           Location:                            Edinburgh                         </li></ul></div><div>                     <div class="headline"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Rangers to drop orange strip after sectarian outcry 	</h3><h2 class="meta"> 	Sunday Herald, The, Oct 6, 2002 | by Jenifer Johnston   	</h2>  Rangers are to scrap their controversial orange &quot;away&quot; football strip  at the end of this season. The decision is described by the club as  &quot;commercial rather than political&quot;. <br><br> The strip, officially  described as &quot;tangerine&quot; and was introduced in April, had triggered  furious debate over whether Rangers were profiting from their sectarian  overtones. <br><br> The decision comes ahead of today&#39;s Old Firm  encounter at Celtic Park, the first to be televised throughout the UK.  Rangers will be playing in their blue strip. <br><br> The decision has  been welcomed by politicians and anti- sectarianism campaigners. Donald  Gorrie, MSP, said: &quot;I think it is a very good gesture to drop the shirt.  I think it was a mistake on the part of Rangers to introduce it in the  first place - I don&#39;t think they thought through its implications.<br><div><div class="acc-content"><div class="element"> 		</div> 	</div> </div>  &quot;On the fringe of Old Firm supporters there are people imbued with  sectarian prejudices, but I believe both clubs are trying to work with  their fans to bring that to an end.&quot; <br><br> Online Rangers fanzines  have been urging supporters to wear the orange strip at today&#39;s match in  order to make a block of colour on the stands. <br><br> At the Rangers  annual general meeting earlier this week chairman John McClelland  admitted the strip was in fact &quot;orange&quot;, after months of the club  marketing it as &quot;tangerine&quot; in defiance of concerned anti- sectarian  campaigners. <br><br> A spokeswoman for the club told the Sunday Herald  that the decision to drop the tangerine shirt was &quot;a commercial  decision, not based on politics. We change the shirt every season with  new designs to try to make it new and fresh&quot;. <br><br> The shirt has  proved hugely popular with fans and was selling at a ratio of 60% to the  blue home strip. The club expects to sell 300,000 this season. <br><br>  Hardline Rangers supporters have been using unofficial Rangers web  fansites to stir sectarian hatred ahead of the match. One Ibrox fan on  the Follow Follow fansite says: &quot;Looking forward to seeing the away  corner in the Piggery decked out in tangerine shirts! The look on the  mhanky mhob&#39;s faces will be hilarious!&quot; Another said: &quot;We are the  people, f*** the Pope and the Vatican.&quot; <br><br> Rangers fans have been allocated just over 7000 of the 60,225 tickets for the match, which kicks off at 2.15pm. <br><br>  The anti-sectarian charity Nil By Mouth, said yesterday: &quot;This is a  step in the right direction. The orange strip has been seen by many as  contradictory of the good work done by Rangers in recent times against  sectarianism.&quot; <br><br> Alison Logan, of Sense Over Sectarianism, said  she considered the decision to drop the shirt &quot;a welcome move&quot;.                      <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>2002</h3><h3><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Pic" height="798" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/5oEDsFAyELuvBp0jLvoC-Q105216/GW295H798" title="Rangers - Pic" width="295"></h3><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Scotsman Alan Pautilo</h3><br><br>  MURRAY EYES 20TH PRIZE AND THEN THE WORLD<br> <br> IT IS a measure of David Murray&#39;s continued success at Rangers, that should the Ibrox side taste victory in the Scottish Cup final tomorrow, a fifth of the trophies the club has won in over 127 years of history will have been collected during his 11-year spell as chairman.<br> <br> Indeed, Saturday may prove a milestone for a club for whom records - they have justcompleted a league season an unprecedented 21 points ahead of their nearest title challengers - are becoming commonplace. Victory over Aberdeen will ensure the Ibrox trophy room of its 100th hunk of silver, and Murray of his 20th.<br> <br> This bald fact - more so than the recently announced 53 million pounds share rights investment, and the soon-to-berevealed major media deal - gives the Ibrox chairman utmost pleasure, as does the statistic that shows his manager and friend, Dick Advocaat has won five of six possible domestic trophies since his arrival here two years ago.<br> <br> <br> Their relationship has given Rangers a level of dynamism every Scottish club is struggling to cope with. Such synergy perhaps emphasises where indeed they are going wrong.<br> <br> Scour other club boardrooms, and you will not find a chairman-manager bondso strong. Certainly not at Celtic, where you sometimes wonder if chief executive Allan MacDonald, the Parkhead board and Director ofFootball/Interim head coach Kenny Dalglish have ever been in the same room together. And, at Dens Park you would notexpect to find the Marr brothers and Jocky Scott engaged inbanter -tossing over a bottle of Chianti, or Hearts pair Chris Robinson and Jim Jefferiesplotting a caravan tour of the Highlands together.<br> <br> While Advocaat and Murray are close socially, their relationship at Ibrox is never less than business-like. Advocaat targets the players, Murray signs the cheques. Or doesn&#39;t, as the case may be.<br> <br> The chairman recounts a favourite story involvingAdvocaat, one that underlines his &#39;Little General&#39; sobriquet. He and Advocaat have many discussions regarding players, and some talks are allowed to progress further than others. Murray recalled entertaining a potential purchase - a striker - in his Edinburgh office this time last year: &quot;We had agreed on everything. Then suddenly Dick phones me up, and says &#39;I have decided he is not good enough!&#39; I asked him if he was sure, because he is sitting in front of me. I had to sit there with this player and his representatives, and bring them round to thinking it was their idea not to come. That is what Dick is like. He is very intense. He does his homework.&quot;<br> <br> Such is Advocaat and his Dutch brethren&#39;s influence at the club, that Murray can see no harm in the controversial idea for fans to wear orange at Hampden tomorrow, despite the nefarious connections people will make and have done already.<br> <br> These &quot;Dutch&quot; strips are not being produced fast enoughto meet the demand, andHampden won&#39;t have seenanything like it since Dundee United last trundled into town. Murray believes it akin to Manchester United fans arriving at Old Trafford during the Eric Cantona era waving French tricolours.<br> <br> &quot;I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong in it and I will tell you why. We are clearly aScottish club, and it is an orange strip with a lion rampant. If we had not put that on it, then I could accept people going &#39;what&#39;s the story here?&#39;<br> <br> &quot;If people still want to interpret it any other way then that is their problem. Why are there Irish strips at Celtic matches? Has there ever been a bigger contingent of players from one foreign country at a club in Britain? Half the team will be Dutch next season, as well as the manager and his assistant. There is bound to be some association.&quot;<br> <br> Murray may not court controversy, but won&#39;t baulk from stirring it. His refusal to let Ibrox host the forthcoming Mike Tyson-Lou Saverese fight, now to be staged at Hampden, does not stem from any principled stand. The financial package offered was not acceptable.<br> <br> &quot;What Tyson did was wrong, but does that mean that any person of any celebrity status who has done something wrong won&#39;t be allowed into this country? Where do you draw the line? It&#39;s just people jumping on a bandwagon again. The government agreed to it. Who are we to sit and judge someone&#39;s morals?&quot;<br> <br> Celtic - who refused onethical grounds to host the fight - clearly believe such a responsibility is theirs, though fans of the club might wish they would concentrate on occupying the footballing high-ground.<br> <br> Murray, an obviously competitive man, must have some qualms regarding the ease with which Rangers claimed their tenth title in eleven years?<br> <br> &quot;It is not my concern,&quot; he replied, abruptly. &quot;But what I would say is it is a bloody tough job running a football club.<br> <br> &quot;I&#39;ve had defeat in Europe as other chairmen have had defeat by us in Scotland. It&#39;s not a nice feeling. It&#39;s bloody horrible.<br> <br> &quot;Stewart Milne has not gone into Aberdeen to get rich quick, he&#39;s there because he loves the club. Allan MacDonald is getting a hard time and he doesn&#39;t even own Celtic. He&#39;s just a hired hand and he&#39;s getting pelters. So I do have some sympathy, but with the greatest respect my job is to beat Celtic, just as it is to beat Hibs and Hearts.&quot;<br> <br> Murray conceded there is not 21 points between Rangers and Celtic this year: &quot;It should have been closer. But we got the breaks when we needed them. We are the better team, butI know Dick is not being complacent. We are further ahead than anybody in strengthening the team for next year.&quot;<br> <br> Rangers have already signed Fernando Ricksen and Allan Johnston and hope to add Feyenoord&#39;s Bert Konterman and Bolton&#39;s Paul Ritchie next week. A striker is also beingsought from a short-leet of seven. Celtic, meanwhile, have still to name a head coach who can then only begin such scouting.<br> <br> Yet you sense Murray&#39;s sights extend far beyond putting one over the east end of Glasgow. He rails against the parochialism of Scotland - &quot;we used to be such an expansive nation, but parochialism mixed withbigotry has been the downfall of this country&quot; - and now aims to take Rangers to the world, in a broadening of horizons such as Manchester United have achieved. His son, also David, has masterminded a takeover of Australian club Northern Spirit. It is only the beginning.<br> <br> &quot;There is nothing to stop us hopefully having three or four clubs, with our own world TV channel, playing in the same strip, with the same sponsor.&quot; The thought of there being four &quot;Rangers&#39;&quot; in the world might be enough to send many to the brink, but Murray is adamant each club will retain its own identity, and own name.<br> <br> Meanwhile at HQ Ibrox you can imagine the chairman and Advocaat, with white furry cats on laps, drinking a toast to the global march. Indeed, Holland, as Hampden will prove tomorrow, has already been taken.<br><br>Qasim Siddiquie<br> <br> Deutsche Bank AG<br> Risk Management<br> 17/19 Throgmorton Ave<br> (Garden House)<br> London EC2N 2JJ, United Kingdom<br> Tel: +44 20 754 19798<br> Email: <a href="mailto:qasim-s.siddiquie@db.com" target="_self">qasim-s.siddiquie@db.com</a><br><br><br> <br> ---<br> This e-mail may contain confidential and/or privileged information.

Please, don&#39;t all shoot me at once. It&#39;s  just  that David Murray, the chairman of Rangers, deserves praise for  his  recent activity at the club. Some people might know that I have not  been  an admirer of Murray. This stance was nothing personal but based  purely  on his policy at Ibrox. I always maintained that, having at  first been  good news, Murray soon became very bad news for Rangers. In  recent years  the fiscal damage done to Rangers due to Murray&#39;s reckless  ambition  meant that the club staggered under the strain of its  subsequent  &pound;75m-plus debt.<br><br>Of course, there was another reason  why my  smooching up to Murray in print wasn&#39;t required. Frankly, he has  enough  prominent poodles in the press who do that; journalists who,  for all  their bravado, have hardly dared write a critical column about  Murray in  their lives. We all know the deal: David, I won&#39;t write bad  things  about you if you will kindly drop the odd story in my lap. Just  about  every time you see a so-called &quot;Murray exclusive&quot; in print this  is the  deal behind it. Murray and his media pooches are famous for this  brand  of Winalot journalism. Having said all this, let me now give  credit  where credit is due. Whatever your view of David Murray, he has  never  wanted anything other than the best for Rangers. You may have  disagreed  with his stewardship at Ibrox &ndash; and this writer certainly has  &ndash; but  no-one should doubt that Murray has the best for Rangers at  heart.<br><br>Even  while I have been in dispute with Murray, to the  point where he has  tried to threaten me with legal action, I never  doubted this principle.  Today I often meet Rangers supporters who tell  me that Murray &quot;doesn&#39;t  care about the club&quot; and they seem to  automatically assume that I will  agree. Frankly, I couldn&#39;t disagree  more. Murray cares passionately  about Rangers. If you dispute this, you  obviously don&#39;t know him. Like  him or loathe him, he wants nothing but  success at Ibrox. It was  probably because of this that he took Rangers  near the brink of ruin.  Yet with the club now active once more in the  transfer market, it is  only fair to point out that only Murray has made  this possible. Without  Murray underwriting the Rangers rights-issue  with &pound;51m three months ago,  none of Alex McLeish&#39;s current wheeling and  dealing would be happening.  In other words, Murray, in going out on  yet another financial limb,  rectified much of the damage inflicted by  his dreaming.<br><br>In  effect, he absorbed into his own company,  Murray MHL, a huge tranch of  Rangers&#39; debt which had been hampering the  club. Of course, Murray was  responsible for creating that debt in the  first place, but having  criticised him for that, you cannot ignore his  rescue act. Without that  Murray intervention, none of McLeish&#39;s new  faces would be arriving at  Ibrox. The net of &pound;6.5m received from  Newcastle United for Jean-Alain  Boumsong would have gone directly  towards reducing Rangers&#39; debt. There  would have been no Thomas Buffel  or Sotirios Kyrgiakos arriving at  Ibrox. <br><br>The best example of  all concerns the imminent return of  Barry Ferguson. This certainly  wouldn&#39;t be happening without Murray&#39;s  recent action. Not only could  debt-ridden Rangers not afford to raise  money to bring Ferguson back,  but the club most certainly couldn&#39;t have  written off the &pound;2.5m still  owed by Blackburn for Ferguson&#39;s transfer.  Freedom of expression is  allowed, isn&#39;t it? If I regard Murray as  posturing and vainglorious, I  can say it, can&#39;t I? If I think he enjoys  milking Rangers&#39; &quot;superiority  syndrome&quot;, as Walter Smith once put it, I  can say that, too, can&#39;t I?  Just as, today, I believe Murray deserves  praise.</div></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <h3>2008</h3><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Miscellaneous articles - Kerrydale Street" height="598" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/HBAgBgZJHJobZnZ-NVIw2A73017/GW308H598" title="Rangers - Miscellaneous articles - Kerrydale Street" width="308"><br><br><br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h2>2009</h2><h3>    Glenn Gibbons: Reminisces of past Rangers &#39;battles&#39; do not bear scrutiny</h3><h3>Published Date: 05 December 2009 (The Scotsman)<br></h3>IF,  AS LP Hartley suggested, the past is a foreign country where things are  done differently, perhaps it only appears that way because people often  look at it with a squint.  When, for example, the former Rangers  captain, Richard Gough, reflected this week on the Ibrox side&#39;s European  exploits during his time with the club, he drew a picture that would be  unrecognisable to many of those who shared the experience.<br> <br> The  main thrust of Gough&#39;s musing was a then-and-now comparison of the  respective Rangers team&#39;s physical and mental fortitude, with the  present-day representatives taking some serious flak over their  wimpishness in the recent Champions League campaign which saw them lose  three successive home matches while conceding ten goals.<br> <br> Gough  was particularly animated by a quote from Alexander Hleb, the Belarus  midfielder who was the most accomplished player on the field during a  2-0 victory for Stuttgart in which Rangers were so comprehensively  outplayed that the margin of defeat might have been trebled. Hleb  expected a rough-and-tumble, perhaps even brutal, match and was  surprised to leave the field without so much as a minor knock. Gough  insisted, in his day, this would have been considered totally  unacceptable.<br> <br> He illustrated his argument quite colourfully,  saying that Hleb would have been &quot;black and blue&quot; and that &quot;in my day,  our mindset was that if they (opponents) came into the area, they will  get hurt.&quot;<br> <br> Curiously, despite involvement in all of Rangers&#39;  milestone matches of the period, this (admittedly ageing) columnist has  no memory of any Juventus player hobbling wounded from the field after  an 8-1 aggregate victory in group matches &ndash; 4-1 in Turin, 4-0 in Glasgow  &ndash; in 1995.<br> <br> Nor is there any recollection of the mass  evacuation of casualties the following year, when Ajax (5-1) and even  Auxerre (4-2) beat Rangers home and away and Grasshoppers&#39; opening 3-0  win in Zurich left the Scottish champions with five defeats and bottom  of the section with three points from six matches for the second  successive season. Should the current squad take a point from their trip  to Seville on Wednesday, they will match those &quot;achievements&quot;.<br> <br>  Failure to qualify for the group stage on the back of defeats by  Gothenburg, AEK Athens and Levski Sofia and a first-round elimination by  Sparta Prague add up to six embarrassing campaigns from the seven  attempts during Walter Smith&#39;s first managerial tenure, the period in  which Gough and the players whose toughness he eulogised could be said  to have been in their prime.<br> <br> Whatever else Gough&#39;s so-called fighting men may have accomplished, they didn&#39;t seem to leave much blood on the carpet.<br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <br><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - 1969 Newcastle story" height="1600" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/uZ1bQs2OYSXScgfbgRFkzQ1636170/GW1111H1600" title="Rangers - 1969 Newcastle story" width="1111"><br><br><br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   <br><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - 1996 Dream Team" height="1165" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/UKmhsfNSf60A6FcrtzoBrw323939/GW874H1165" title="Rangers - 1996 Dream Team" width="874"><br><br><br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   The Scotsman newspaper (with some classic sycophancy)<br><div> <div> <div class="headline"><h3> Long-term player David Murray in no hurry to offload prized asset so close  to his heart</h3></div> <div class="subheadline"> </div> </div> <div> <div> <div class="priemiumbox noborder"> <div class="paddingpremium"> <div class="leftpremium"> </div>Published Date: 16 June 2010 </div></div></div> <div> <div class="byline">By Alan Pattullo (16 June 2010)</div>   <div class="ds-firstpara">WHEN  Rangers set about defending their  title next season, they could do  worse than take a lesson from the club&#39;s owner  on how to retain a  prized possession. </div> <div class="va-bodytext">There have been  enough hints in the past  seven months to suggest that Sir David Murray  was, after all, far from hellbent  on allowing Rangers to pass out of  his hands into the clutches of those he  deemed less than suitable. <br><br>  ss was taking so long was one fairly obvious  indicator. A more subtle  pointer was his reported anger at suggestions last week  that a deal  with a group led by long-time suitor Andrew Ellis had been  completed,  which would see him gain just over half the &pound;6 million sum he paid  for  Rangers in 1989. One newspaper report was detailed enough to talk of  this  happening by noon last Friday. Murray, who was in Sheffield on  other business  last week when he heard of this apparent deadline, had,  according to one source,  &quot;only just stopped laughing by then&quot;. <br><i><br>Murray  is a survivor, for sure.  But he is also careful with what he owns. He  is treating Rangers like the  bottles of fine wine that are maturing in  one of his cellars in Burgundy. There  is no need to rush anything. The  readiness is all. With a love of the cut and  thrust of the business  world, he is more than prepared to get his hands dirty  again. Indeed,  it was only ever a possibility that he would sell Rangers. It was  one  that, in the present financial climate, had to be considered slender  indeed.  And given Murray&#39;s history with Rangers, given his emotional  ties, the  possibility was reduced to a sliver. All down the line there  have been clues  that Rangers would begin next season with not just  Walter Smith in charge, but  also Murray in as firm control as ever. </i><br><br>We  only need to refer back to  what was said in October last year, when  the club was formally placed on the  market. &quot;It is not necessarily  about price, but the new owner having the  capability to take the club  forward that remains essential,&quot; formed part of the  statement on the  club&#39;s official website. Even yesterday&#39;s statement, made to  the Stock  Exchange at 5.30pm, included a reminder of this salient fact: the club   was for sale, but this didn&#39;t mean there would necessarily be a  transaction to  follow.<br><br>Indeed, MIH (Murray International  Holdings] had advised that this  &quot;may or may not lead to it disposing of  some or all of its majority share in the  club to a third party&quot;. In  addition, Murray&#39;s original statement to the board in  October had  emphasised that MIH would only consider options to sell, should they   emerge.<br><br>It&#39;s clear Murray did mean to sell Rangers. But, as he  emphasised  again and again, both in private and in public, there was  no-one out there  rushing to take the form of a white knight, no Dubai  property magnates willing  to plough millions into the club. And even  had there been, Murray had outlined  from the start that he had to be  assured such characters had Rangers&#39; best  interests at heart. <br><br>In  reality, the only ones showing interest were  limping like mangy dogs  towards Ibrox. The sniffing around had to stop  eventually. Murray put  an end to it last night, although, again, the wording has  to be  acknowledged. MIH, the statement said, is no longer &quot;actively marketing   its controlling stake in the club for sale&quot;, but Murray will remain  open to  offers. In effect, little has changed, except for Ellis&#39;  removal from the  equation. <br><br>While, for some, the announcement  made to the Stock Exchange  last week on behalf of Ellis&#39; company RFC  Holdings &ndash; saying only that the  company was in &quot;advanced negotiations&quot;  to buy a controlling interest in Rangers  &ndash; offered an impression of  something about to happen in terms of a buy-out,  others were right to  interpret it as little more than a death rattle on the part  of the  London-based property dealer.<br><br>There is a difference between being   diligent and being dilatory. Ellis, as the announcement made clear  last week,  was not even at the stage of making a formal offer, after  months of apparent  courtship. Had he been trying to buy a house he  would have been kicked into  touch long ago by the frustrated selling  party.<br><br><i>The surprise is that  anybody could be surprised by the  turn of events last night, given Murray&#39;s  record. He has a talent for  rejuvenation and has stormed back into the fray  before. In August 2004,  on the back of some worrying financial figures, Murray  returned to  Ibrox as chairman, having two years earlier stepped down. He  increased  his share-holding from 65 per cent to 86 per cent, and was  re-installed  as chairman. <br></i><br>The Rangers Supporters Trust gave a cautious   response to this news then. The Ibrox supporters might be equally  underwhelmed  this time around. But no-one can deny Murray is a battler,  nor that he is  unconcerned about the future of Rangers. The club push  on with him very much on  board &ndash; as champions, it must be recalled. Nor  has Murray lost his taste for the  invigorating scent of success.<br><br>TAKEOVER TALKS  TIMELINE<br><br>26 Aug 2009: Sir David Murray announces he is to step  down as Rangers chairman and board member.<br><br>25 Oct: Rangers confirm they  have received &quot;tentative enquiries&quot; about the sale of the club but no formal  offers.<br><br>26 Oct: Lloyds Bank deny they are running Rangers.<br><br>12 Nov:  Rangers annual report shows their debts have risen &pound;10m to &pound;31m.<br><br>6  Mar  2010: Rangers confirm Murray is &quot;considering options&quot; regarding  his shareholding  following reports a consortium headed by London-based  property developer Andrew  Ellis is preparing a takeover offer.<br><br>8  Mar: Rangers confirm Murray is in  takeover talks with &quot;certain  interested parties&quot;, including Ellis, that &quot;may  lead to an offer or  offers for the entire issued share capital of the  club&quot;.<br><br>3 May:  Ellis claims that if his reported takeover bid of  &pound;33million goes  through, he will give Smith a new contract and offer the role of  life  president to Murray.<br><br>25 May: Murray and Ellis meet &ndash; and later the  same day the club announces it has agreed a new business plan with the  bank.<br><br>15 June: Taken off market.<br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>   </div></div></div></div>From The Sunday Times  <div class="float-right text-right position-relative margin-top-minus-20">      </div> <div class="small color-666"> May 18, 2008  </div><h3>  Who were the fans that shamed Rangers? </h3><h2 class="sub-heading padding-top-5 padding-bottom-15">Scottish   football has worked hard to shed its hooligan image, so what kind of   supporter would want to be behind the scenes in Manchester this week?</h2>    <div> <div class="article-author">   Stuart MacDonald   </div> </div>     <div><br><div>    The build-up to the match promised a carnival atmosphere - Rangers in  a  European final was a rarity and the tens of thousands of fans who  packed the  stadium were determined to make the most of it. With the sun  shining and  Scottish football in the ascendancy after a long period of  underachievement,  there was a sense of expectancy.    Yet before the  final whistle had blown, things had started to go wrong. With  Rangers  losing, their drunk fans became restive. Booing and bottle-throwing   began.    Vehicles were overturned as police moved in to quell the  violence. Arrests  were made and what began as a festival of football  became another example of  Scotland&#39;s shame.    <br><br><br>This was not  last week in Manchester - it was 47 years ago in Glasgow when  Rangers  played Fiorentina in the first finalof the European Cup Winners&#39;  Cup.  Plus &ccedil;a change, as they say in France, although it&#39;s doubtful the   French will be volunteering to host a football match involving Rangers  any  time soon.     Last week&#39;s UEFA Cup final prompted the kind of  scenes most Scots thought had  been consigned to the bank of bad 1970s  memories, along with the three-day  week and Ford Capris. Not since the  days of inebriated fans with feather  cuts and flares collapsing the  Wembley posts and baton wielding mounted  police charging across the  Hampden turf has Scotland been so shamed.    It should have been an  occasion to cherish. Instead, it will be remembered for  feral gangs of  fans in pitched battles with riot police, cars being trashed,  shops  smashed and looted, terrified residents cowering in the face of the   mindless, rampaging onslaught. <br><br>A Russian fan was stabbed six  times, lucky to  escape alive.    However, the defining image of the  evening will be the sight of braying,  primal louts descending on PC  Mick Regan like a &ldquo;pack of wolves&rdquo;, raining  kicks and blows on his head  and body without mercy or heed for his life.    That he didn&#39;t suffer  more serious injury was down only to luck and  determination to escape.  Witness John Spencer watched a group of Rangers  fans attack a car as  the female occupant cowered inside.    &ldquo;They were kicking and punching  to try and get the windows in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They  were ripping off her  wing mirrors and she was terrified. I was concerned  that if they got  into the car they could have seriously injured or killed  her.&rdquo;   <br><br>Donna  McNeill, 22, a bar worker at Manchester&#39;s Waldorf hotel, said: &ldquo;They   were banging around, screaming and helping themselves to the beer. At  one  stage we stopped serving because it was getting out of hand, but  they turned  round and said you better serve us or we&#39;ll turn the place  over and trash  the pub.    As the dust settled in Manchester city  centre and the broken glass and empty  beer cans were swept up,  politicians and club officials were quick to  condemn the &ldquo;minority&rdquo;.     <br><br>They were not genuine Rangers fans, officials insisted, but had  attached  themselves to the club. Gordon Brown branded the rioters a  &ldquo;disgrace&rdquo; and  Rangers chairman David Murray pledged to weed out the  troublemakers and ban  them from Ibrox.    However, there are those who  claim the events of last week merit more than  condemnation and promises  of swift action. They think the Glasgow club has a  problem with  hooliganism and sectarianism which has not been addressed and,  until it  is, there is the risk of such events being repeated.    What was not  explained is who are the troublemakers, if not Rangers fans? From  where  did they emerge and who do they represent? And crucially, why was   there no intelligence to stop them showing up in Manchester and turning  the  city into a war-zone?    <br><br>Rangers have a track record of  similar behaviour when playing abroad - their  last European final in  Barcelona in 1972, which they won, was marred by fans  invading the  pitch and fighting running battles with Spanish police.    Disorder  occurred at Rangers games in Wolverhampton and Newcastle during the   1960s. Four years after their European success, the club&#39;s fans were   involved in a riot in Birmingham following a friendly against Aston  Villa.    <br><br>&ldquo;Historically, Rangers fans have caused problems when  they have travelled to  games in England, there&#39;s a track record,&rdquo; says  Bert Moorhouse, a  sociologist at Glasgow University and an expert on  football hooliganism.    &ldquo;Different generations of football fans are not  the same people but a way of  behaving gets passed down.&rdquo;   There has  been no serious public disorder at matches involving the Scotland   national team for the past 30 years and the Tartan Army is now welcomed   throughout the world.    During the same period, English fans gained a  reputation as some of the most  violent in the world, clashing with  police in Sweden in 1992 and France in  1998. In 1995 a friendly match  between England and Ireland in Dublin was  abandoned because of crowd  trouble and during Euro 2000, 800 England fans  were arrested following  riots in Charleroi, Belgium.    <br><br><br>Professor Eric Dunning, who  has written four books on football hooliganism,  said: &ldquo;In recent years  Scottish supporters have taken it upon themselves to  behave better when  abroad because they wanted to look better than the  English.     &ldquo;However, Rangers have a long history of hooliganism. The Billy Boys  were the  first football hooligan gang.    &ldquo;I think what we saw the  other night is the continuation of an old problem.&rdquo;    He added: &ldquo;I  think it is a myth to say that football hooliganism is not still  going  on in Scotland. It is just less obvious now as it happens away from  the  grounds and doesn&#39;t attract the media coverage that it once did.&rdquo;   <br><br>DESPITE  the ongoing Old Firm rivalry, Celtic appears to have made greater   strides in banishing hooliganism. The last time its supporters were  involved  in serious disorder was during a match at Burnley in 1978.     When the club reached the UEFA Cup Final in 2003, 80,000 fans travelled  to  Seville to watch the match against Porto. Despite the Glasgow side  losing  3-2 after extra time, there was no crowd trouble and the club  won a fair  play award for the behaviour of their fans.    <br><br>Dougie  Brimson,a former football hooligan turned author, was with a group of   Zenit St Petersburg supporters at the Rangers match.    &ldquo;I think the  Rangers fans were so determined to make it bigger and better than  the  Celtic fans did in Seville,&rdquo; he said.    &ldquo;One of the great tragedies is  that the Tartan Army, who worked so hard to  turn round their reputation  and are now welcomed wherever they go, will be  damaged by this.    &ldquo;It  just shows that the mindset of some people who follow football has not   changed and hooliganism still exists. <br><br>It&#39;s largely invisible  now compared  with 20 years ago because of the policing surrounding  games, but all things  associated with the scene - the clothes, the  hatred, the travel - are still  there and it can still kick off.&rdquo;   Nil  by Mouth,the antisectarian pressure group, said it was concerned that   bigoted chants could clearly be heard from a section of the Rangers  support,  undermining the club&#39;s attempts to eliminate the problem. <br><br>&ldquo;The  evidence over the course of this season is clear that bigotry remains a   significant problem in Scottish football and far too many incidents  are  being left unchallenged,&rdquo; said a spokesman.    Because of the  scenes of disorder, plans to erect open-air screens in  Manchester for  fans to watch this week&#39;s Champions League final have been  cancelled. A  proposed victory parade, if Manchester United defeat Chelsea,  has also  been scrapped.    While nobody condones the behaviour of the hooligans,  there has been criticism  of the city council for failing to prepare  properly for the arrival of such  a large number of fans and to allow  them to continue drinking throughout the  day.    <br><br>Jim Templeton,  president of the Rangers Assembly, which represents supporters  at club  board meetings, said there was a hardcore element which followed the   club, but he insisted the majority of fans were well behaved.    He  said: &ldquo;Like every big club, Rangers has an element of support that the  club  would not want to be affiliated with. <br><br>&ldquo;These people might call themselves Rangers supporters but they are not. They  are nothing short of animals.  </div></div>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>     From The Sunday Times   October 26, 2008   <h3>Sean Fallon condemns Jock Stein sex slur</h3>   The former assistant to the late Celtic manager says the campaign  against him is &lsquo;absurd and offensive&rsquo;  Stuart MacDonald   THE former  assistant to Jock Stein has spoken out against a campaign suggesting the  late Celtic manager ignored the sexual abuse of boys at the club during  the 1960s and 70s.   Sean Fallon, who worked with Stein for nearly 30  years, said it was &ldquo;absurd and offensive&rdquo; to suggest Stein, the first  British manager to win the European Cup, knew members of the Celtic Boys  Club were being systematically abused by a coach.   <br><br>The  allegations have been made by Rangers supporters, who have sung the  slogan &ldquo;Big Jock Knew&rdquo; at matches, held up banners and posted videos  featuring the taunts on the internet. The campaign has grown in  popularity since attempts to nominate Stein for a posthumous knighthood.    The taunts refer to child sex abuse charges for which the former  boys&rsquo; club manager, James Torbett, was found guilty and imprisoned.  Torbett&rsquo;s crimes were uncovered in 1996 when former footballer Alan  Brazil revealed that he had been molested at the age of 13 at Torbett&rsquo;s  home in Sighthill, Glasgow. Torbett was found guilty on charges of  shameless and indecent conduct with three juveniles between October 1967  and March 1974.<br><br>In 1998 he was jailed for two-and-a-half years.    None of Torbett&rsquo;s victims or their parents reported his crimes to the  police at the time. He was dismissed from the club by Stein in 1974  after rumours about his behaviour.   Fallon, 86, insisted Stein, the  former Scotland manager who died of a heart attack in 1985, had no idea  about Torbett&rsquo;s behaviour and said he was removed from the club as soon  as it came to light.   &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no truth to any of this at all,&rdquo; he  said. <br><br>&ldquo;Torbett was put out of the club. Jock wouldn&rsquo;t have  anything like that happening, particularly with young boys.&rdquo;   Fallon  said Rangers FC should take firm action against the fans involved.   &ldquo;A  lot of Rangers fans are good people . . . Rangers Football Club have  done everything in their power to sort it out and there was talk about  not letting people like that into their games. I know it is going to  very difficult but they should be stopped from going in.   &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  disappointing for the club that they represent [it] because they are not  looked upon as individuals, they are looked upon as Rangers supporters .  . . unfortunately, some humans are like that, no matter how great you  are they try and pull you down. These people should think about Jock&rsquo;s  family.&rdquo;   Last November, Peter Lawwell, Celtic&rsquo;s chief executive,  called the campaign &ldquo;poisonous, repugnant and cowardly&rdquo;.   Last week  club sources said they would be monitoring clips featuring the slogan on  the YouTube website.<br><br>This month, Rangers chairman Sir David  Murray condemned supporters of the club who engaged in spouting &ldquo;bile&rdquo;  at games and on websites.   A spokesman for Rangers said: &ldquo;The club has  made enormous strides in tackling sectarianism and bitterly opposes any  form of discriminatory or antisocial behaviour.&rdquo;   A Celtic spokesman  said it did not want to comment on the campaign.

Madness. Financial self-flagellation. Why not just put your &pound;100 notes in a shredder and save a bit of time?<br><br>Of  course, given the lottery win, I would probably be certified insane in  that department just like the rest of the fruitcakes through history who  have bled themselves dry over the love affair of the local footballing  institution.<br><br>We should all be locked up in another kind of institution actually.<br><br>It&#39;s  twenty years since David Murray bought himself a piece of the action.  Two decades since his pal Graeme Souness tipped him off that Rangers  were up for grabs and that just &pound;6 million would clinch the deal.<br><br>It  was a shrewd piece of business to persuade Lawrence Marlborough to walk  away. You certainly don&#39;t get much for &pound;6 million these days.<br><br>Of  course the running costs can be a little excessive. Murray freely  admits to pumping in a further &pound;100m just to keep the club ticking over.<br><br>Rangers chairman David Murray<br><br>Murray  - now Sir David of course - has picked up more than a knighthood along  the way. He is an international businessman and Rangers are just a piece  of his global jigsaw.<br><br>Or &quot;ten per cent of my business, 90 per cent of my grief&quot; as he likes to put it.<br><br>I  like the man - a heinous crime in the eyes of some observers who see me  and various colleagues as his lap dogs. Apparently the canine parallel  for interviewers should be Rottweilers.<br><br>Over the years he has  been accused of much nonsense, including asset stripping - a difficult,  never mind illegal, concept given that he actually owns 90 per cent of  the club.<br><br>At various times he has been lambasted for not spending  enough on players or spending too much, highlighted of course by his  b&ecirc;te noir when the sorcerer Dick Advocaat wooed him into believing Tore  Andre Flo was worth &pound;12 million.<br><br>To paraphrase Bill Shankly, ten million wouldn&#39;t buy him and I&#39;m one of them.<br><br>But  then again Murray massaged a deal for Alain Boumsong, a transfer which  was to cough profit the likes of which usually only comes with six  numbers and a bonus ball.<br><br>I cannot, for the life of me, fathom  the reluctance of a percentage of the Rangers support to embrace his  stewardship of the club.<br><br>No chairman has served longer, no other has witnessed such a sustained period of success.<br><br>Only  in the wake of the Ibrox disaster did the stadium undergo more surgery,  but after a century and more he became the first chairman to actually  do something about the alarming absence of a training facility worthy of  the name.<br><br>From the day of my first by-line I preached and  recorded the lunacy of both Rangers and Celtic&#39;s determination not to  have a training ground and youth academy and continue to work their  players in various car parks, public pitches and glorified allotments  where dog mess was as big a threat to their well being as a straight  legged tackle.<br><br>Men of vision? In the sixties and seventies there  were directors at Ibrox and Parkhead who couldn&#39;t have seen their own  reflection in the boardroom table.<br><br>And think on this: Murray Park cost twice his initial investment in the club.<br><br>He  blew away a century of signing policy which should have been banished  with the slave trade and dragged swathes of the club&#39;s support screaming  and kicking into the real world.<br><br>We still have bigots supporting  Rangers, but the club doesn&#39;t privately condone them anymore. And for  all the Famine Song nonsense, progress has been made in those twenty  years.<br><br>I came out of the front door at Ibrox when Mo Johnston  signed and watched so-called supporters rip up season tickets and burn  red, white and blue scarves.<br><br>In the days that followed there may  even have been Old Firm games with more Catholics in the Rangers team  than in Celtic&#39;s. Possibly, possibly not, but the point is that few  would even bother to work it out.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t matter...and that is breathtaking progress.<br><br>Murray should enjoy his anniversary celebrations. Twenty years is a long time in the job and for sure he won&#39;t repeat the shift.<br><br>They will miss him when he&#39;s gone.

Walter Smith&rsquo;s team, going  into  Sunday&rsquo;s Co-operative Insurance Cup final as underdogs, won quite a  few  admirers for their gritty 2-1 win over Celtic.<br><br>Alas, no one who   was at Hampden Park as a neutral, and who had any understanding of the   type of songs that were being sung, could have found anything remotely   appealing in the antics of the Rangers support.<br><br>For fully 120 minutes the Ibrox legions belted out stuff about the Pope, Fenians, and some of their other favoured subjects.<br><br>Quite   a few of us have become used to &ldquo;the Rangers problem&rdquo; over the years   but Sunday at Hampden was still quite an eye-opener. It was the   consistent, incessant nature of the bigoted chanting that was truly   shocking.<br><br>One of the problems we have in tackling bigotry in  Scottish  football is the sheer ignorance of the subject that we have to  put up  with. For instance, Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish Justice  Secretary,  clearly didn&rsquo;t have a clue what he was talking about, to  judge from the  fatuous statement he released after attending the match  at Hampden.<br><br>After  the prejudiced chants had boomed out, the  following was MacAskill&rsquo;s  take on the whole spectacle. &ldquo;This was the  showpiece everyone wanted to  see &mdash; it was a great advert for Scottish  football,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The  players, management and fans contributed to a  memorable occasion, and I  urge that their positive example inside the  ground is replicated outside  it over the course of the evening and  beyond. Football is a force for  good in society.&rdquo;<br><br>Given the  nature of what was chanted inside  Hampden, this was an utterly  ludicrous statement. MacAskill, clearly, is  totally unfamiliar with the  sort of problems given an airing at Hampden  if he thinks that the sort  of chanting which the Rangers fans kept up  apace represented &ldquo;fans  contributing to a memorable occasion.&rdquo; This is  risible.<br><br>I didn&rsquo;t  expect a Rangers statement yesterday on the  shocking tone of their  supporters&rsquo; singing, and nor was one forthcoming.  Rangers&rsquo; preferred  position on their problem is this: let&rsquo;s just have a  general media  silence on the subject, and let&rsquo;s keep any fuss to a  minimum. From  Rangers&rsquo; point of view, the fewer headlines there are  about their  problem, the less need there is of any requirement to act.<br><br>But   that is a tough scenario to hope for. The Ibrox club have already been   censured by Uefa over bigotry, and more than that, a number of Rangers   supporters&rsquo; songs have specifically been banned by European football&rsquo;s   governing body. So it is asking a lot for every newspaper to turn a   blind eye (or deaf ear) towards songs which have repeatedly been   outlawed.<br><br>What is more galling for those who want to be rid of  this  poison is the seeming ignorance &mdash; such as was revealed by  MacAskill &mdash; or  inability in government or police circles to be able to  fix it.<br><br>Hampden  on Sunday rang out to bigoted chanting from the  Rangers end, yet the  police statistics for &ldquo;sectarian-related crimes&rdquo;  were paltry, never mind  MacAskill&rsquo;s absurd words about how wonderful it  all was.<br><br>This isn&rsquo;t  government action. On the contrary, this is  inaction, and even  incompetence. The truth is, we are getting nowhere  today with the  problem of sectarianism in football. In fact, we are  regressing,  Edinburgh summits or not, at an alarming rate.<br><br>Rangers,  in trying to  fight their own specific problem, have lost ground.  Indeed, if you were  at Hampden on Sunday, with bigoted chant after  chant ringing out, you  would think that the club had gone back ten  years in their quest to  solve the problem. And for many others,  meanwhile, it actually means  very little.<br><br>OK, so there is  sectarian chanting, they say. So what?  What does it matter? Just let it  go, let&rsquo;s just concentrate on the  football.<br><br>Rangers lack the guts to truly take on their own support on the issue, and the same applies for the Scottish FA.<br><br>The   docking of points really would force the bigots to stop their  chanting,  and the SFA has the power to do this, but it is too scared  to.<br><br>Meanwhile,  too many other people won&rsquo;t touch this problem  with a bargepole,  claiming the accompanying aggro that comes with such  debate simply isn&rsquo;t  worth it.<br><br>So Scotland just goes on living with its embarrassing bigotry problem. Ignorance, incompetence and cowardice ensure it.<br>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>     2011</h3><h3> Matt Dickinson Chief Sports Correspondent The Times</h3>  Match: http://www.thecelticwiki.com/page/2011-04-24%3A+Rangers+0-0+Celtic%2C+SPL<br><br>  It  was the game of zero tolerance against sectarianism, when police   snatch  squads would target troublemakers at Ibrox in the aftermath of   the  bomb sent to Neil Lennon, the Celtic manager.<br><br> A day when  Rangers and  Celtic would stand united against any form of  bigotry or  intolerance  and instruct their supporters to focus on the  football.  Enough was,  finally, enough.<br><br> So what did Rangers do? They allowed a small Union Jack flag to be placed in every seat of a home supporter.<br><br> There were 40,000 of these flags, supplied by the Rangers Supporters Assembly, and every one approved by the club hierarchy.<br><br>   I rang Rangers yesterday to ask why, exactly? The Union Jack is not an    official symbol of Rangers FC. It is not part of the club badge, not  on   the shirt. It is not to be found on any page of the Rangers  website.<br><br>  A shirty spokesman, dismissing the inquiry as a  nonsense, said that it   was the flag of his country and the British  Isles. But there are dozens   of British clubs and none of the others  ever hand out Union Jacks.<br><br> If Rangers wanted to give the team a show of support, why not simply hand out regular club flags and scarves?<br><br>   Why endorse a provocative symbol of tribalism, on the very day when   both  clubs were meant to be going out of their way to calm their fans?<br><br>   The spokesman could not wait to get off the phone, although, before he    did so, he pointed out that Rangers had no intention of complaining    about the tricolours flown by the Celtic supporters. As if that made    everything all right.<br><br> Apologists will say that the Union Jack is   only a flag, a common one,  and not an incitement to send parcel bombs   to football managers. But it  has nothing whatsoever to do with   football.<br><br> In the context of the Old Firm, it has been hijacked  as a  sign of  lasting enmity, of division, entrenching the idea that  one  club, for now  and evermore, will represent the Protestant sector  of  Glasgow and the  other the Catholic.<br><br> One club handing out  Union  Jacks cannot possibly take us any closer to  the day, however far  away  it may be, when Rangers against Celtic becomes  a &ldquo;normal&rdquo;  sporting  rivalry, defined by geography, not historical or  religious  baggage.<br><br>  A day when the Old Firm becomes like Red against Blue,  City against   United, Milan against Inter, rather than the poisonous  stirring of an   ancient religious divide.<br> The bomb intended for  Lennon has focused  attention on the murderous  imbeciles, but there  will always be  extremists. The battle is surely  more importantly won  over the centre  ground, the reasonable majority.<br><br> This is the  job of driving sense  into the &ldquo;90-minute bigots&rdquo; as they  were  described in 2005 by Lawrence  Macintyre, the head of safety for   Rangers at the time, when he talked  of fans with Catholic friends and   workmates who became filled with  hatred on a Saturday afternoon at   Ibrox.<br><br> &ldquo;If we can get the person  that doesn&rsquo;t mean it then  we&rsquo;ll isolate the  real racists and real  bigots in numbers that are  manageable to deal  with,&rdquo; he said.<br> Does anyone seriously believe that the best means of education is for Rangers to hand out Union Jacks?<br><br>   To make such a point to the club yesterday was to be brushed off like   an  idiot. But then I met the same dismissiveness when I went to my  only   Old Firm derby at Ibrox a few years ago and expressed amazement  that a   giant Union Jack was being waved in the centre circle before  kick-off.<br><br> It seemed bizarre then and, given the tensions around Lennon, the ritual seemed even more extraordinary on Sunday.<br><br>   There seems to be an acceptance that these two clubs will always    represent a sectarian divide, and the best that can be done is to    contain the worst violence and the worst chanting rather than to    eradicate the problem altogether.<br><br> But it has to be asked whether   such an approach will ever make  sufficient progress. Many   well-intentioned campaigns and initiatives  have been launched in recent   years, only to founder.<br><br> The charity Nil by Mouth was  established  after the 1995 murder of a  young Celtic fan, Sense Over  Sectarianism, a  joint-initiative, was  launched in 2001, and Jack  McConnell, then the  First Minister, brought  together a summit in 2005  that led to tougher  legislation. Alex Salmond,  the First Minister says  the anti-sectarian  laws will be toughened  further in the coming  months.<br><br> We can add the  Pride over Prejudice campaign launched  by Rangers, Bhoys  against  Bigotry by Celtic and Bigger than Bigotry.  No doubt there are  others.<br><br>  The treatment of Lennon, the victim  of a street attack in Glasgow in  the  past as well as having the  threat made on his life, suggests that  this  problem is no closer to  being resolved and that the clubs have to  take a  stronger lead.  Condemning bombers is the easy part.<br><br> Rangers will insist that they do plenty, but that has not been the impression given in the past 48 hours, on or off the record.<br>  <br>   They should pay more attention to their manager, the wise Walter  Smith,   who talked last week of how the sectarian problem had been  tolerated  for  too long, and his relief that he was retiring. <br>&ldquo;To  be quite honest  with  you, I&rsquo;m quite glad to be getting out of it,&rdquo;  Smith said, which  was a  terribly sad admission from a man steeped in  Rangers since he was  a lad.<br><br> So that is one manager driven away  and another who might  have been  killed. And a stupid club who think  there is nothing odd,  amid all this  trouble, in handing out 40,000  Union Jacks. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Rangers to weigh up  appeal over Uefa ruling</h3><div>                                                               <div>  </div>                   </div>                                                                                                                              <div class="viewarticlepanel">                                                      <div class="multiimageon">                                                              <div>Martin Bain: question marks surrounding FARE&#39;s evidence.

The people who engage in this  type of behaviour are damaging the club  they claim to support.<br><br>&quot;It  is abundantly clear from this decision  that, if there is any sectarian  singing at future matches, the  suspended bans will take effect. Those  fans who engage  in such activity  need to take that message on board.  The majority of our fans understand  the situation and would much rather  focus on football. They showed that  clearly at Ibrox and the  tremendous atmosphere they created at last  weekend&#39;s Old Firm match was  a case in point.<br><br>&quot;In terms of the  Uefa case brought against us,  we have had serious concerns about the  integrity of the evidence  compiled by the FARE organisation and that  remains the case.<br><br>&quot;We  are also of the opinion that FARE has been  influenced by people who  make it their business to damage our club in  any way they can. We are  committed to the eradication of sectarianism  and believe it would have  been more constructive for FARE to work with  our club rather than  against it. Instead, they submitted evidence to  Uefa with a clear  objective in mind and have shown a complete lack of  transparency or  accountability when asked for clarification on various  aspects of that  evidence.&quot;<br><br>Rangers&#39; first match in European  competition next  season will be in either the qualifying rounds of the  Champions League  or Europa League, dependent on whether they finish the  current campaign  as SPL champions or runners-up.<br><br>It will also be  Ally McCoist&#39;s  first as manager after he replaces Walter Smith in the  job this summer.  The current assistant manager expressed his dismay as  the sectarian  problem which continues to haunt Rangers.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t  want our  supporters banned from watching their team,&quot; said McCoist. &quot;You  have to  ask whether that will work anyway. I&#39;m not sure it will hurt  the  people we are talking about. We need to get the whole thing sorted  out.<br><br>&quot;I  think things are a lot better than they used to be.  Society has  changed in the respect that that kind of behaviour is far  more  unacceptable. You get idiots in every walk of life. Some attach   themselves to the game, but it&#39;s a small minority who do that.<br><br>&quot;The vast majority of Rangers and Celtic fans are good, good people. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve   got good pals from my home town of East Kilbride who are Celtic fans   and the rivalry between us has never had anything to do with bigotry or   religion. The fact is that any of our fans who indulge in sectarian   chanting at our games are only hurting the club they are supposed to   love. <br><br>&quot;There is an onus on all of us to try and stamp it out,   but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much more Rangers as a club can do to try and   get that message across. We have done everything we possibly can but   some people don&#39;t want to listen. <br><br>&quot;If someone came to us and told us &#39;do this, it will solve the problem&#39;, then we would do it immediately.&quot;</div><br>                                                                        <ul class="viewarticle_info"><li>                           Last Updated:                             28 April 2011 11:28 PM                         </li><li>                                                         Source:                               The Scotsman                                                     </li></ul>                       <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h2>Craig Whyte profile: The Scots billionaire on the brink of taking over the club he loves   	</h2><div> 	 	<a class="external" href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/football/spl/rangers/2010/11/18/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Find all articles published on Nov 18 2010 to the Rangers section">Nov 18 2010</a> 	Keith Jackson, Daily Record <br><br>  	 	Craig Whyte started playing the stock market at the age of 15. By   the time he left school he had more than &pound;20,000 in his bank account.<br><br>  	Today, aged just 39, this financial whizzkid from Motherwell stands   on the brink of pulling off the biggest deal of his life - and finally   bringing the curtain down on one of the longest-running sagas in   Scottish football.<br><br> 	Record Sport understands self-made  billionaire Whyte has entered  into the final stages of negotiations to  buy control of the club he  loves from Sir David Murray.<br> 	And he&#39;s still one year younger than captain Davie Weir.<br><br>  	A deal worth around &pound;30million is now believed to have reached such   an advanced stage that sources say Whyte, a high-roller who splits his   time between a home in London and the idyllic Castle Grant in   Grantown-on-Spey, could even have the keys to Ibrox in time to fund a   major refurbishment of Walter Smith&#39;s top-team squad in January.<br><br>  	The news will delight Rangers supporters who have been fretting over   the future of their club ever since Murray first slapped a For Sale   sign on the front door of Edmiston Drive around three years ago.<br><br>  	As the club&#39;s financial health deteriorated to such an extent the   banks moved in to control the purse strings, a series of false dawns   came and went.<br><br><br> 	First, a consortium headed up by South  African-based tycoon Dave  King came to the fore only to fail to meet  Murray&#39;s asking price.<br><br> 	Then, in March this year, Londonbased  property developer Andrew  Ellis emerged as the frontrunner and was  granted a period of exclusivity  in order to get the deal done.<br><br>  	But Ellis, now part of the consortium, did not have the financial   clout to back up his bold promises and his bid collapsed, leaving   Rangers firmly in the grip of the Lloyds Group.<br><br> 	Exiled  Glaswegian King was then talked up once more as the possible  saviour  but he was also engaged in a long-running battle with the tax  man and  while those issues remained unresolved, he too looked l ike an   increasingly unlikely white knight for a club now engulfed by crisis.<br><br>  	But yesterday, quite out of the blue, Record Sport learned a new man   is at the table and that a deal to end Murray&#39;s 22-year reign is ready   to be completed.<br> 	And that man is a relative boy.<br><br> 	By the  age of 26, Whyte was already Scot land&#39;s youngest self-made   millionaire. Now, 13 years on, and in charge of a vast business empire,   his wealth is off the radar.<br><br> 	Whyte is a venture capitalist who  has made his millions from playing  the markets - a skill he secretly  began honing in his third year at  Glasgow&#39;s Kelvinside Academy. In one  of his few interviews he revealed  how he immediately regretted going to  the private school - because he  despised playing rugby.<br><br> 	He  said: &quot;I hated the discipline of it. It was a rugby-only school,  which I  didn&#39;t play as I was interested in football.&#39;&#39; Whyte worked  weekends  for his dad&#39;s plant hire firm. And he saved up his wages to  fund his  habit of gambling on Stock Exchange.<br><br> 	It is said that, by the time he left school, he had more cash in his bank than many of his teachers.<br> 	At 19, he was in charge of his own hire plant.<br><br>  	Now he owns his own castle - one of the most historic buildings in   Scotland. And very soon he could be adding Rangers to his portfolio. It   remains to be seen if Whyte&#39;s move to capture the club will f lush any   other parties out of the woodwork because - despite their failure to   strike a deal with Murray - King and his consortium have yet to throw in   the towel on their own ambitions.<br><br> 	They had put together a  package worth around &pound;18m but this was  flatly rejected and Ellis drove  the price up when he agreed to pay  Murray more than &pound;30m.<br><br> 	The club&#39;s debt has been reduced by around &pound;10m since then but the selling price remains the same.<br><br>  	Now, quite clearly, Whyte believes he will be able to close the deal   and the young gun must have said enough to impress Murray, who has   stated all along that he will only sell the club to the right people -   men with enough money to take the club forward.<br><br> 	Who knows? Murray may even regard Whyte as something of a kindred spirit.<br><br> 	After all, Murray was himself aged just 37 back in 1988 when he launched a takeover of the Ibrox club.<br><br>  	It was the beginning of one of the most successful periods in   Rangers&#39; history but Murray&#39;s aggressive pursuit of European glory   eventually saw him writing the kind of cheques that his club could   simply not afford.<br><br> 	Now Whyte is bringing his money to the table  but it remains to be  seen if he will adopt the same scatter-cash  approach as the man who has  owned the club for the past two decades.<br> 	But if he brings in even half of the number of trophies Murray delivered then the fans are unlikely to be complaining. 	</div>                                                                                     <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>     <img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Goram & the UVF - Pic" height="695" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/g2RgS8zseRwKpym7wZYTOQ56384/GW450H695" title="Rangers - Goram & the UVF - Pic" width="450"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Goram 7 Feb 99 page 1" height="995" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/xNdtIY-vRnoEGce1HktzCw1597017/GW778H995" title="Goram 7 Feb 99 page 1" width="778"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Goram 7 Feb 99 page 2" height="1432" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/hyncD_6FXKFi3XPaatqF5w811033/GW724H1432" title="Goram 7 Feb 99 page 2" width="724"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Goram 7 Feb 99 page 3" height="1440" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/pA5ce4r8tDg-nMFMI6SyGA877228/GW686H1440" title="Goram 7 Feb 99 page 3" width="686"><br><br><h3>13 May 2012</h3><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Pic" height="803" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/cPo-xOSp9ctr4QNRNZwsmg81839/GW600H803" title="Rangers - Pic" width="600"><br>                                                                                     <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table>     </div></div><h3>Davie Provan nails it. &quot;Post-liquidation Rangers&quot;, Dignity &amp; bigotry. </h3><br><img align="bottom" alt="Rangers - Miscellaneous articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="943" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/bcf81c831834c6472fe810c4b9771d02/GW599H943" title="Rangers - Miscellaneous articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="599"><br><br><h3>Former Ibrox vice chairman Donald Findlay says Rangers are a &#39;new entity&#39; which must establish &#39;its own history and tradition&#39; </h3><br>http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2816759/Donald-Findlay-says-Rangers-new-entity-establish-s-history-tradition.html<br> Donald Findlay feels sorry for Rangers fans who have stuck by the club<br> The former vice chairman does not know if Rangers will be promoted<br> Findlay is saddened to see a great club struggle <br><br>By Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline<br><br>Published: 10:25, 1 November 2014 | Updated: 10:54, 1 November 2014<br><br>706 shares<br><br>To the chairman of Cowdenbeath nights with the directors of Rangers are not the occasions they once were.<br><br>Donald  Findlay QC should be comfortable in the midst of David Somers and co.  He was once one of them. Vice-chairman of the company indeed.<br><br>But  these days he neither recognises the faces or names of the Rangers  board. Or, indeed, the &#39;new entity&#39; &ndash; his words &ndash; that they represent.<br>Former Rangers vice chairman Donald Findlay believes the Ibrox outfit are almost like a new side <br><br>Former Rangers vice chairman Donald Findlay believes the Ibrox outfit are almost like a new side <br><br>&#39;Welcoming  them to Central Park will be no different to welcoming anyone else for  me,&#39; Findlay tells Sportsmail, a vague waft of pipe tobacco detectable  in windowless side room in Glasgow&#39;s High Court. &#39;Why should it be?<br><br>&#39;I don&#39;t have many old friends there now. None on the organisational side.<br><br>&#39;I know Alistair McCoist and Durranty. But I don&#39;t actually know who is involved there any more.<br><br>&#39;Rangers  coming is a big occasion for the club and the town of course. The last  time they played Cowdenbeath in a league game was April 1971. The game  was originally scheduled to have been played on January 9 &ndash; but was  postponed because it was the Saturday after the Ibrox disaster.&#39;<br><br>This  appreciation of the history of Rangers is a feature of the  conversation. Findlay, trademark whiskers now greying slightly, is  wistful on the past and shows no compunction over turning his legal mind  to one of the most heated and prolonged debates in Scottish football.<br><br>His  learned friend Lord Nimmo Smith may have declared otherwise. But to  Donald Findlay the Rangers which visits Cowdenbeath on Tuesday is not  the same Rangers he once served.<br><br>&#39;It is a different club,&#39; he  tells Sportsmail bluntly. &#39;They may play at Ibrox and they may play  sometimes in royal blue jerseys.<br><br>&#39;But you cannot pass on that which is undefinable. And that is spirit and tradition and all the rest of it.<br><br>&#39;To me this is a new Rangers which has to establish its own history and tradition.<br><br>But it&#39;s not the Rangers I know. To me, genuinely, it is a new entity.&#39;<br><br>In  Rangers circles this kind of thing is heresy. When liquidation became  inevitable Charles Green, the former Chief Executive, insisted vocally  he had paid &pound;5.5million for the assets and history of the oldco in May  2012. Recently, Livingston&#39;s programmed editor lost his job after wading  into a contentious topic in a match programme.<br><br>Asked why he  flies in the face of the consensus among Rangers supporters - that they  remain the same club they always were - Findlay insists his view is a  personal one. In his mind &ndash; he is now 63 &ndash; things have changed.<br><br>&#39;Well, the view I have is one expressed to me by a lot of other Rangers supporters.<br><br>&#39;There is just not the same sense of things being done the Rangers way.<br><br>&#39;A  lot of Rangers supporters &ndash; and these are the guys I feel sorry for &ndash;  paid their money and remained loyal and followed the team through thick  and thin. And they tell me there is just something missing now.<br><br>&#39;That&#39;s  not only my view. It&#39;s what I am told by people from the inside in the  sense that they go to Ibrox. Something has changed, something is  missing. It&#39;s just somehow&hellip; different.&#39;<br><br>This sense of creeping  disenfranchisement with the running of Rangers is not unusual. Among fan  groups talk of boycott is now rife.<br><br>Suggesting that a club  playing at Ibrox in blue jerseys before Rangers supporters might be a  &#39;new&#39; Rangers, however, triggers a fresh stream of consciousness in one  of Scotland&#39;s great adversaries.<br>The former believes Rangers should not move away from Ibrox as the ground is steeped in history<br><br>The former believes Rangers should not move away from Ibrox as the ground is steeped in history<br><br>&#39;You  can buy assets,&#39; he concedes, &#39;but you can&#39;t buy history. You can&#39;t buy  tradition. History and tradition are in the heart and in the mind. You  can&#39;t buy that.<br><br>&#39;I don&#39;t care what anyone says.You cannot buy  Ibrox, you cannot buy the Blue Room, you cannot buy the trophy room  without actually understanding what it means.<br><br>&#39;I mean what every  little piece of it means right down to the crests on the radiators in  the Blue Room that were made in the same shipyards which made the Queen  Elizabeth liners.&#39;<br><br>There is the sense that Findlay, a formidable  adversary and hired gun paid to represent some of the most notorious  criminals in the country, has given this some thought.<br><br>&#39;You could  argue that if they (Rangers) had moved from Ibrox to a brand new  stadium at the time the whole thing collapsed, called it Rangers and  played in blue that you would automatically be taking all that history  and tradition with you.<br><br>&#39;Well, maybe some people can. That&#39;s fine. Good luck to them.<br><br>&#39;But for me personally tradition and history is in here.&#39;<br><br>He jabs a finger on his left hand towards his heart, an imprint on his black waistcoat clearly evident.<br><br>&#39;It&#39;s not in material things. It&#39;s understanding what the material things mean.<br><br>&#39;It&#39;s understanding what a genuine privilege it was to walk up the marble staircase.<br><br>&#39;Not every Tom, Dick and Harry should trail up the marble staircase at Ibrox you know.&#39;<br><br>In  recent years, of course, a long process of Tom, Dicks, Craigs and  Charlies have done just that. Findlay won&#39;t be drawn on what he thinks  of this.<br><br>&#39;So I&#39;m told,&#39; is all he offers.<br><br>He walked up the  stairs for the last time 15 years ago. The events which led to a  humiliating public resignation have been well documented. Captured on  camera at a club function singing &#39;The Sash&#39; he was subsequently  reported to considered suicide. He has no wish to rake over old coals.<br><br>&#39;It&#39;s so far in the past I&#39;m not going back there. Things happen to you, you deal with them and move on.&#39;<br><br>He  has revelled in running his hometown club of Cowdenbeath for the last  five, fraught years on a simple rule of thumb. Frustrated by the lack of  media attention &ndash; &#39;your paper and others treat us like s***&#39; - the Fife  club spend only what they earn.<br><br>Asked if the history of Rangers  might have been different if he had hung around longer to espouse this  manta he is mildly dismissive.<br><br>&#39;Ach, I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t say if  I could have changed things if I had stayed longer.Many people have  come and gone since then making decisions of which I know very little  about.&#39;<br><br>Rangers, he claims, were living within their means when  he left. The more extravagant spending of the Advocaat years had yet to  begin.<br><br>&#39;The budget at that time was managed and in control and  covered. If you are taking a financial risk it has to be against a  background of knowing you can cover that risk.&#39;<br><br>He won&#39;t deny  that the spending at Ibrox was far higher than anywhere else. Rangers  unashamedly &#39;lorded it&#39; over their rivals, including Celtic, and  savoured every minute.<br><br>One reason, he believes, why there was a  marked lack of sympathy among rival clubs when they hurtled towards the  fiscal cliff two and a half years ago.<br><br>&#39;Looking back on it you do think that sometimes what goes around comes around.<br><br>&#39;I  mean, come on &hellip;. to win nine championships in a row? You are entitled  to lord it a bit over the opposition then - and I think we did.<br><br>&#39;You  knew perfectly well that when you were beaten and your opponents said  &#39;thank you very much&#39; that the minute you left the room they would be  aiming a one arm salute at your back. That was fine.<br><br>&#39;There was a  terrific relationship with the old Celtic board you know. There was  nothing personal about it. Chris White and others were personal friends.<br><br>&#39;But, yes, it probably did heighten the sense of schadenfreude two years ago. But it was definitely good for business.&#39;<br><br>Ally McCoist&#39;s Rangers, in action against Hearts, are currently playing in the Scottish Championship<br><br>Rangers will have to beat off competition from Hearts and Hibs if they are going to earn promotion<br><br>The  presence of Rangers in the Championship is equally good for business  for Cowdenbeath now. Findlay is under no illusions their presence is a  short term situation. How short term is the million dollar question.<br><br>&#39;Is it inevitable Rangers will go up this season? Absolutely not.<br><br>&#39;I said that before the season started. There is absolutely no guarantee Rangers will go up, far from it.<br><br>&#39;They would be one of the favourites from the play-offs because of the resources they potentially have.<br><br>&#39;But  Rangers, Hearts and Hibs? One of them will be in the Championship next  year- guaranteed. Queen of the South and Falkirk are also ambitious  clubs.<br><br>&#39;So it&#39;s by no means guaranteed Rangers will go up.<br><br>&#39;I  could be selfish and say that suits me fine. I want them for another  season in the championship but for the good of the wider game in  Scotland it&#39;s time Rangers were back in the Premiership.&#39;<br><br>He is unrepentant on this. Rangers and Celtic, he believes, are simply too big to fail in a Scottish context.<br><br>&#39;They are not just football clubs &ndash; they are national institutions.<br><br>&#39;They have a presence in sport and also make a contribution to the economy which is huge.<br><br>&#39;Of course it&#39;s sad to see a great club the way it is. To see Rangers reduced is heart-breaking.<br><br>&#39;People  lost a lot of money and something had to be done about that. It was  wrong the way small businesses and shareholders lost money.<br><br>&#39;But  has it benefitted the game Rangers being in the lower divisions? Is the  game better because of it? I&#39;m not sure it is you know&hellip;&#39;<br></div></div>
