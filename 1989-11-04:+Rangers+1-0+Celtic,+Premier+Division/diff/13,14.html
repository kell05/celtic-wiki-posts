The second league meeting of the season of Rangers andCelticwas settled with just over a minute of normal time left by a goal of considerable accomplishment, scored by the former Celtic forward, Maurice Johnston. It came at a time when it seemed as thoughCelticwould leave Ibrox with a draw earned not so much by their control of play as by their ability to revive their cause after a first half in which Rangers&#39; superiority was scarcely challenged. Certainly the outcome might well have been beyond doubt by the interval had the home team taken half their chances in the first half.</div>  <div class="sevPx">  <br>Two lost opportunities, in particular, might have offered Rangers subsequent cause for regret, first, when McCoist struck Whyte, albeit accidentally, on the hand, and, second, when Stevens hit a forceful drive only for Bonner to save athletically.As is common in Glasgow derbies, the pattern reversed itself andCelticrecovered their nerve after the interval to the extent that when an error by Butcher permitted Miller a shot which Woods could not subdue, Coyne siezed on the rebound only to strike the post when the vacant goal beckoned.</div>  <div class="sevPx">  </div>  <div class="sevPx">  Thereafter, it looked as though the contest might drift towards a draw but when Stevens set off up the right flank in the 88th minute he struck a powerful cross which Morris cleared inadequately. The ball squirmed towards Johnston who steadied himself to drill a low drive beyond Bonner.</div>  <div class="sevPx">  <br>The forward then celebrated extravagantly behind the goal where the Rangers support had risen in unison to acclaim him, a gesture for which he was shown the yellow card.</div>  <div class="sevPx">  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td>  <div class="sevPx">  <br><b>The Guardian (London)</b><b>November6, 1989<br>Pain in the heart</b><br><br>BYLINE:By PATRICK GLENN<br><br>LIKE a discarded lover,Celtic felt the awful pain of bumping into their former dreamboat. Mo Johnston broke their hearts with the winning goal 90 seconds from the end and it really was a cruel way to treat an old flame. Johnston&#39;s metamorphosis from Celtic fanatic - indeed, one of the pioneers of the provocative self-blessing gesture in recent years - into confirmed blue-nose was completed seconds later when he made such a fuss of celebrating with theRangersfans that he was cautioned by the referee.<br><br>What does not change is his ability. As striker and all-round leader of the front line he is of the highest order. The Celtic fan who was marched out of the Broomloan Stand by police after hitting Johnston on the head with a meat pie during the first half acknowledged his talent for scaring the wits out of opponents. Yet Celtic, playing cautiously with three central defenders, seemed to have contained him and McCoist.Up to the interval Celtic found it almost impossible to break out of their own half but, for all their domination, Rangers had created two scoring chances.Celtichad a better chance themselves but Coyne, seven yards out from an unguarded goal, drove the ball against an upright. Alex Ferguson would have called it &#39;irresponsible&#39; finishing.</div>  <div class="sevPx">  </div>  <div class="sevPx">  Johnston demonstrated the proper method, steadying himself on the 18-yard line before shooting low to Bonner&#39;s right. The victory took Rangers to the top of the Premier Division on goal difference from Aberdeen, who led Dundee until Dodds equalised in the fourth minute of stoppage time.<br><br>SCORER: Rangers: Johnston (88min).</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Six big Old Firm games: Mo Johnston&#39;s derby winner...for Rangers </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/boos-jeers-and-a-pie-in-the-face-but-the-last-laugh-belonged-to-johnston.117130501</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Graeme Macpherson</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sports Writer</span><br><span class="diffAdd">.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Wednesday 28 January 2015 </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">IN the summer of 1989, Maurice Johnston achieved the near-impossible: he united the Old Firm.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">By completing what remains one of the most astonishing transfers in Scottish football history - when he signed for Rangers six weeks after appearing to have rejoined Celtic - Johnston managed to rouse equally the ire of both sets of supporters, disgusted with what had transpired for two very different reasons.</span><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The Celtic fans fumed at what they felt was an act of treachery. Johnston was &quot;their&quot; player, a lifelong Celtic fan who had played diligently and effectively for the club for three seasons, and who had nailed his colours to the mast when, after being sent off in the 1986 League Cup final defeat to Rangers, he had blessed himself as he trooped off the field.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">After two years with Nantes in France, Johnston was coming home to Celtic. Or so they thought. The transfer, though, would fall through due to tax issues and other complications, presenting Graeme Souness and Rangers with the chance to nip in and make him their player instead. They did not hesitate.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The Rangers supporters - not all but certainly a vocal minority - were not happy either. They were not keen on the idea of a well-known Celtic supporter and former player turning out for their club, nor with the fact that he was the club&#39;s first high-profile Roman Catholic signing, although not a particularly devout practitioner of the faith.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">A joke did the rounds that the wife of a fervent Bluenose had given birth to quadruplets and called them Eeny, Meeny, Miney and Billy. Rarely mentioned is the fact that Johnston was actually from a mixed family, his father a lifelong Rangers fan.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Many other Rangers supporters welcomed the transfer. Some recognised they had signed a very good player and in the process weakened their rivals. Others simply bathed in a sense of schadenfreude, enjoying the way the Celtic fans were working themselves into such a lather as, in their eyes, the Prodigal Son became Judas Iscariot.</span><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The more hardcore element of the Rangers support, however, would need to be convinced. Johnston would have to win them over on the field.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I was sitting at Firhill one day and there was a fella close to us who kept saying, &quot;he&#39;s not trying, we&#39;re playing with 10 men,&quot; and all that stuff, referring to Mo,&quot; recalled Andy Cameron, the Glasgow comedian and lifelong Rangers fan.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Then Mo scored a goal and the big guy jumped up to celebrate. I told him I thought Mo didn&#39;t count and he tried to tell me it was Nigel Spackman who had scored. It took him a while to convince a few folk.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The season did not start well for either player or team. Rangers lost their first two games against St Mirren and Hibernian without scoring a goal. Then came Johnston&#39;s return to Celtic Park, the first Old Firm clash taking place on the third game of the season. Johnston, predictably jeered throughout, did not play particularly well, missing two good chances as the match finished in a 1-1 draw. Convincing the doubters and the dissenters was proving harder than he thought.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Mo was hated by some of the supporters on both sides,&quot; added Cameron. &quot;And when he didn&#39;t score at Celtic Park in the first game there were a few grumbles that he wasn&#39;t trying. It was a load of rubbish. He was a really good pro and Rangers ended up getting two good years out of him.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The goals, however, would soon start flowing. Johnston scored the winner at home to Aberdeen, and then repeated the trick against Hearts a few weeks later. With fellow striker Ally McCoist also in good form - after Terry Butcher&#39;s equaliser at Parkhead the pair shared the next 14 Rangers goals - Johnston was quickly adapting to life in a Rangers jersey and playing well.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Then, on November 4, 1989, came the second Old Firm game of the season, this time at Ibrox. On a damn, sodden Glasgow afternoon, Johnston would this time make a telling contribution against his former club.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The size of the Celtic support was reduced - their 7500-allocation was housed entirely in the Broomloan stand rather than in part of the main stand or enclosure as had been the case previously - but they made enough noise to make it uncomfortable for Johnston. Sometimes the abuse went beyond the mere vocal.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">At one point as Johnston, perhaps unwisely, went to fetch the ball from near the Celtic support he was struck in the face with a half-eaten pie, the assailant huckled by the police and ushered out of Ibrox.

With the clock ticking down and a second Old Firm draw of the season looking likely, Rangers launched one more attack.

That showed how tough he was. That goal was an incredible moment for Mo, a real turning point. If anybody was going to score that day it was going to be him.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Some players, for whatever reason, mark a goal against a former club with a muted celebration. That idea clearly never crossed Johnston&#39;s mind. Similarly, if there had been any Rangers supporters determined not to acknowledge anything achieved by this one-time Celtic forward than there was little evidence of it. Scan the footage of Johnston haring towards the Copland stand and all he encounters is a sea of utter delirium. Evidence of anyone sitting, arms-crossed in a staunch, Presbyterian show of defiance, is notable only by its absence. Johnston had finally w
