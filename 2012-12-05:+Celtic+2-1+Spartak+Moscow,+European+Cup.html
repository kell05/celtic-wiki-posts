He later admitted at the time he didn&#39;t realise the importance of the goal as thought Barcelona were winning! It could have been all so different. Crazy!!!!<br>  </li><li>  Lionel Messi said he&#39;d ensure that Barcelona would win for the &#39;amazing Celtic&#39; fans. &quot;The Celtic fans deserve to be in Europe. I have never seen anything like that before.&quot; He came on as sub and taken off with an injury!<br></li><li>Celtic&#39;s 150th European Cup game.   </li><li>  Man City cost &pound;930m, Chelsea cost &pound;266m, Celtic &pound;12m; Man City (EPL Champions) bottom of their group, Chelsea (European Cup winners 2012) out at group stage, first time ever current holder has gone out at this stage, or Celtic squad cost: &pound;15 million. QUALIFIED. Chelsea squad cost: &pound;350 million. OUT. Manchester City squad cost: &pound;400 million. OUT. (you can take whatever figures but reads still we&#39;re the best!)   </li><li>  Interesting fact, if Barcelona didn&#39;t score the last minute winner vs Celtic. Celtic would have finished 1st in the table.   </li><li>  Celtic will make more money from this season&rsquo;s UCL than Charles Green will from his share issue. <br></li><li>Spartak sacked their manager two weeks prior after some poor results. <br>  </li><li>  Reports that Celtic&#39;s win earned each SPL club &pound;235,000, however later proven not to be the case. Celtic&#39;s group stage participation alone did earn the SPL &pound;1.5m instead of &pound;500,000, with the split between the other eleven still to be confirmed. If ever there was a good reason to want a Scottish club to do well in Europe, then that&#39;s it! <br>  </li><li>  Celtic&#39;s victory tonight means that the Scottish coefficient for 2012/13 is already the highest since 2007/08. Could still improve.   </li><li>  Spartak star Nigerian star claimed before game that other players don&#39;t like him (or the likes). Showed some disharmony in their squad.   </li><li>  We&#39;d embarrassingly drawn one each last weekend with lowly Arbroath in the Scottish Cup at home! </li><li>Green Brigade back after their two game home boycott although they refuse to do a Tifo etc. Currently in a spat with the club officials. <br>  </li><li>  Hun sycophant journalist Jim Traynor quits journalism ending with a tantrum article. Laughable and good riddance. Incompetent idiot anyhow. <br>  </li><li>  As Celtic are 10 minutes away from making the last 16 of the Champions League, Sevco watch on, preparing for their game against Montrose.</li><li>Celtic win UEFA&#39;s team of the week after this victory! see: <a class="external" href="http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=1904058.html#celtic+colts+kolarovs+mare+gift+horse" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a><br></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Review</h3>(Hellas67 of KDS)<img align="right" alt="2012-12-05: Celtic 2-1 Spartak Moscow, European Cup - Pic" height="335" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/zVuRFQjg3bhVG7SOGA3wPQ44526/GW263H335" title="2012-12-05: Celtic 2-1 Spartak Moscow, European Cup - Pic" width="263">  <br>In the first half we were pretty dire, and I hated seeing Ambrose so friendly with their attacker (Emienke???) as we saw when theycame out before the game (and at the start of the second half)chatting like long lost friends it seemed like that throughout the game he tried to make sure that he never offended said friend by actually challenging him for the ball, I was actually convinced at one point that he had been bought!!!<br><br>Anyway Lustig was immense before his injury, Sammi came onto a great game in the second half, but Mulgrew frustrated me with his corners almost always going into the keepers hands.<br><br>In the first half it seemed as if perhaps the nerves that visited us in the Benefica game would get the better of us again, but we showed far more purpose in the second half and I reckon we more than deserved to win it. I also reckon that Spartak were very lucky to have only one sent off as especially in the first half the went in from behind on almost every foul they gave away, and indeed in the second half even wee McGeady could consider himselft lucky not to have been shown a second yellow.<br><br>We have done it for the third time and have managed to gain ten points, both records for those who like such things (ie zombie wangers), but am I correct in thinking that perhaps it is a record points total also for a team orginally seeded fourth in the group to have obtained???<br><br>Who&#39;s going to pull up Jesus by the way, no not the saviour, by the benfica manager who said we didn&#39;t deserve to be their due to our negative attitude to playing the game?? If we were that negative how come we qualified two points clear of his team who couldn&#39;t even beat a second string barcelona, and indeed how come we managed to score four more goals than them......I hope they get totally pumped at the first stage of the europa league.......<br><br>By the way what is the combined value of the two best teams in the bestest bestest league in the world (copyright any English media outlet) who failed miserably to qualify............... <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3>  <div>  <div class="home-team">  <h3 class="team-name">  Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list">  <li>  01 Forster   </li><li>  03 Izaguirre   </li><li>  04 Ambrose   </li><li>  06 Wilson   </li><li>  21 Mulgrew   </li><li>  23 Lustig Booked (Matthews - 71&#39;

Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images<br><br>Celtic&#39;s progress has now been endorsed by material reward. On a freezing, nervous night in Glasgow, during which the football was rarely pretty, Neil Lennon earned the finest triumph of his managerial career to date. It was entirely in keeping with Lennon&#39;s character that his players battled as if their lives depended on victory.<br><br>Celtic were unfancied at the start of Group G but this win catapulted them into the Champions League&#39;s knockout stage. Few could quibble over them deserving that place, with Lennon&#39;s success all the more notable given the clubs who have already sampled elimination.<br><br>Kris Commons was the Celtic hero, with a penalty which saw off Spartak Moscow. That Spartak were probably worthy of a draw and enjoyed more possession than their hosts for long spells are irrelevant points in the grand scheme. Celtic&#39;s qualification is worthy of immense credit.<br><br>&quot;The players have performed a miracle,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;Nobody gave us a prayer in this group but we have qualified and deservedly so. This means the world to me.&quot;<br><br>The win for Celtic ensured 10 points from a Champions League group for the first time in their history. It also, crucially, bettered Benfica&#39;s scoreless draw in Barcelona.<br><br>Before kick-off, Celtic&#39;s anxiety could more reasonably have stemmed from Catalonia than Glasgow. Barcelona&#39;s team was noticeably understrength. Lionel Messi started among Tito Vilanova&#39;s substitutes but Andr&eacute;s Iniesta, Xavi Hern&aacute;ndez, Cesc F&aacute;bregas, Javier Mascherano and Jordi Alba were absent altogether.<br><br>Lennon had to do without the influential Victor Wanyama, who was suspended, but was otherwise untroubled by issues of selection.<br><br>Of more concern to Celtic&#39;s manager would have been the edgy start by his team, which was in tune with the stadium atmosphere. Spartak, who had nothing other than professional pride to play for amid a fruitless group campaign, used that spell to display the kind of fluency which contradicted the theory they are a club in turmoil. Still, it took 16 minutes for a goal threat of any kind. It arrived from the Russians, as Kim Kallstrom played a fine one-two with Artem Dzyuba before curling a 20-yard effort narrowly wide.<br><br>Spartak&#39;s blunder in affording Celtic the opening goal was therefore a surprise. Georgios Samaras played merely a hopeful ball forward, which Juan Insaurralde should easily have cut out. Instead, the Argentine woefully miscued his clearance straight to the feet of Gary Hooper and the striker lashed a low shot beyond Sergei Pesyakov.<br><br>Such clinical finishing has been an admirable trait during Celtic&#39;s European run. Heading into this game, they had a higher percentage of Champions League goals from shots on target than both Real Madrid and Barcelona. Hooper simply endorsed that statistic.<br><br>Spartak&#39;s response was admirable given their circumstances. The impressive Emmanuel Emenike shrugged off the attentions of Beram Kayal before playing in Ari, who offered a deft chip over the onrushing Fraser Forster. Kelvin Wilson&#39;s despairing goalline header could only help the ball into the net.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s start to the second half was brighter than it had been in the first. Their captain, Scott Brown, miscued a decent opportunity from inside the Spartak penalty area before Samaras struck the outside of a post with a close-range volley.<br><br>That effort was immediately followed by a first, inaccurate ripple of news throughout Celtic Park suggesting Barcelona had taken the lead. The danger attached to that was that the Celtic players could take heed of misinformation and temper their now brisk play.<br><br>Spartak sought to regain some impetus by introducing Aiden McGeady, a player once of this manor. The midfielder, a purchase from Celtic two years ago, would surely have started but for a knee problem. McGeady&#39;s guile was also the very commodity Celtic were in desperate need of with half an hour to play.<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew came within an acrobatic Pesyakov save of sending Celtic back in front. Commons had been the creator with a corner. A set-piece looked like Celtic&#39;s best hope of a winner. And so it proved. Samaras tumbled under a challenge from Marek Suchy, in winning what was a soft penalty.<br><br>Celtic had no reason to care about that, with Commons displaying wonderful nerve to blast home the spot-kick, with some assistance from the crossbar. &quot;I turned my back on it, I couldn&#39;t watch,&quot; said Lennon afterwards.<br><br>Kallstrom displayed Spartak frustration with a crazy challenge on Commons, which resulted in a second yellow card for the Swedish midfielder. Commons departed the field on a stretcher but he returned to join his team-mates in epic celebration. How Celtic had earned it.<br><br><br><h3>  Manager hails players after reaching last 16</h3>Celticfc.net  <br>By: Mark Henderson on 05 Dec, 2012 23:25<br><br>AN elated Neil Lennon has hailed his players as miracle workers after they overcame Spartak Moscow 2-1 in Paradise to qualify for the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League.<br><br>As the pot four side in their group, few gave them a chance of progression to the latter stages but a series of magnificent performances, including a 2-1 win over Barcelona, saw the Hoops book their place in the latter stages along with the Catalan giants.<br><br>It was another dramatic evening in Paradise, with Gary Hooper&acute;s opportunistic strike cancelled out by Ari before the break. However, Kris Commons restored Celtic&acute;s advantage from the penalty spot in the final 10 minutes, a goal greeted by delirium in the stands.<br><br>And the Scottish champions saw out the nervy closing stages, sparking memorable scenes of celebration among the players, backroom staff and supporters.<br><br>&quot;It means the world to me,&quot; said the manager after the game. &quot;Obviously I&acute;m a young manager and this is my first year in the Champions League. So to qualify with 10 points, I&acute;m very proud of the players. They performed a miracle. No one gave us a prayer going into this group, and we have qualified and deservedly so.<br><br>&quot;In the first-half we didn&rsquo;t play anywhere near as good as we can. In the second half I thought we had very good control of the match and deserved to win. We looked a lot better going forward and created good chances, and defensively we were a lot more solid than we were in the first half.<br><br>&quot;We just looked a bit tentative with them in the first half and we said, &acute;Look lads, you have so hard to get here, go and take it,&acute; and they&acute;ve done it.<br><br>It&acute;s a privilege to manage this club,&quot; he added. &quot;It&acute;s not easy at times as there is great expectations on you. Getting into this campaign was vitally important for myself and just to see where I could take it.<br><br>&quot;We have recruited well. We have built a decent team who are young and hungry and not fazed by the financial side of it. They want to get better and they have done the club proud.<br><br>&quot;We will enjoy it but you can only enjoy it was a manager for a few hours and then we can start thinking of Kilmarnock on Saturday.&quot; <br><br>The strains of London Calling by The Clash were heard around Paradise at final whistle, in reference to the UEFA Champions League final being held at Wembley on May 25, 2013.<br><br>Now that they have achieved such a milestone in reaching the last 16, the Hoops boss just wants his charges to enjoy it and see what they can accomplish thereafter.<br><br>&quot;We are there and going to enjoy it,&quot; he said. &quot;We want to progress as far as we can in the competition, and who knows where it can take you. The spirit is fantastic.<br><br>&quot;We have some quality players. They have put everything into the group and they have grown as the campaign has gone on. Some of them have enhanced their reputations no end.<br><br>&quot;As a collective they have great belief in themselves, and who knows where it can take you. We will look forward to the draw. It&acute;s very exciting times for everyone concerned at the club. We have got something to really get our teeth into in the new year.&quot;<br><br>The draw for the last 16 will be conducted in two weeks, on Thursday, December 20, with the fixtures scheduled for February 2013. Now the manager wants his players to start building some momentum domestically.<br><br>&quot;The draw is on the 20th and is something to really look forward to and now I want them to concentrate on domestic duties and start finding that real consistency in the league,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;They have shown what they can do at European level. I feel a lot of them have put their focus into this campaign but now they can put that to the side for a few months and start tidying up domestic matters.&quot;<br><br><h3>  Super Celts reach last 16 of UEFA Champions League</h3>Celticfc.net  <br>By: Laura Brannan on 05 Dec, 2012 21:49<br><br>December 5, 2012<br>UEFA Champions League match day 6<br>Celtic Park<br><br>CELTIC 2<br>(Hooper 21, Commons 82 pen)<br><br>SPARTAK MOSCOW 1<br>(Ari 39)<br><br>CELTIC booked their place in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League for the third time in their history thanks to a well-deserved 2-1 win against Spartak Moscow inside a packed Paradise.<br><br>Kris Commons struck the winning goal from the penalty spot on 82 minutes after Gary Hooper had given Celtic a first-half lead. Ari sent the sides in even at the break with an equaliser on 39 minutes but the Hoops were too strong for their Russian visitors in the second half.<br><br>Spartak Moscow were reduced to 10 men near the end, but so too were Celtic when Commons had to be stretchered off as a result of Kim Kallstrom&acute;s late challenge. And after a tense end to the match, which saw the capacity crowd waiting nervously for the game to finish in the Nou Camp, Celtic progressed due to their 2-1 victory and the goalless draw between Barcelona and Benfica.<br><br>Neil Lennon has made several changes to the side that drew with Arbroath at the weekend, with Mikael Lustig, Efe Ambrose and Scott Brown remaining in the starting XI. Fraser Forster returned to his place between the sticks while Georgios Samaras partnered Hooper up front.<br><br>Spartak Moscow had the first real chance of the first half on 12 minutes when Ari sent a low ball into the box. Emmanuel Emenike tried to get on to the end of it but it was cleared before he could execute a shot.<br><br>At the opposite end, Celtic mounted an almost identical attack, with Charlie Mulgrew providing the cross in for Hooper. There was too much on the ball, though, and the striker couldn&rsquo;t get his head to it on time.<br><br>Kallstrom saw his powerful effort go just past the post a minute later but it wasn&rsquo;t long before the Hoops opened the scoring. Making a quick break, Samaras spotted the run of Hooper and threaded the ball through to him. A poor attempt at a clearance from Juan Insaurralde put the ball into the path of Hooper and he fired home a powerful, first-time shot into the net.<br><br>And the home side continued to cause problems for the Russian&acute;s defence. From a Spartak corner, they made another break and won their own corner at the opposite end. The initial attempt was blocked but Commons followed through with the rebound, unfortunately only hitting the side-netting.<br><br>And the Hoops rued that miss on 39 minutes when Spartak drew level. Ari was given too much space on the right side of the box, and he chipped the ball over Forster. Kelvin Wilson chased it in an attempt to clear it but he could only make contact as it crossed the line.<br><br>The sides went into the break 1-1, but Celtic looked hungry as Samaras cracked the ball off the post just six minutes into the second half with a first-time volley.<br><br>Spartak Moscow were throwing all their men back into their final third, though, and it made it difficult for Celtic to break them down. Ambrose came within inches of giving Celtic the lead when he hit the side netting on 71 minutes with a header, and shortly after Mulgrew was denied by an outstanding save by Sergei Pesyakov. The outstretched keeper got his fingertips to the defender&acute;s header from a corner.<br><br>But it wasn&rsquo;t long before Celtic Park erupted again, this time when the referee, Felix Brych, awarded the home side a penalty. Samaras went down under a Marek Suchy challenge and Commons stepped up to take the spot-kick, cracking it off the underside of the bar and into the net.<br><br>And Spartak&acute;s misery continued when they were reduced to 10 men just before stoppage time. Kallstrom was shown a second yellow for a challenge on Commons, but as he walked, the Celtic goalscorer had to also exit on a stretcher.<br><br>But when the full time whistle went in the Nou Camp, with the scoreline finishing 0-0, the celebrations quickly kicked off in Paradise. And seconds later the full time whistle sounded to confirm Celtic&acute;s place in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League. It is an impressive achievement from Neil Lennon and his players.<br><br>CELTIC (4-4-2): Forster; Lustig (Matthews 71), Ambrose, Wilson, Izaguirre; Commons, Brown (Ledley 85), Kayal (Lassad 73), Mulgrew; Samaras, Hooper<br>Subs not used: Zaluska, Rogne, Miku, Watt<br><br>SPARTAK MOSCOW (4-4-2): Pesyakov, Inssauralde, K.

So I wanted to go as high as possible without ballooning it over the bar.<br><br>&quot;Luckily enough for me, it hit the underside of the bar. I think it went in after the bounce and into the roof of the net. My heart stopped for a millisecond and then I was able to celebrate.<br><br>&quot;I thought Barcelona were winning anyway, so I just thought, &acute;smash this in, we have done our part and won but Benfica are losing anyway&acute;.<br><br>&quot;We got the feeling from the crowd that Barcelona had scored and then we heard them signing about Xavi, and I thought he must have scored and it was 1-0.<br><br>&quot;When the manager brought Lassad on, I thought maybe we do need a goal here.<br><br>&quot;Playing in that game, they were dangerous on the counter attack which they showed with the goal.<br><br>&quot;If the draw was enough for us, then I would have been quite happy just to sit in our positions and let them keep the ball. That&acute;s what they were doing in the second half, the goalkeeper and back-four were keeping it. And we didn&rsquo;t feel we had to go and press them, force the issue and try and get a goal.<br><br>&quot;We were in the frame of mind, they are keeping it, happy days, we just need a point and we are through.<br><br>&quot;I could sense this anxiousness about the fans being a big edgy and with the manager showing a willingness to get a goal and then with Lassad coming on, I then thought maybe we do need a goal.<br><br>&quot;But I thought someone from the sidelines would have said something, so taking the penalty I had no idea what the consequences were - I would have probably passed it to Lassad!<br><br>&quot;I scored the penalty against St Johnstone so if you score your last one, you have a great shout of getting the next one. Lassad said, &acute;do you want me to take it&acute;, I said, &acute;no, I will put my foot through the ball and smash it in&acute;.&quot;<br><br>Reaching the last-16 is a magnificent achievement for Neil Lennon and his players, and something few gave them a chance of doing at the outset of the group stages when Barcelona, Benfica and Spartak Moscow were drawn alongside them.<br><br>However, Commons insisted he and the rest of the dressing room always had a belief they could progress.<br><br>&quot;I can remember doing an interview before the first game against Benfica and I did say we wanted to progress into the last-16 and qualify from this group,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;There were a few smiles and sniggers. But in the dressing room we were quietly confident, especially with our home form, we could give anyone a game on our day. We knew we had a good, young squad who were hungry to succeed and I think we feel have proved a lot of people wrong<br><br>&quot;The turning point was the game in the Nou Camp. We proved we could defend so resiliently for 94 minutes and if we had done it for 94-and-a-half minutes, we would have got the point we deserved.<br><br>&quot;That turned a few peoples&acute; heads. Then winning 2-1 against Barcelona at home put us in a great position to qualify.<br><br>&quot;I don&acute;t think it&acute;s truly sank in yet &ndash; the achievement and proving all the doubters wrong,&quot; he added. &quot;But looking back on the TV last night and how we played and how the fans were, it was a massive boost for us and puts us in good stead for the new year now.&quot;<br><br>Just minutes after scoring the winning goal, Commons was forced from the fray on a stretcher following a reckless tackle from Kim Kallstrom.<br><br>The Swedish midfielder received a second yellow card and his marching orders, and with Celtic having made all their substitutes, both sides ended the game with 10 men apiece.<br><br>It made the celebrations at the final whistle slightly surreal for the Scottish internationalist as he sat receiving treatment in a separate room as his team-mates danced for joy.<br><br>&quot;I wasn&rsquo;t in there too long anyway,&quot; he said. &quot;I was lying there and they were wanting to know if I wanted an ambulance, x-rays and bits and bobs. By the time, I had five minutes worth of ice, they were back in and it sounded like a nightclub in the dressing room.<br><br>&quot;The injury isjust a dead leg. It was kind of surreal. From the Barcelona game when everyone was bouncing around in the changing room loving the fact we had beaten possibly the best team in the world, and then we finally qualify for the last-16 and I was in a room on my own, strapped up with a splint on my leg. It was a bit surreal but it&acute;s sinking in now.&quot;<br><br>Celtic now have two weeks to anticipate the draw for the latter stages with the likes of Juventus, Manchester United, Paris-St Germain, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund possible opponents.<br><br>And while he doesn&rsquo;t fear anyone, Commons&acute; preference would be a &acute;Battle of Britain&acute; encounter.<br><br>&quot;On our day we can beat anyone and we have proved that, not only in the SPL, the cup but on the European stage against top sides.&quot; he said. &quot;On our day, I don&acute;t think anyone will fancy coming to Celtic Park, with our fans and the way we approach games and how we set up to win.<br><br>&quot;It&acute;s going to be a tough draw whoever it is.
