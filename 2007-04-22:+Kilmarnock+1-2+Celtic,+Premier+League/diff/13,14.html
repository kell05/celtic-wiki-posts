winner<br>Nakamura&#39;s late strike secured Celtic&#39;s title victory<br>Celtic wrapped up the Premier League title with four games to play thanks to a stunning injury-time free-kick from Shunsuke Nakamura.<br><br>Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink headed Celtic in front from a Nakamura corner kick after 24 minutes.<br><br>Peter Leven and Steven Naismith missed glaring chances for Killie before good work from Gary Wales set up Colin Nish for a simple tap-in after the break.<br><br>But Nakamura curled in a wonderful strike from 22 yards to seal the win.<br><br>Celtic manager Gordon Strachan has now emulated his predecessor Martin O&#39;Neill by winning back-to-back titles in his first two years at the club.<br><br>Celtic defender John Kennedy returned for the first time in more than three years following the terrible knee injury sustained on his Scotland debut.<br><br>But he had little to do in the opening stages as the visitors began brightly, with both Paul Hartley and Derek Riordan going close with strikes from distance.<br><br>Killie hit back with a shot from Nish and a Wales header was knocked off the line by Riordan, although Artur Boruc looked perfectly placed to save.<br><br>Celtic went ahead when Vennegoor of Hesselink rose highest in a congested penalty box to glance in a corner from Nakamura.<br><br>Peter Leven squandered a great chance to level immediately when he sent a free header over the top from seven yards.<br><br>Celtic skipper Neil Lennon then threatened a rare goal but Killie keeper Alan Combe got fingertips to his fierce 25-yard shot.<br><br>High crosses continued to cause problems for both sides and Vennegoor of Hesselink flashed a header wide before Steven Pressley&#39;s powerful nod was kept out by Combe.<br><br>Right on half-time, home striker Steven Naismith was given a clear sight of goal a few yards out but tentatively poked at the ball, allowing Boruc to save.<br><br>Celtic were claiming for a penalty early in the second half when a Thomas Gravesen shot was deflected off-course by the hand of Grant Murray.<br><br>Having enjoyed that let-off, Kilmarnock raced up the park and equalised.<br><br>Wales did well to skip past Darren O&#39;Dea and get to the by-line and, with Boruc covering his near post, his inviting cut-back was tucked into an empty net by Nish.<br><br>Naismith then found room in the Celtic penalty area but Boruc got down well to block the striker&#39;s shot and Wales sent a curling effort narrowly wide from 18 yards.<br><br>Celtic replied with a drilled dig from Nakamura that Combe did well to hold and Riordan skewed a shot wide after a penalty box scramble.<br><br>With 89 minutes on the clock, the ball broke to Riordan on the angle of the six yard box but he blazed his shot high and wide and it looked like Celtic would have to wait at least another week for the party to begin.<br><br>However, Nakamura had the last say when he curled a sweet strike round the defensive wall and beyond the static Combe.<br><br>Kilmarnock: Combe, Sylla (Di Giacomo 86), Greer, Ford, Grant Murray, Wales, Locke (Hamill 83), Fowler, Leven, Nish, Naismith (Gibson 90).

We have players here, like Neil Lennon, who set the standard.&quot;<br><br>Strachan then went on to single out Shunsuke Nakamura, the match-winner at Kilmarnock. &quot;The man is a genius,&quot; said the delighted manager.<br><br>Interview: Celtic manager Gordon Strachan<br>Interview: Celtic captain Neil Lennon<br><br>The Japanese playmaker curled in a last-minute free-kick to seal a dramatic 2-1 win at Rugby Park.<br><br>Defender John Kennedy had much to celebrate after making his first appearance for Celtic since his long battle with a knee injury.<br><br>And Strachan added: &quot;You are not going to believe this, but my over-riding emotions are about a man who can come back and play like that after being out for three years.<br><br>&quot;I never spoke to him before the game, I just named the team but I just couldn&#39;t stop speaking to him afterwards.<br><br>&quot;I said to him, &#39;in all your dreams, I bet you never imagined this.&#39; &quot;Obviously celebrating with the fans at the end was fantastic but I just can&#39;t get John Kennedy out of my head.&quot;<br><br>Celtic chairman Brian Quinn also joined in the post-match fun as the title was wrapped up with four games left to play.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s arguably been the best season we have had in the last 30 to 40 years,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Not only have we won the championship with games to spare, we have got to the Scottish Cup final and the last 16 of the Champions League.<br><br>&quot;Not only did we get there in the Champions League, we played well and only bowed out after 120 minutes at AC Milan.<br><br>&quot;It has been a fantastic season.&quot;<br><br>Strachan replaced Martin O&#39;Neill two years ago and has repeated the revered Irishman&#39;s achievement of two back-to-back titles in his first two seasons.<br><br>Quinn added: &quot;Martin O&#39;Neill had to leave for reasons we all know about and the challenge for us on the board was to find a successor who was worthy to carry forward the Celtic name and the Celtic reputation.<br><br>&quot;We found that man - Gordon Strachan.&quot;<br><br>As for a summer transfer kitty for Strachan, Quinn added: &quot;We will do everything we can to meet Gordon&#39;s needs.<br><br>&quot;You have to get the season behind you before you can take a considered and balanced view of how the season has gone, where your strengths are and where your weaknesses are.&quot;<br><br><br><br><h3>Celtic&#39;s title relief</h3>By Clive Lindsay<br>BBC <br>For Celtic, the waiting is over and Gordon Strachan can, for the moment at least, forget the rumbles of discontent among a section of the club&#39;s support after clinching back-to-back championships.<br><br>A title race at the start of which Rangers and Hearts were tipped to run the reigning champions close, or even trip them up, has at last been put out its misery after what has long been an inevitable procession.<br><br>At one stage, such were the implosions suffered down Ibrox and Gorgie way, it looked like Celtic would retain the Scottish title in record time.<br><br>But they were getting twitchy in the East End of Glasgow in recent weeks as Celtic suffered a Champions League exit hangover.<br><br>Perhaps it was predictable considering the paucity of the challenge that Rangers, their closest challengers, failed to take advantage and slipped up themselves.<br><br>But you can only beat the opposition that is put before you and Celtic have done that with something to spare for much of the season.<br><br>Yet the very lack of serious challengers has been part of Strachan&#39;s problem this term.<br><br>Even after winning the title back from Rangers in his first season in charge, there were elements of the Celtic support that did not take to the former Aberdeen and Manchester United midfielder.<br><br>They pointed to the &pound;1.5m purchase of Adam Virgo, subsequently farmed out to Coventry, as an example of a lack of savvy in the transfer market.<br><br>The expensive hiring of former Real Madrid midfielder Thomas Gravesen has provided the snipers with further ammunition, while Derek Riordan has been his misfit pal in the dugout or stand.<br><br>Paul Hartley and Steven Pressley have hardly set the green and white heather on fire since being replanted at Parkhead from Hearts and Strachan has confounded many by his persistence with the anonymous Jiri Jarosik.<br><br>Brother in law Paul Telfer was often unfairly vilified by the Celtic support despite a series of steady performances at right-back.<br><br>But Lee Naylor has been such an astute purchase that surprise has been expressed that the former Wolves man has not made England&#39;s troublesome left-back position his own.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink has been an able replacement for John Hartson.<br><br>And, whatever your opinion of the individual cogs, Strachan has built a playing machine that has proven capable of shifting up the necessary gears whenever there appeared to be challenge from any of their SPL rivals.<br><br>Late goals, late fightbacks, turning round deficits have become the trademark of Strachan&#39;s Celtic.<br><br>The real domestic test may be around the summer corner should Rangers, Hearts or even Aberdeen, Dundee United or Hibernian provide a more capable challenge.<br><br>Celtic boss Gordon Strachan looks less than happy at a Uefa news conference<br>Gordon Strachan&#39;s Champions League success should please fans<br>Walter Smith has already steadied the ship at Ibrox after the failed French revolution under Paul Le Guen.<br><br>Hearts fans will be hoping their umpteenth new manager, whoever he might be, will be able to use Vladimir Romanov&#39;s boasted millions while shackling the owner&#39;s megalomania.<br><br>Aberdeen could continue their steady progress under Jimmy Calderwood. Similarly, Dundee United under Craig Levein.<br><br>Hibs, despite a dressing-room revolt, have managed to win one knockout trophy and are within touching distance of another.<br><br>But, if you consider Celtic in European terms, they all face much catching up to do, although Rangers quickly fell from grace following an identical achievement the previous season.<br><br>Strachan led Celtic to the Champions League last 16 for the first time, where they held AC Milan to a scoreless draw over two legs until extra-time.<br><br>That was further than was achieved by his predecessor, Martin O&#39;Neill, and nobody can take that - and two runaway and thoroughly deserved championships in a row - away from their present manager.<br><br><br><br><h3>Celtic - it takes guts for glory</h3>By Colin Moffat<br>BBC <br>Celtic have cantered to a second successive Scottish Premier League title, but the route to success was not all plain sailing.<br><br>On occasion, Gordon Strachan&#39;s side had to dig deep and pull on their enviable strength of character to salvage crucial points.<br><br>The champions have won an amazing 25 league games so far and 17 of those have been by a single goal.<br><br>BBC Sport looks back at the key games as Celtic refused to be knocked off their championship-winning course.<br><br>ABERDEEN 0-1 CELTIC, 9 September<br><br>With 11 minutes remaining, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink cracked in a 20-yard shot to seal a deserved win for the visitors.<br><br>FALKIRK 0-1 CELTIC, 1 October<br><br>Celtic were not at their best against a lively Falkirk side, but Aiden McGeady popped up to drive in a 86th-minute winner.<br><br>CELTIC 2-1 HEARTS, 4 November<br><br>The home side moved 13 points clear at the top of the table thanks to a dramatic late own goal from Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon.<br><br>Hearts had been the more menacing team and went in front on 72 minutes thanks to Andrius Velicka.<br><br>But, with four minutes left, Jiri Jarosik headed in from a corner and, as Celtic pressed in the dying seconds, Gordon fumbled into his own net after appearing to gather a shot from Stephen McManus.<br><br>HIBERNIAN 2-2 CELTIC, 26 November<br><br>Hibs&#39; aggression and pace saw them build a two-goal cushion through Ivan Sproule and Kevin Thomson, but the home side ran out of steam and Celtic ruthlessly hit back to snatch a share of the spoils.<br><br>On 70 minutes, Evander Sno coolly drilled a shot home after a positive run from Kenny Miller and, soon after, Aiden McGeady found the corner of the net with a precise 20-yard strike.<br><br>CELTIC 2-2 DUNDEE UTD, 26 December<br><br>Once again, Celtic stormed back late on to rescue a game that looked beyond them.<br><br>David Robertson headed United into a surprise lead and Collin Samuel fired in following a Barry Robson free-kick.<br><br>But Darren O&#39;Dea knocked home a Shunsuke Nakamura free-kick from six yards after 78 minutes and the Japanese playmaker later found the net with a sublime chip from 20 yards.<br><br>HEARTS 1-2 CELTIC, 14 January<br><br>Celtic went a massive 17 points clear after another eventful comeback - this time at Tynecastle.<br><br>Jiri Jarosik (centre) was the match-winner at Tynecastle<br>Jiri Jarosik (centre) was the match-winner at Tynecastle<br><br>Hearts started strongly and went ahead thanks to a rocket shot from Saulius Mikoliunas.<br><br>Celtic survived a few scares before Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink levelled from close range on the hour and Jiri Jarosik settled the match with a fine, low drive 20 minutes later.<br><br>INVERNESS CT 1-2 CELTIC, 28 January<br><br>Derek Riordan tapped into an empty goal to put Celtic in front, but Inverness threw everything at the visitors and Graham Bayne headed the equaliser after the break.<br><br>However, Celtic showed exactly what they are made of when Jan Venegoor of Hesselink lashed in an injury-time winner.<br><br>KILMARNOCK 1-2 CELTIC, 22 April<br><br>Just when it looked like Celtic&#39;s title party would be delayed for at least another week, Shunsuke Nakamura stepped up to curl in a wonderful injury-time free-kick.<br><br>Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink headed the visitors in front only for the battling hosts to level the game thanks to a Colin Nish goal.<br><br>With seconds remaining, the Japanese playmaker delivered an inch-perfect finish to wrap up the title in dramatic style.<br><br><br><h3>Ebullient Strachan says playmaker tops list of those he&#39;s worked with</h3>The Scotsman<br>GORDON Strachan savoured his second successive championship triumph last night with a salute to the man who clinched it in stoppage time at Rugby Park.<br><br>The Celtic manager hailed Shunsuke Nakamura, the Japanese playmaker whose stunning free-kick snatched the 2-1 win over Kilmarnock which finally took the reigning champions over the finishing line in this season&#39;s competition, as a &quot;genius&quot; and the most technically proficient footballer he has ever played alongside or coached.<br>Strachan and his leg-weary team had looked set to see their quest to retain the title stretch into at least another week until Nakamura guided the controversially awarded set piece around Kilmarnock&#39;s defensive wall and beyond goalkeeper Alan Combe into the corner of the net.<br>&quot;I thought it was going to be another long week for us,&quot; said Strachan, &quot;but I&#39;m lucky to have a genius on board. When we were awarded the free-kick, I thought &#39;naw, he can&#39;t do it again&#39;. It was asking too much of him, but he did it. He didn&#39;t have his best game for us today, but he never stopped showing for the ball and it was fitting that he should score the goal which won the title.<br>&quot;He has played more minutes for us than anyone else this season and covered more ground than any player. He has looked physically and mentally tired recently, but he still managed to produce when it mattered. He is the most technically gifted player I have ever been involved with in the game.<br>&quot;I played with guys like Bryan Robson and Kenny Dalglish, who were fabulous footballers, but for a sublime touch, Naka is the best. &quot;<br>Nakamura, who burst into tears after an uncharacteristically wild celebration of his goal which earned him a booking, was highly critical of his overall performance and felt he had to produce a moment of magic to compensate.<br>&quot;I made a few mistakes in the game,&quot; said Nakamura. &quot;I have never behaved like that after scoring before, but it meant a lot to me.<br>&quot;The free-kick against Manchester United this season was also important, but this one was probably the best.&quot;<br>Strachan, who had seen a lead at the top of the table which once stood at 22 points reduced to 10 by the time his team kicked off yesterday, believes his second SPL success as Celtic manager is a greater achievement that his first as a consequence of the personnel changes to his squad over the past year.<br>&quot;I enjoyed this one more, because it was so long it coming,&quot; he said. &quot;It was harder to win, because we lost some huge personalities after last season. We lost Shaun Maloney, who was Scotland&#39;s Player of the Year last year, we lost Stilian Petrov, Chris Sutton, John Hartson and Roy Keane. That is some amount of big players to lose.<br>&quot;It was hard to get over the line in the end, but a lot of credit goes to the younger players we have brought into the team this season. I&#39;m absolutely delighted to win it again. I&#39;m also absolutely whacked, but I&#39;m delighted because I have had the best players in the country this season.&quot;<br>Strachan clearly relished the celebratory scenes after the match at Rugby Park, plucking young Celtic supporters from the crowd to join in the festivities with his players on the pitch. There were also chants of &quot;One Gordon Strachan&quot; from fans who have often allowed their feelings towards Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s successor to be the subject of considerable doubt.<br>&quot;It is great to be appreciated,&quot; said Strachan. &quot;We had fun out there after the game. I think a few parents were a bit wary about handing their kids over to a strange man running around with a bad hip, but it was a good chance to get them involved and meet some of their idols.&quot;<br>Asked about recent speculation that he may be tempted to leave Celtic this summer for a return to English football, Strachan was somewhat ambiguous with his response but did insist that he continues to get considerable job satisfaction from his current role.<br>&quot;People who speculate about me don&#39;t really know me,&quot; he said. &quot;A lot of them haven&#39;t even met me and a lot of them never will. I just love being the manager of Celtic, I can&#39;t say any more than that. The technique in the SPL is not the best, we all have to accept that and it&#39;s something which needs to improve. But what we do have is good coaches and players who play the game in the right spirit.&quot;<br>Strachan&#39;s team were lauded as deserving title winners by Kilmarnock manager Jim Jefferies, although he bristled at the soft award of the decisive free-kick when Nakamura went down easily under a challenge from Gary Wales.<br>&quot;He [Nakamura] miscontrolled the ball a wee bit and then played for the free-kick,&quot; said Jefferies. &quot;I knew he would score and it&#39;s the fourth or fifth time he has done it to us. It was cruel, because we didn&#39;t deserve to lose the game, but Celtic are worthy champions this season.&quot;<br>(c) 2007<br>The Scotsman  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br></embed></div>
