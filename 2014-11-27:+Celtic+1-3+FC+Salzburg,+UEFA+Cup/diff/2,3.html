Even my friend Gonga must have looked at Ronny planked to his  seat and uttered the odd obscenity. Our defensive structure is  non-existent, which is even more problematic when Efe Ambrose is  playing; his &quot;pass&quot; in the first half  . Van Dijk had an off night and both our full backs were asked to do  too much I felt. One clean sheet in our last nine European games speaks  volumes.<br><br>McGregor was absolutely hopeless, Griffiths worked his  socks off to no great effect and only Brown played particularly well I&#39;d  say. Kampl was MOTM by a country mile. <br><br>The 2nd half display was  much better, with good pressure for the odd 5 minute spell here or  there, although it was obvious Salzburg went down a gear or two. However  our passing retention was still sloppy, we didn&#39;t create many clear cut  chances and ultimately they deserved to leave with 3 points. I&#39;m just  glad they didn&#39;t win 4-1 and inflict our biggest ever home European  defeat.<br><br>As for the manager, I&#39;m assuming Forrest wasn&#39;t 100% fit,  otherwise starting McGregor was a bizarre selection. I wasn&#39;t  particularly annoyed that Griffiths started ahead of Scepovic, but the  way Deila has handled the latter after scoring 2 goals in 2 starts  really baffles me. Scepovic hasn&#39;t even come off the bench recently.  Kudos Ronny, we&#39;ve ensured European football after christmas. But it  feels like we muddled our way through and sadly the similarities with  Mowbray continue with three home defeats in six against continental  opposition. Onwards and upwards, I suppose.<br><br>As an aside,  qualifying should now keep Van Dijk at the club until the summer (bar a  crazy offer) and will hopefully improve our chances of signing Guidetti;  as will a semi final against Sevco. Doing so should be our club&#39;s  number one priority in the next 2 months and hopefully we&#39;re making  inroads behind the scenes. <br><br>... okay another positive, considering the half-empty stadium and final result, the atmosphere was pretty good tonight. 						 						 						 					<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    26  Gordon         </li><li>    02  Matthews         </li><li>    04  Ambrose Emuobo         </li><li>    05  van Dijk         </li><li>    03  Izaguirre         </li><li>    08  Brown         </li><li>    21  Mulgrew      (Tonev - 74&#39;

Red Bull Salzburg - Borges de Carvalho (8, 13) Keita (90)<br><br>On a night when Red Bull Salzburg deservedly became the first Austrian team ever to win a European tie on Scottish soil, Celtic joined them nonetheless in reaching the last 32 of the Europa League, courtesy of Dinamo Zagreb&rsquo;s failure to beat Astra in the other Group D tie.<br><br>It means the Scottish champions&rsquo; trip to the Croatian capital in a fortnight is now a dead rubber but Deila&rsquo;s team will still be expected to show a far more convincing level of performance if they are to harbour any serious hopes of making an impact in the knockout phase.<br><br>Trailing 2-0 after just 13 minutes to a double from Brazilian striker Alan, Celtic were staring embarrassment in the face against group winners Salzburg. Stefan Johansen&rsquo;s riposte before half-time restored a sense of respectability but Naby Keita&rsquo;s stoppage-time goal brought the evening to a chastening end.<br><br>Many among the home support would still have been trying to digest Deila&rsquo;s eyebrow-raising team selection by the time Salzburg had raced into their early 2-0 lead with alarming ease.<br><br>Certainly, few would have predicted Leigh Griffiths would be chosen to lead the line for Celtic. The striker was handed his first starting appearance since August, a decision by<br><br>Deila which spoke volumes of &pound;2.2 million signing Stefan Scepovic&rsquo;s struggles to make a positive impact at the club.<br><br>CONNECT WITH THE SCOTSMAN<br><br>&bull; Subscribe to our daily newsletter (requires registration) and get the latest news, sport and business headlines delivered to your inbox every morning<br><br>&bull; You can also follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Google +<br><br>Scepovic was joined on the substitutes&rsquo; bench by Kris Commons and James Forrest, with Callum McGregor and Johansen given the supporting roles behind Griffiths as Deila favoured running power over flair in those positions.<br><br>But, if the Norwegian had hoped it would help his team match the pressing tactics and dynamism of the visitors, he was left to think again by Salzburg&rsquo;s high-octane start to the contest. Frankly, Celtic could consider themselves fortunate only to concede twice in a torrid opening 25 minutes.<br><br>There was a touch of fortune about the visitors&rsquo; opener in the eighth minute, although it was also attributable to Celtic&rsquo;s inability to cope with the pace and movement of their opponents, who were determined to play on the front foot. Massimo Bruno cut in from the left to work a shooting position from around 20 yards and his effort deflected off Charlie Mulgrew. The ball spun kindly into the path of Alan who was left with the fairly simple task of slotting it beyond Craig Gordon from close range.<br><br>Celtic were visibly rattled and needed Gordon to make a sharp save to keep out Martin Hinteregger&rsquo;s close-range header from a Jonatan Soriano free-kick as Salzburg went for the jugular. But the second goal was only delayed until the 13th minute.<br><br>The home team&rsquo;s defending left much to be desired when Kevin Kampl floated over a corner from the right. Salzburg central defender Andre Ramalho was able to flick it on to the unattended Alan who again made no mistake with a firm finish beyond Gordon from a couple of yards out.<br><br>Celtic had a half-hearted appeal for a penalty turned down when McGregor went down under Hinteregger&rsquo;s challenge but it was Salzburg who continued to dominate. Gordon was soon called into action again, getting down low to his right to keep out Peter Ankersen&rsquo;s effort from around 20 yards.<br><br>Gordon&rsquo;s net bulged again in the 22nd minute but on this occasion a fine exhibition of Soriano&rsquo;s technical ability was wasted by the Salzburg captain who, despite clear direction from the referee that a free-kick was indirect, curled the ball directly on target.<br><br>Mercifully for Celtic, the Salzburg onslaught gradually abated and the complexion of the contest was altered dramatically when Deila&rsquo;s men pulled a goal back with their first cohesive attacking move of the evening in the 30th minute.<br><br>Emilio Izaguirre stretched the Salzburg defence with a powerful surge down the left and his low cross picked out a well-timed run into the penalty area from Johansen, who neatly drilled a shot beyond the right hand of goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi into the corner of the net.<br><br>Celtic sought to gather some momentum at the start of the second half as they managed to secure a greater share of possession. They almost equalised in fortuitous fashion in the 50th minute, a corner from the left by Anthony Stokes smacking off Gulacsi&rsquo;s crossbar with the keeper scrambling unconvincingly.<br><br>News that Dinamo Zagreb had fallen behind to Astra in Romania may have reduced the significance of defeat for Celtic but it made them no less anxious to avoid it as they tried to increase their tempo in the attacking third of the pitch.<br><br>Salzburg were now posing a rarer threat of their own, mostly on the counter attack, although Soriano missed a good chance to restore their two-goal advantage when he sliced a shot wide.<br><br>Deila made a double substitution in the 67th minute, Commons and Forrest replacing Stokes and McGregor in a reconfigured front four which pushed Johansen out to the left.<br><br>Griffiths had toiled for much of the evening to make a telling contribution but he was denied his first European goal for Celtic 13 minutes from time when his close-range header from<br><br>Izaguirre&rsquo;s cross was well saved by Gulacsi.<br><br>It was as close as Celtic came to an equaliser and they were undone in the second minute of stoppage time when Keita headed beyond Gordon after the keeper could only parry Marcel Sabitzer&rsquo;s shot into his path.<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>BBC<br>By Richard Wilson BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br><br> Celtic progress as runners-up from Group D<br> Alan double for Salzburg inside 13 minutes<br> Stefan Johansen on target for Celtic<br> Stoppage-time goal from Naby Keita as Salzburg win group<br><br>Celtic qualified for the knockout stage of the Europa League despite falling to defeat at home to Salzburg.<br><br>Salzburg&#39;s win secured the Austrian&#39;s top spot in Group D, with Alan scoring twice in the first-half and Naby Keita adding another late on.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s riposte came from Stefan Johansen and they played more assuredly after the break, but they were undone by Salzburg&#39;s initial zeal.<br><br>Astra defeat Dynamo Zagreb in Romania to ensure Celtic finished second.<br><br>Celtic were immediately swamped.

The home side were overwhelmed.<br><br>Salzburg came into the game as the highest scorers in the competition and the effectiveness of their attack was clear.<br><br>There was an element of good fortune about the early goal.

It took 30 minutes for a foray to become meaningful, but when Emilio Izaguirre hurled in a cross from the left Johansen finished crisply and accurately.<br><br>The goal revived the Celtic support and brought renewed purpose to the home side. It was clear why Salzburg have such an impressive European record though, because they were unfazed. They kept their poise but also their sense of adventure, and one counter-attack took just three quick passes to cover the length of the field.<br><br>Celtic were more composed after the interval. They lacked a cutting edge, though, which prompted some fans to holler for James Forrest to be brought on. The sense was that if the game was to be rescued, Celtic needed to be more threatening.<br><br>There was a reminder, too, of the danger the visitors still carried. A break upfield saw Soriano and Bruno exchange passes, but the former finished weakly from the edge of the area, sending the ball trundling wide.<br><br>Salzburg were capable of a casual aplomb, but they could also be unnerved. Celtic came close when Leigh Griffiths saw a header from Izaguirre&#39;s cross saved, but the equaliser wouldn&#39;t come.<br><br>Instead, the substitute Keita added a third with a header after a Salzburg counter attack. <br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 1, FC Red Bull Salzburg 3.<br>90:00 +3:05 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 1, FC Red Bull Salzburg 3.<br>90:00 +2:51<br><br>Stefan Johansen (Celtic) wins a free kick in the defensive half.<br>90:00 +2:51<br><br>Foul by Alan (FC Red Bull Salzburg).<br>90:00 +2:21<br><br>Attempt missed.
