Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images<br><br>Drama   had been given the afternoon off and there was only joy for Celtic.   With just ten minutes gone, Neil Lennon&#39;s side had, in effect, clinched   the Scottish Premier League title with two of the goals in a 6-0 win. A   single point would have sufficed, but the visitors had no intention of   operating to tight margins. Kilmarnock, who had beaten Celtic recently   in the League Cup final, showed none of the competitiveness  demonstrated  then.<br><br>It has been of some help to Neil Lennon&#39;s  side that  Rangers had ten points deducted for going into  administration, but the  lead for Celtic would have been comfortable  even without that sanction.  There was little to fear in this game and  the prize has been secured  with five matches left on the schedule.<br><br>The  atmosphere at Rugby  Park was unusually reassuring for the visitors  since the Ayrshire club  had allocated three sides of the ground to the  Celtic support. In  contrast to that recent final, there was nothing  material at stake for  Kilmarnock. All the same, that mood , in its own  way, could have  constituted a potential menace if the opposition had  been relaxed and  audacious.<br><br>That was well understood by Celtic  players determined  to be unrelenting. Kilmarnock, for their part,  performed as if no one  had warned them that a lively occasion was  inevitable. The hunger,  understandably, was Celtic&#39;s, yet the  opposition seemed taken aback by  the intensity of Neil Lennon&#39;s side. A  corner from Ki Sung-yueng was  headed home in the eighth minute by the  devastating Charlie Mulgrew,  whose exuberance and skill were  uncontainable.<br><br>Mulgrew then  picked out Glen Loovens to finish  with a header two minutes later.  Celtic led 3-0 by the 36th minute,  when the uncontainable left-back  finished with an impeccable shot.  There seemed no end to his appetite  for the contest, with Mulgrew  paving the way for the volley by Gary  Hooper that put Celtic 4-0 ahead  at the interval. Joe Ledley took a  fifth goal in the 87th minute,  before Hooper fired into the top corner.<br><br>This  emphatic win  testified to Lennon&#39;s work. He was appointed to the post  on a permanent  basis in the summer of 2010, having initially held it on a  caretaker  capacity after the sacking of Tony Mowbray.

The full-back scored twice and provided the assist for Glenn    Loovens&#39; and Gary Hooper&#39;s goals.<br><br>Joe  Ledley and Hooper rubbed   salt into the Kilmarnock wounds with two late  goals to round off an   emphatic win and kick-start the title  celebrations.<br><br>Celtic   arrived at Rugby Park knowing a point would  seal their 43rd Scottish   League title. Neil Lennon&rsquo;s men also had the  added incentive of   exacting revenge against Kilmarnock who beat them in  the Scottish   League Cup final last month.<br><br>Neil Lennon made three  changes to   the side which beat St Johnstone last week. Kelvin Wilson,  Adam   Matthews and Sung-Yueng Ki were all recalled to the starting  line-up.<br><br>Kilmarnock   manager Kenny Shiels was forced into one  change from his side&#39;s last   match as Garry Hay came in for the on-loan  Louis Toshney, who was   unable to play against his parent club.  Meanwhile, top scorer Paul   Heffernen returned from injury but was only  fit enough to make the   bench.<br><br>Rugby Park was sold out with  thousands of Celtic fans   making the trip hoping to see their side clinch  the league title. The   Bhoys were visibly spurred on by the travelling  support and were from   the first minute, knocking the ball about with  ease with the home side   chasing shadows.<br><br>It took only seven  minutes for Celtic to get   the party started as Mulgrew headed in his  seventh goal of the season   from a corner. Ki&rsquo;s delivery from the left  hand side was met by the   defender, who timed his run into the area  perfectly and connected with a   bullet of a header leaving Cammy Bell  with no chance.<br><br>The   visitors doubled their lead in the 16th  minute through Loovens&rsquo; first   goal of the season. Goalscorer Mulgrew  turned provider this time,   dropping his shoulder and floating a ball  into the back post which was   headed home by the centre-half to spark  wild celebrations from the  away  supporters.<br><br>Kilmarnock looked  vulnerable from set-pieces  and it  could have easily been 3-0 to Celtic  had Loovens been able to  direct  his header from a corner away from Bell  in the Kilmarnock goal  in the  22nd minute.<br><br>It was half an hour  before the home side  had decent  possession in the Celtic half but they  failed to make  anything from it  and allowed the visitors to clear their  lines easily  before they  struck again.<br><br>The ball was played up  the field to  Mulgrew, this  time on the left hand side, he cut in onto  his right  foot and curled  home his second and Celtic&rsquo;s third, all but  wrapping  up the title in  the process in the 35th minute.<br><br>Kilmarnock&rsquo;s   hapless defence was  immediately exposed again as Common&rsquo;s collected the   ball inside the  area and laid it off for Georgios Samaras whose   close-range shot forced  a fine save from Bell.<br><br>Rugby Park was a cauldron of noise with all of it coming from the visiting fans whilsts the Kilmarnock crowd was very subdued.<br><br>The    hosts tried to rally in attack as the first half drew to a close and    sent a few bodies forward in search of a goal. However, it only served    as an invitation for Celtic to hit them on the counterattack as  Hooper   got in on the act this time, turning home Mulgrew&rsquo;s cross with a  smart   finish to make it 4-0 to Celtic at half-time.<br><br>Kilmarnock  started   the second half with more purpose and had their best moment  of the   match in the 53rd minute. Dean Shiels had an effort on goal  comfortably   kept out by Fraser Forster before the rebound was blazed  over the bar  by  James Fowler.<br><br>Dean Shiels and Mahamadou Sissoko  both picked  up  cautions early in the second half as the home side  again grew  frustrated  by their failure to maintain possession.<br><br>Loovens   nearly got his  second of the match, and his second of the season, as   Celtic charged  down the pitch on the counterattack. The Dutchman could   not convert  Mulgrew&rsquo;s cross for a fifth goal as Bell came rushing out   to smother the  chance.<br><br>Anthony Stokes came off the bench and had a chance to make it five for Celtic but misfired his shot when through on goal.<br><br>Man    of the match Mulgrew was given a standing ovation from the Celtic  fans   when he was replaced by Andre Blackman in the 77th minute.<br><br>With the match petering out, Ledley provided the icing on the cake with a goal in the 89th minute.<br><br>And,    before the Celtic fans had finished celebrating that Ledley strike,    Hooper got his second of the match with a beautiful half-volley, making    it 6-0 to the visitors and sparking wild celebrations from the    travelling support.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>  </h3><h3>   Chief Executive: This is a proud day for the Celtic Family</h3><br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 07 Apr, 2012 17:20<br>Official Site<br><br>IT   was a day when the Celtic family celebrated. Whether it was the 14,000   supporters who packed into Rugby Park and made the ground a sea of  green  and white, or the millions around the world, Celtic fans  everywhere  enjoyed seeing the SPL title return to Paradise.<br><br>And  for Celtic  Chief Executive Peter Lawwell, it was also a day of pride &ndash;  pride in the  manager and his backroom staff, the players and, of  course, the  supporters. It was, as the Chief Executive told the  official Celtic  website, &ldquo;a magnificent day of entertaining, winning  football.<br><br>&ldquo;I&acute;m  very proud of Neil and what he&acute;s achieved,&rdquo; he  continued. &ldquo;I&acute;m proud of  Alan Thompson, Johan Mjallby, Garry Parker,  Stevie Woods. It was a huge  triumph for them today, particularly for  Neil on the back of what he&acute;s  had to put up with in the past couple of  years, and he&acute;s won it - he&acute;s  now a championship-winning manager.<br><br>&ldquo;And  our supporters were  magnificent today, as they have been throughout  this season, and there&rsquo;s  a smile on their faces &ndash; those who were there  today, those who couldn&rsquo;t  make it, the millions of fans around the  world.<br><br>&ldquo;Seeing how  proud they are of their club is really  satisfying because it&rsquo;s been  painful the past three years. There hasn&rsquo;t  been a day that&rsquo;s gone by  when we haven&rsquo;t thought about getting the  title back where it truly  belongs and thankfully we did that today.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic  secured the SPL  title with a scintillating 6-0 victory over Kilmarnock  at Rugby Park,  and with the average age of the team just 23, the  future looks bright  for the club.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a young team with a lot  of ability and it&rsquo;s a  fantastic foundation to go forward with,&rdquo; said  Peter Lawwell. &ldquo;But  today&rsquo;s not the end. We&rsquo;ve got to move and get this  great club back in  the Champions League and perform there regularly,  and we&rsquo;ve got a great  basis to do that.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really proud of the players. They are young and what they&rsquo;ve achieved is fantastic&rdquo;<br><br>And   the Chief Executive also highlighted the togetherness which exists at   Celtic, a quality which has helped deliver the SPL title back to   Paradise.<br><br>&ldquo;There is a great unity at the club which is a   tremendous strength,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d like to pay credit to the board   who have believed in us, stuck by us, guided us through this period.<br><br>&ldquo;And   also to Dermot Desmond, whose wisdom, advice and patience over that   period has been fantastic, so from the top through the management, the   players, and supporters, there&rsquo;s a magnificent unity at the club which   is a real strength.<br><br>&ldquo;This is just the beginning. We have a duty   to take this club as far as we can go. Hopefully everybody has a great   day, a great weekend and celebrates a magnificent Celtic victory once   again.&rdquo;<br><br><br><h3>Paradise set for special trophy day party</h3><br>By: Newsroom Staff on 07 Apr, 2012 15:29<br><br>CELTIC&acute;S   6-0 victory over Kilmarnock at Rugby Park has confirmed Neil Lennon&acute;s   side as the SPL Champions for 2011/12.

This  is  just the beginning...<br><br>Manager: The best day of my  professional  life By: Mark Henderson on 07 Apr, 2012 15:13 NEIL Lennon  has described  Celtic&acute;s League Championship triumph<br><br><br><br><h3>Celtic crowned Champions at Rugby Park</h3><br>By: Laura Brannan on 07 Apr, 2012 14:15<br><br>April 7, 2012<br>Scottish Premier League<br>Rugby Park<br><br>KILMARNOCK 0 <br><br>CELTIC 6<br>(Mulgrew 8, 35, Loovens 17, Hooper 45, 89, Ledley 88)<br><br>CELTIC   were crowned Champions at Rugby Park with an outstanding 6-0 victory   against Kilmarnock, sending them 21 points clear at the top of the SPL   and securing the first title triumph under Neil Lennon. <br><br>The   emphatic victory was completed by a stylish performance in front of   14,000 travelling Celtic supporters in Ayrshire, thanks to two goals   from Charlie Mulgrew and a double from Gary Hooper along with strikes   from Glenn Loovens and Joe Ledley.<br><br>With the Celtic fans filling   three of the four stands at Rugby Park, and the team only needing a   point to secure the title, the afternoon promised so much for the Bhoys.   And it wasn&rsquo;t long before the celebrations got underway.<br><br>The   Hoops made a blistering start to proceedings and with only eight minutes   on the clock, Mulgrew rose above everyone inside the penalty box to   head home a corner. The visitors looked hungry and the early lead was   more than deserved as they settled any possible nerves.<br><br>And   continuing their excellent start, Celtic doubled their lead nine minutes   later. This time Mulgrew turned provider as he picked up a corner on   the edge of the box and sent the ball to the back post. Loovens, who had   kept his place in defence after last weekend, headed it in from inside   the six-yard box.<br><br>With Celtic two goals ahead they looked   comfortable and continued to display a high tempo of football. Ki Sung   Yueng, one of the three players to come back into the side, along with   Adam Matthews and Kelvin Wilson, took a free-kick on 28 minutes. He   curled it over the wall but Cammy Bell pulled off a wonderful diving   save to keep the South Korean out.<br><br>Celtic didn&rsquo;t have long to   wait for their third, though, as the Charlie Mulgrew show continued on   35 minutes. The defender made a fantastic run down the left flank after   picking up Kris Commons&acute; through ball, and did the hard work himself,   twisting away from his marker and slotting it past Bell.<br><br>The   Hoops had the chance to add another 12 minutes later when Commons   collected the ball in the centre of the penalty box. Weighing up his   options, he made an acute turn to play in Georgios Samaras and the Greek   forced Bell into another good save. <br><br>But just on the verge of   half-time, Mulgrew set up Celtic&acute;s fourth of the afternoon. He crossed   the ball to Hooper at the far post, who calmly slotted it past Bell from   close-range, sending the Hoops into the break with the points already   secure.<br><br>Kilmarnock started the second-half stronger, and didn&rsquo;t   let the scoreline stop them from pushing forward, but they couldn&rsquo;t   create any real chances to trouble Fraser Forster. <br><br>Under-19s&acute;   star, Filip Twardzik, was given his third run out in the first-team,   replacing Scott Brown shortly after the break as the Hoops continued   their outstanding display. <br><br>Loovens had a chance to add to his   tally on the hour mark when he broke through and collected Commons&acute;   pass. But the Dutch defender collided with Bell as he took the shot and   fell to the deck as his effort cracked off the post.<br><br>Samaras   tried tirelessly to get on to the score-sheet before he was substituted   by Anthony Stokes, who also came close to adding to Celtic&acute;s tally. But   the late drama came from Ledley and Hooper instead.<br><br>The  Welshman  added a fifth with a stylish turn inside the box and a  clinical finish  past Bell before Hooper sealed the wrapped up  proceedings 60 seconds  later. The striker added his second of the  afternoon, sending a  delightful strike into the top corner, leaving  Bell with no chance.<br><br>The  full-time whistle then followed,  sparking scenes of jubilation as the  three points moved Celtic onto 81  points, securing the league title.<br><br>KILMARNOCK  (4-4-2): Bell;  Gordon (Barbour 46), Nelson, Sissoko, Johnston; Hay  (Dayton 46),  Fowler, Kelly, Harkins; Van Tornhout (Heffernan 61), Shiels<br>Subs not used: Letheren, Racchi, Pursehouse, Kennedy<br><br>CELTIC   (4-4-2): Forster; Matthews, Loovens, K.
