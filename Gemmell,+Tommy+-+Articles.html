Lisbon in 1967. What could surpass that?<br><br>&quot;Winning the European Cup was something that happened to the likes of Real Madrid, Benfica and Inter Milan.<br><br>&quot;Then  along came some upstarts from Glasgow and we were crowned the best in  Europe. The warm tingle at the memory of that day will never leave me.<br><br>&quot;Coming  back from a goal down to Inter Milan, who had won the trophy two out of  the previous three years, and to triumph 2-1 was just so special.<br><br>&quot;Getting  the equaliser was breath-taking and being part of the build-up for  Stevie Chalmers&#39; winner was just superb. I played and scored against  Feyenoord three years later in another European Cup Final, but this time  we lost 2-1.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a bad sport, but we were three  minutes away from a replay when Ove Kindvall scored the winner in  extra-time and we&#39;d have beaten them in a second game. They took us by  surprise in the San Siro, we weren&#39;t prepared for them. It would not  have been the case in a replay.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s strange to think I would leave Celtic a year later. I didn&#39;t see that one on the cards.<br><br>&quot;Jock  Stein was beginning to change things and the likes of John Clark,  Chalmers, Bertie Auld, Willie Wallace and John Hughes were all on the  way out.<br><br>&quot;Eventually, I caught up with them. To be honest, I didn&#39;t want to go.<br><br>&quot;I  fell out with Big Jock when he dropped me from the team that won the  1969 League Cup. I was sent off playing for Scotland against West  Germany in the midweek and believe this was some sort of punishment from  Celtic. I still don&#39;t know whether the decision was made by the manager  or the board. I sat out the win over St Johnstone and then saw Big Jock  on the Sunday and slapped in a transfer request.<br><br>&quot;I was on the list for two years! These were the days before Bosman deals and the clubs held your registration.<br><br>&quot;If they didn&#39;t want you to leave there was nothing you could do about it.<br><br>&quot;I  knew there was interest in me as six different clubs, including  Barcelona, who were managed by an Englishman called Vic Buckingham, got  in touch with me.<br><br>&quot;However, when I asked Big Jock almost on a  daily basis if there was a club in for me he would say &#39;Naw, I&#39;ll keep  you informed, Tommy&#39;.<br><br>&quot;That was that. I was never in a rush to leave and I suspect Big Jock knew that. It certainly wasn&#39;t about money.<br><br>&quot;In 1967 when we won the European Cup I was on a basic wage of &pound;40 per week plus &pound;10 per point.<br><br>&quot;Before  I left for Nottingham Forest I was picking up &pound;60 per week. Forest  TREBLED my basic wage to &pound;180 and there were all sorts of other perks,  including &pound;40 per point. I was better off financially, but I really  missed being a Celtic player. That meant more than money.&quot;<br><br>Gemmell,  who scored 64 goals in 418 appearances for the Parkhead outfit,  believes football isn&#39;t half as exciting as it was in his day.<br><br>He adds: &quot;Back in the 60s every team in Scotland had fabulous individuals, the type of players who&#39;d get fans going to games.<br><br>&quot;I  just don&#39;t see them around these days. For whatever reason, these crowd  pleasers seem to have fallen off the Scottish radar and that&#39;s a real  pity.&quot;<br><br>Gemmell, who won six titles, three Scottish Cups, four  League Cups and, of course, a European Cup in the Hoops, was rarely  turned over as a player.<br><br>He does recall one opponent who ran him ragged.<br><br>He  added: &quot;It was back in 1964 and we were 3-0 up on MTK Budapest in the  first leg of the European Cup Winners&#39; Cup semi-final. In the return we  were told to attack, as is the Celtic way, and were hammered 4-0. They  had a little outside-right called Sandor who made life hell for me that  night. Thank goodness there weren&#39;t too many like him.&quot; Tommy still  watches his beloved Celtic and said: &quot;It might not be vintage stuff,  but, hopefully, they will get there under Neil Lennon.&quot;</font> <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR HISTORY &ndash; THE CELTIC LEGEND OF TOMMY GEMMELL</h3><br>By David Potter (from KeepTheFaith Website)<br><br>Tommy  Gemmell in many ways typified the Lisbon Lions. He was brash,  swaggering, confident and full of desire to do well. He was a character  of the late 1960s and early 1970s, seldom off the pages of the newspaper  or off the TV screen, and he remained with the fans a very popular  character. And with cause. He is one of very few players to have scored  in two European Cup Finals.<br><br>Born in 1943, he was 18 when he  joined Celtic from Coltness United in 1961. He made his debut for the  team in an evil hour. It was January 5th 1963 at Aberdeen , 4 days after  a dreadful 0-4 beating at Ibrox. As a result of this, wholesale changes  had to be made, and Celtic had a new full back pairing of Ian Young and  Tommy Gemmell. The memory remains of these two strapping youngsters  that cold miserable day at Pittodrie, their hair brushed back, tackling  ferociously everything that came over the halfway line (&quot;that East Wind  fae the North Sea didna even get by them&quot;) as Celtic showed everyone how  well they could play by beating the home side 5-1.<br><br>But we would  see little more of Tommy that season, for the big freeze came and Tom  was relegated to the reserves as the team struggled, struggled and  finally collapsed on that awful night at Hampden when the Celtic End  went home half an hour early.<br><br>1963-4 saw Tom given his chance,  and he took it. He made his mistakes, as everyone else did that year,  but the form of the side improved and given a little more luck, success  in Scotland and Europe did not seem all that far away.<br><br>But it  was, and New Year 1965 saw Celtic on their knees, until Chairman Kelly  admitted that he had been wrong and sent out the begging bowl for Jock  Stein. The arrival of the Big Man galvanised everyone into action, even  though Tommy was given a row the very first night for showing off too  much as an attacking full back.<br><br>It was however an attacking full  back that Tommy was destined to be, and for the next five glorious  years, Tommy was part of the Celtic team that re-wrote history. Tommy  shot from a distance, took penalties, scored goals, mopped up everything  down the left wing (putting Willie Henderson of Rangers out of  business) and even showed his versatility by playing on the right on  occasion, notably in the first half of the 1966-7 season when Gemmell  and O&#39;Neill was the full back partnership.<br><br>He even played in goal one time when Ronnie Simpson was injured!<br><br>Tommy  won 18 caps for Scotland , famously in the 1967, 3-2 Wembley victory -  something that Gemmell took in his stride between Semi Finals of the  European Cup!<br><br>Lisbon saw his great goal and his part in the great  triumph, and for the next year or so, Gemmell could do no wrong. But,  as with all great Scottish geniuses, self-destruction is never far away.  He meted out his private piece of revenge to an Argentinian thug in  1967 and escaped the notice of the referee, if not the BBC. But he was  less lucky when playing for Scotland in October 1969. His &quot;red mist&quot;  tackle on Haller saw him sent off to destroy what little chance Scotland  had, and when he returned to Scotland to play in the League Cup Final  against St. Johnstone, Jock Stein dropped him. Relationships between the  two men would never be the same again.<br><br>Tommy took his goal well  in the European Cup Final in Milan in 1970, but cannot entirely escape  censure for his part in the disgraceful defeat. The attitude was simply  not right - and this was something that could not have been said of  Tommy Gemmell in the past. He had been a show-off, yes, but totally  professional. This could not have been said of the Milan preparations in  1970, and swollen heads were fairly obviously a factor in that  heart-rending defeat.<br><br>That summer of 1970 got worse when Tommy  Gemmell and Bertie Auld were sent home from a tour of North America by  Sean Fallon for disciplinary reasons.<br><br>Tommy would have one more  season with Celtic, but by the end of it, Jock Stein, who had given  every sign of wishing to get rid of Gemmell, found a place for Jim  Brogan at left back, and early in the following season, Tommy was off to  Notts Forest.<br><br>He would soon return to Scotland to play for and  manage Dundee, and on at least two occasions he would get the better of  Celtic. One was in that dreadful League Cup Final of 1973 when Celtic  fans, huddled together in the enclosure were reduced to the old Rangers  chant of &quot;Gemmell&#39;s a B......&quot;, and the other was on a windy day at Dens  Park when a 5-1 victory for Dundee effectively deprived Celtic of the  1980 League Championship.<br><br>Tommy does play to the gallery on  occasion, nowhere more so than in a recent book where he claimed that  someone on the playing staff at Parkhead (significantly, he does not  name names) called him an &quot;Orange B.......&quot;, because of his religion. At  least two of Tommy&#39;s colleagues are convinced that this was a figment  of Tommy&#39;s imagination, and in any case, Tommy was not the sort of a  chap that one would take liberties with, whether about religion or  anything else. He was more than capable of looking after himself.<br><br>But  the down side of Tommy is almost overwhelmed by his good side. He is a  decent person, a good laugh, and rightly proud of his great playing  record which stands comparison with any Celtic full back in the past,  even Joe Dodds, Danny McGrain, Jock Morrison, Dan Doyle or Barney  Battles.<br><br>Tommy Gemmell was and is a great Celt, as his record of  one European Cup medal, six Scottish League medals, three Scottish Cup  medals and four Scottish League Cup medals (as well as one with Dundee)  proves.<br><br>A few months ago, Tommy was to be seen in the Celtic Pub  of Dunblane (the town in which he lives) watching the Old Firm game and  cheering as the Celts beat the Rangers. He is, as they used to say about  Jimmy Quinn, &quot;just like an ordinary man&quot;.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  Now Tam&rsquo;s in the 67 club</h3>PRIDE OF LIONS ... birthday Bhoy Gemmell still gets a special feeling at being part of Celtic&#39;s European Cup winning side<br>By JOHN SHIELDS, The Sun<br>Published: 15th October 2010<br><br>LISBON  LION Tommy Gemmell celebrates his 67th birthday today with one regret  in a glorious football career &mdash; leaving Celtic in 1971.<br><br>The man  described by Jock Stein as &lsquo;the greatest left-back in the world&rsquo;  reminisced last night about his 33 colourful years in the game.<br><br>It  started in 1961 when he joined Celtic from Junior club Coltness United  and continued as a player at Nottingham Forest, as player/boss at Dundee  and ended as Albion Rovers boss in 1994.<br><br>He grinned: &ldquo;My greatest memories?

The warm tingle at the memory of that day will never leave me.<br><br>&ldquo;Coming  back from a goal down to Inter Milan, who had won the trophy two out of  the previous three years, and to triumph 2-1 was just so special.<br><br>&ldquo;Getting  the equaliser was breath-taking and being part of the build-up for  Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; winner was just superb. I played and scored against  Feyenoord three years later in another European Cup Final, but this time  we lost 2-1.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a bad sport, but we were three  minutes away from a replay when Ove Kindvall scored the winner in  extra-time and we&rsquo;d have beaten them in a second game. They took us by  surprise in the San Siro, we weren&rsquo;t prepared for them. It would not  have been the case in a replay.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange to think I would leave Celtic a year later. I didn&rsquo;t see that one on the cards.<br><br>&ldquo;Jock  Stein was beginning to change things and the likes of John Clark,  Chalmers, Bertie Auld, Willie Wallace and John Hughes were all on the  way out.<br><br>&ldquo;Eventually, I caught up with them. To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t want to go.<br><br>&ldquo;I  fell out with Big Jock when he dropped me from the team that won the  1969 League Cup. I was sent off playing for Scotland against West  Germany in the midweek and believe this was some sort of punishment from  Celtic. I still don&rsquo;t know whether the decision was made by the manager  or the board. I sat out the win over St Johnstone and then saw Big Jock  on the Sunday and slapped in a transfer request.<br><br>&ldquo;I was on the list for two years! These were the days before Bosman deals and the clubs held your registration.<br><br>&ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t want you to leave there was nothing you could do about it.<br><br>&ldquo;I  knew there was interest in me as six different clubs, including  Barcelona, who were managed by an Englishman called Vic Buckingham, got  in touch with me.<br><br>&ldquo;However, when I asked Big Jock almost on a  daily basis if there was a club in for me he would say &lsquo;Naw, I&rsquo;ll keep  you informed, Tommy&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;That was that. I was never in a rush to leave and I suspect Big Jock knew that. It certainly wasn&rsquo;t about money.<br><br>mpu<br><br>&ldquo;In 1967 when we won the European Cup I was on a basic wage of &pound;40 per week plus &pound;10 per point.<br><br>&ldquo;Before  I left for Nottingham Forest I was picking up &pound;60 per week. Forest  TREBLED my basic wage to &pound;180 and there were all sorts of other perks,  including &pound;40 per point. I was better off financially, but I really  missed being a Celtic player. That meant more than money.&rdquo;<br><br>Gemmell,  who scored 64 goals in 418 appearances for the Parkhead outfit,  believes football isn&rsquo;t half as exciting as it was in his day.<br><br>He adds: &ldquo;Back in the 60s every team in Scotland had fabulous individuals, the type of players who&rsquo;d get fans going to games.<br><br>&ldquo;I  just don&rsquo;t see them around these days. For whatever reason, these crowd  pleasers seem to have fallen off the Scottish radar and that&rsquo;s a real  pity.&rdquo;<br><br>Gemmell, who won six titles, three Scottish Cups, four  League Cups and, of course, a European Cup in the Hoops, was rarely  turned over as a player.<br><br>He does recall one opponent who ran him ragged.<br><br>He  added: &ldquo;It was back in 1964 and we were 3-0 up on MTK Budapest in the  first leg of the European Cup Winners&rsquo; Cup semi-final. In the return we  were told to attack, as is the Celtic way, and were hammered 4-0. They  had a little outside-right called Sandor who made life hell for me that  night. Thank goodness there weren&rsquo;t too many like him.&rdquo; Tommy still  watches his beloved Celtic and said: &ldquo;It might not be vintage stuff,  but, hopefully, they will get there under Neil Lennon.&rdquo;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Tommy Gemmell: I reduced Scotland boss Gordon Strachan to tears the night I busted him and Jinky for boozing<br></h3><a class="external" href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tommy-gemmell-reduced-scotland-boss-3542138" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tommy-gemmell-reduced-scotland-boss-3542138</a><h3>May 2014<br><br></h3>THE   decision to pair Gordon Strachan with Jimmy Johnstone as training pals   at Dundee was the easiest this manager ever had to make.<br><div class="spoiler"><br>The   youthful Strachan, full of infectious enthusiasm and energy, would  spark  my wee pal Jinky as he approached the twilight stages of his  career at  Dens Park.<br><br>It worked so well too &ndash; for a few days  anyway, until  Gordon picked up a toe infection and the Wee Man went  down with a  strain. Pretty soon, they were both nursing mighty sore  heads.<br><br>I  thought I had pulled off the signing coup of the  century when I tempted  my old Lisbon Lion team-mate to Tayside during  my first few weeks as  boss. The Wee Man, far right, had left Celtic two  years earlier in 1975  on a free transfer, first to San Jose  Earthquakes then Sheffield United.<br><br>After  his stint in England,  Jinky was up for grabs. He was only 32 and there  was still mileage in  those little legs. The whole town was buzzing when  he arrived.<br><br>I  had no doubts about Gordon&rsquo;s dedication and  application and he was  also a man of his word. I was told Manchester  United had offered him a  trial before he signed for Dundee. But he  wouldn&rsquo;t go back on his  promise, rejected United and put pen to paper on  schoolboy forms at  Dens.<br><br>Gordon was in awe of Jinky, who had  also taken a shine to  the fresh-faced teenager, so much so he invited  him for lunch at  Dundee&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Hotel when they were both laid up with  their  respective knocks. The drink was flowing but there was one  problem.  Gordy was no drinker. He was a lightweight but would have been  trying  to keep pace with Jinky without realising how much he was  consuming.<br><br>He  always admitted he wasn&rsquo;t in the same league as  Jinky as a footballer.  He discovered that day he wasn&rsquo;t in the same  league as a drinker,  either. Not many were.<br><br>A barman at the Queen&rsquo;s later told me they had consumed four bottles of wine with their meal.<br><br>They should have gone for a kip. Instead, they went to Gordon&rsquo;s place, had more drinks and a kickabout with kids in the street.<br><br>After   that, it was off to the pub, then another pub. They must have been   puggled by then as someone thought it would be a great idea to get a   taxi to Errol and have a few more in the Central Hotel.<br><br>It wasn&rsquo;t   a very good idea as the hotel was 50 yards across the road from the   Commercial Hotel, where the proprietor, of course, was a certain T   Gemmell Esq.<br><br>One of my regulars came in. He asked: &ldquo;Tommy, did   you know two of your players are at the Central trying to drink the   place dry?&rdquo;<br><br>Not for the first time my heart sank. I asked: &ldquo;Jinky   and who else?&rdquo; My mole said sheepishly: &ldquo;Wee Gordon Strachan. He&rsquo;s   blootered. Wee Jinky&rsquo;s no&rsquo; much better.&rdquo;<br><br>I was fuming. How stupid   could they be? It was bad enough going on a pub crawl but to do it  just  across the road from their manager was unbelievable.<br><br>I  marched  across the road, just in time to see Strachan staggering  through the  door. He weaved unsteadily towards me without lifting his  head. &ldquo;Where  the f*** are you going?&rdquo; I bellowed.<br><br>&ldquo;Where the f*** am I going? I don&rsquo;t even know where the f*** I am,&rdquo; slurred Strachan.<br><br>&ldquo;Do you know who you&rsquo;re talking to?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t even know who I am.&rdquo;<br><br>I   wasn&rsquo;t sure if he was trying to be funny. Then he focused, blinked one   eye, and managed to make out my image and burst into tears.<br><br>&ldquo;Sorry, boss,&rdquo; he uttered. &ldquo;Sorry, sorry, boss. I don&rsquo;t suppose you could get me a taxi?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;Get   over the road,&rdquo; I ordered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll deal with you in a moment.&rdquo; I then   went into the bar to give Jinky a piece of my mind but the wee bugger   had scarpered. The sixth sense that came to his aid so often on the   football pitch worked just as well when he was blotto off it.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve   just missed him, Tommy,&rdquo; the barman told me. &ldquo;He left a couple of   minutes ago.&rdquo; I caught up with Gordon and he was crying, &ldquo;Sorry, boss,   really, really sorry. Can you get me a taxi?&rdquo;<br><br>There was no point   giving him a dressing down as he was out the game so I got him home and   waited for Jinky gracing my establishment with his presence.<br><br>At   2am, there was a racket at the front door. I opened it and there was  the  Wee Man. Putting it mildly, he was the worse for wear. Before I  could  say a word, he looked up, bleary-eyed, and muttered: &ldquo;Ach, we  were just  having a wee bit fun.&rdquo;<br><br>I huckled him to his room and  chucked him  into his bed. As I closed the door behind me I heard a  muffled: &ldquo;Ach, it  was only a couple of f****** drinks.&rdquo;<br><br>Once  they had sobered up, I  had an old-fashioned heart-to-heart with both.  Gordon swore it would  never happen again and, as far as I know, that  remained the case  throughout his career.<br><br>At least Jinky did him a  huge favour that  day. He was contrite, too. &ldquo;It just got a wee bit out  of hand,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it coming. Sorry, Big Man.&rdquo;<br><br>I  was heartbroken  things didn&rsquo;t work out for Jinky at Dundee. It could  have turned out to  be a grand finale to a wonderful career. He started  only two games for  us and made a substitute appearance in another. We  knew it was all over  after about three months.<br><br>His contract was  terminated and my  heart plummeted like a stone. As his taxi took off  from Dens, I couldn&rsquo;t  help but wonder about the Wee Man&rsquo;s destination.</div><h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Tommy Gemmell: Jock Stein cost me my dream move to Barcelona - but I always loved him<br><br></h3><a class="external" href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tommy-gemmell-jock-stein-cost-3548194" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/tommy-gemmell-jock-stein-cost-3548194</a><div class="spoiler_toggle"><br>May 2014</div><div class="spoiler">JOCK Stein lied to me almost every day for over two years and ditched me from the Celtic team two hours before a cup final.<br><br>He dropped me into the reserves without warning and thought nothing of berating me in front of my colleagues.<br><br>He   booted me out of the club I adored and deprived me of the chance to  say  a last farewell to the fans I rate the best in the world.<br><br>I loved that man &ndash; even though he cost me a move to Barcelona.<br><br>Vic   Buckingham was appointed manager of the Catalan giants in 1970 and was   interested in yours truly after I had asked Big Jock for a transfer in   October 1969.<br><br>I was raging when I was dropped from the team to face St Johnstone in the League Cup Final that year.<br><br>All   this time later and I still don&rsquo;t know why he acted the way he did,   although perhaps Scotland&rsquo;s 3-2 defeat to West Germany in a World Cup   tie in Hamburg three days before the final was a factor.<br><br>They were leading 3-2 and with a minute to go I got into a great position just outside the box, Sepp Maier&rsquo;s goal in my sights.<br><br>I pulled back my right boot but Helmut Haller clipped my heels from behind and the Austrian ref didn&rsquo;t even award a foul.<br><br>I&rsquo;m   not proud of what I did next. I booted the smirking Haller up the   backside and the ref didn&rsquo;t miss that. Off I went, seeing red in more   ways than one, and 60 seconds later the final whistle blew.<br><br>Big   Jock was with the official SFA party on the flight home and didn&rsquo;t say a   word to me &ndash; and the silence continued when we went to Troon for our   cup final preparations.<br><br>I had no inkling I wouldn&rsquo;t be playing.   There wasn&rsquo;t the merest suggestion that I would be left out, even as we   arrived at Hampden. I was going through the dressing room door when I   was handed two complimentary tickets.<br><br>I looked over at the No.3   peg and Davie Hay was preparing to start at left back. Big Jock hadn&rsquo;t   even hinted I would be dumped. I was well and truly humiliated.<br><br>The following day I got into my car and raced through to Celtic Park to meet him in his office and ask why I had been dropped.<br><br>He   said he didn&rsquo;t have to give a reason, so I demanded to be put on the   transfer list and it was after that my manager took to telling me   porkies on a regular basis.<br><br>Secretly, I&rsquo;d been told Barcelona   wanted me. Buckingham had been put in charge of them and told to restore   them to their former glories. He wanted to build an attractive,   attacking unit and wanted me to be part of the revolution.<br><br>A   reporter got in touch to see if I would be interested. I told him I   would and waited for the next instalment. I was then told Barcelona had   contacted Celtic about the possibility of a deal.<br><br>I&rsquo;d been  tapped  by the Catalan club. They had made an illegal approach through a  third  party and I would have been in serious trouble if Big Jock had  ever  discovered the truth.<br><br>So, I had to act dumb. I would knock  on his  door every couple of days, look in and ask, &lsquo;Anyone interested  in me,  boss?&rsquo; He rarely even looked in my direction as he waved his big  paw and  said: &lsquo;Naw, I&rsquo;ll keep you informed.&rsquo;<br><br>At the same time, I  was  being told by the press man that Buckingham had asked for a price.  It  was frustrating. Eventually, he couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer and looked   elsewhere for a new left-back.<br><br>I was then told Leicester City  and  Spurs, both in the top flight, were interested. I would ask: &lsquo;Any  bids,  boss?&rsquo; and he would again reply: &lsquo;Naw, I&rsquo;ll keep you informed.&rsquo;<br><br>I   was on that bloody transfer list for just over two years and,  according  to my manager, no one was interested. I was a European  Cup-winner, a  regular international and, according to some, even Big  Jock, the best  left-back in the world. But still I wasn&rsquo;t of any  interest to any other  club on the planet.<br><br>Celtic had a midweek match at Aberdeen right after the 1969 League Cup Final. I wasn&rsquo;t even on the bench as we won 3-2.<br><br>But we had a home European Cup tie against Benfica looming and Jock knew I was a big-game player, which gave him a problem.<br><br>He   couldn&rsquo;t just pitch me in against the Portuguese champions, depending   on me to come up with all the answers in a crucial match. That wouldn&rsquo;t   look too clever.<br><br>I got the nod to play in a league match  against  Hearts on the Saturday before the European tie which denied  headline  writers the chance to scream: &lsquo;Gemmell Back Against Benfica&rdquo;.<br><br>Jock   was a great psychologist. I played against Benfica and scored in the   second minute. I ran to the Jungle to take the applause and then sneaked   a wee look over at him in the dugout.<br><br>I am sure I detected a smile on his lips. He probably expected me to come up with such an answer. Points even, I think.<br><br>I finally did get my move from Celtic when I left for Nottingham Forest some two years after that Benfica game.<br><br>Unfortunately my last game for the club was far from Parkhead &ndash; and the fans &ndash; in a low-key<br><br>European Cup tie in Malta against Sliema Wanderers, a game we won 2-1 for a 7-1 aggregate victory.</div><h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  Tommy Gemmell: Jock Stein was the main reason why I didn&#39;t win more caps for Scotland</h3>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/tommy-gemmell-jock-stein-main-3550065<br> May 16, 2014 12:15<br> By Dailyrecord.co.uk<br><br>THE Lisbon Lion says that his paltry haul of 18 caps was a direct result of the pressure applied by the Celtic manager.<br> <br>Tommy Gemmell on a rare appearance for Scotland<br><br>MY  appearances for Scotland over nine years in top-class football  stretched to a paltry tally of just 18 caps and that was down to one  individual &ndash; Jock Stein.<br><br>At Celtic, his word was law. When an  international was due and I was a cert to get a call-up, he would ask:  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to be bothered playing against that lot, do you?&rdquo;<br><br>It  was, of course, a rhetorical question. If Scotland were playing one of  the smaller nations, Jock preferred his players to rest before a vital  club game the next Saturday.<br><br>He would &lsquo;advise&rsquo;: &ldquo;Say you&rsquo;ve got a hamstring or something. I&rsquo;ll get someone from the club to put in a call.&rdquo;<br><br>However, if it was a crucial qualifying game in the World Cup or Euros it was different.<br><br>Back then, the international fee was &pound;50 so you cleared around &pound;36 after tax, etc.<br><br>Big  Jock would add a sweetener &ndash; a &pound;50 tax-free payment for not  representing Scotland. So you got more by not playing for your country  than you could for playing!<br><br>Money, of course, had nothing to do with it. You can&rsquo;t buy those sort of memories.<br><br>But  Jock could be very, very persuasive and he was always quick to tell  anyone: &ldquo;There are other players out there who are just as good as you  and who could do your job for Celtic.&rdquo;<br><br>It was a thinly-veiled  threat, of course. He couldn&rsquo;t actually force you to pull out, but you  wouldn&rsquo;t have to be Einstein to work out you might be putting your  first-team place in jeopardy if you went against his wishes.  <h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>DENIS LAW ON TOMMY GEMMELL		 		 		<a class="external" href="http://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/denis-law-on-tommy-gemmell/#comments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> 1</a> 		 	 	 	<div class="post-meta"> 		By  			<a class="external" href="http://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/author/cqn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Posts by CQN Magazine">CQN Magazine</a> 		 		  		on			 				2nd March 2017 			 	</div> 	  	 	 		 			 			 				 								 				<div>SCOTLAND legend Denis Law joined the footballing world in the tributes for Tommy Gemmell.</div>  <div>The iconic Lawman, who celebrated his 77th birthday on Saturday, said: &ldquo;I have lost a dear friend.</div>  <div>&ldquo;I switched on the television this morning to be confronted with the sad news and my heart sank.</div>  <div>&ldquo;Maybe Scotland didn&rsquo;t get through to World Cup Finals and suchlike in our day, but we had a damn good team.</div>  <div>&ldquo;And Tommy Gemmell was part of that, you better believe it.</div>  <div>&ldquo;He was a special big guy.

Obviously, he was much, much more than a mere team-mate.</div> <div>&ldquo;He was great company and I always thoroughly enjoyed our time  together, whether it was on a football field, sitting by a loch doing a  spot of fishing, taking in a movie, having a quiet drink in a bar, oh,  anywhere and everything.</div>  <div>&ldquo;His courage in his gallant battle against motor neurone disease  was humbling. I used to pop into his home in Uddingston to say a quick  hello almost on a daily basis.</div>  <div>&ldquo;His wife Agnes had rigged up a room that was custom-built for the Wee Man.</div>  <div>&ldquo;He had a big comfortable armchair and a massive TV screen that was normally tuned into one of the sports programmes.</div>  <div>&ldquo;I would go there to try to cheer up my little chum, but, more  often than not, it was he who had me in gales of laughter by the time I  got back to my car. &ldquo;I remember a day Bertie Auld and I arranged to visit him.

He played football not so-much with a smile on his face, more with a huge grin. He loved the game, he loved playing it and his attacking, cavalier style was an integral part of the Lisbon Lions legend.<br><br>His goal got Celtic back on terms with Inter Milan in that unforgettable night in Lisbon in May, 1967 when they won the European Cup.<br><br>Not content with one European Cup Final goal, he would score another, Celtic&#39;s counter in their losing final against Feyenoord in 1970.<br><br>Gemmell was not the first attacking full-back, but, he took the concept of the full-back as an auxiliary winger to new heights during his years with Celtic.<br><br>He was born in Motherwell and the Steelmen were his team as he grew up in Craigneuk. He tasted early success &ndash; in the classroom as Dux of Craigneuk Primary &ndash; and on the football field as Craigneuk won the local Primary league. At Wishaw High School, football began to surpass learning for Tommy and, aged 16, he left to become an apprentice electrician at Ravenscraig Steelworks.<br><br>He was also playing youth football with Meadow Thistle and, after impressing in a representative game at Fir Park, he was offered the chance to train two nights per week with the Celtic part-timers. He also signed for junior side Coltness United, before signing a provisional form with Celtic the following evening, 21 October, 1961, along with a certain Jimmy Johnstone.<br><br>Gemmell was still a part-time footballer, continuing his electrician&#39;s apprenticeship, when he made his first-team debut, against Aberdeen, at Pittodrie, on 5 January, 1963. This was the first of what would be 434 games for Celtic, in which he scored 69 goals, including 34 penalties.<br><br>The following season, he made the left-back spot his own, although, naturally right-footed, he could play on that side if required. That season was his last as a part-timer, Gemmell completed his electrician&#39;s apprenticeship and immediately signed full-time forms with Celtic.<br><br>The return of Jock Stein to Celtic totally changed the landscape of Scottish football. Gemmell and Stein had a sometimes prickly relationship off the park, but, on it, it worked and on 2 April, 1966, Gemmell won the first of an eventual 18 Scotland caps in the 4-3 loss to England, at Hampden.<br><br>The following season was unforgettable, as Celtic won every competition they entered, capping this with that immortal 2-1 win over Inter Milan in Lisbon. Gemmell&#39;s opener in the final was not the only landmark goal he scored in Europe that season, his strike against FC Zurich, back in September 1966, was Celtic&#39;s first European Cup goal. He was an ever-present for his club that season, and for Scotland, as he was one of the 11 Wembley Wizards who thrashed world champions England, on 15 April, 1967.<br><br>The following season he scored against Racing Club of Buenos Aires during the bad-tempered World Club Championship match, however, his behind the referee&#39;s back kick at one of the Argentinian thugs, caught by the tv cameras, is more often remembered.<br><br>This was one of two high-profile moments when Gemmell reacted strongly to unpunished violence against him. In a World Cup qualifier, against West Germany, in Hamburg in 1969, he memorably &ldquo;booted up the bahookie&rdquo;, Helmut Haller after the German had tapped his ankles and escaped censure from the referee.<br><br>The red card he received saw him dropped from the Celtic team to face St Johnstone in the League Cup final and this incident fatally weakened the always testy relationship between him and Stein. He was placed on the transfer list, but, it would be over two years, during which he scored his second European Cup Final goal, then, almost immediately the rift between player and club widened when Gemmell and Bertie were sent home for misbehaviour on an end of season tour to the USA.<br><br>Gemmell left Celtic, signing for Nottingham Forest in December, 1971, trebling his wages by doing so. He played at the City Ground for two seasons before going to the USA to play for Miami Toros, before returning to Scotland to play out his career with Dundee. Here, there was a final playing hurrah as, in December, 1973, he captained the &#39;Dee to a 1-0 League Cup final victory, over Celtic; laughing in the face of some disgraceful barracking from the Hoops fans who used to worship him.<br>Article continues after...<br><br>During the close season of 1977 he became manager at Dundee, succeeding Davie White. He brought Jimmy Johnstone to Dens Park, and helped develop the young Gordon Strachan, but, with the club heading for relegation in April 1980, he resigned. Apart from nearly two years as Albion Rovers manager between January, 1986 and November 1987, he was finished with football playing or management. Or so he thought: In April, 1993 he was persuaded to return to Albion Rovers, but, stayed for just nine months, before resigning again.<br><br>While at Dundee, Gemmell had taken his first steps in business, buying and running a hotel in Errol. He later ran another hotel, prior to entering the insurance and financial planning industry, where he did well with various companies, rising to managerial level. He also had a spell as a football reporter with Radio Clyde, where his trenchant views made him very popular with the listeners.<br><br>His first marriage, to Anne, collapsed during his time running the hotel in Errol and simultaneously managing Dundee. He divorced and remarried. His second wife Mary, survives him with David and Karen Michelle, the children of his first marriage.<br><br>Tommy Gemmell loved fast cars and a good time. He loved life. With Celtic he won 14 medals &ndash; one European Cup-winner&#39;s, six Scottish League-winner&#39;s, three Scottish Cup-winner&#39;s and four League Cup-winners, adding that fifth League Cup-winner&#39;s medal with Dundee. He was inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and named as left-back in The Greatest-Ever Celtic team.

However, the move was short-lived, and later that year he returned to Scotland to join Dundee where he spent the last four years of his playing career.<br><br>Gemmell also made 18 appearances for Scotland after making his debut against England in April 1966, and was part of the famous Scotland side that beat the World Cup winners the following year 3-2 at Wembley. His one and only international goal came via a penalty against Cyprus in a 1970 World Cup qualifier, and he would make his final appearance for his country in 1971, before retiring completely in 1977 to become Dundee&rsquo;s manager.<br>tommy-gemmell.jpg<br>Gemmell scored in the 1967 European Cup final as Celtic became Britain&#39;s first European champions (Getty)<br><br>Gemmell also managed Albion Rovers, having spent three years in the dug-out at Dundee, and after his first stint ended in 1987, he returned to the club six years later before leaving the following season.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s statement added: &ldquo;Tommy Gemmell is a true Celtic legend, part of the greatest side in the club&rsquo;s history and a man who played a pivotal role in our greatest ever triumph when, in Lisbon&rsquo;s Estadio Nacional, 11 men all born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park, beat Inter Milan to win the European Cup.<br><br>&ldquo;The whole Celtic Family is mourning his passing, and everyone associated with the club sends their thoughts and prayers to his family, his fellow Lions and his many friends at this desperately sad time.&rdquo;<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  </h3><h3>Tommy Gemmell, one of Celtic&#39;s Lisbon Lions dies at the age of 73</h3><br>Tommy Gemmell<br>Tommy Gemmell: 1943-2017<br>http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/03/02/tommy-gemmell-one-celtics-lisbon-lions-dies-age-73/<br> Roddy Forsyth <br><br>2 March 2017 &bull; 9:10am<br><br>Immortality contains its own taunting contradictions, as we have been reminded by the latest tidings of Celtic&rsquo;s 1967 European Cup winning team, the first British side to bring the ultimate club trophy back to these shores. As time burnishes the epic achievement of an assembly of players who &ndash; Bobby Lennox apart &ndash; were all born within a modest hike of Glasgow city centre, the passing years insist upon their toll of transient flesh.<br><br>The death of Tommy Gemmell, the left back whose equalising goal on that May evening restored Celtic&rsquo;s fortunes against a chronically defensive Inter Milan whose tactics were designed to suffocate the Scottish champions&rsquo; swashbuckling ambitions, means that there are now only seven Hoops survivors. Bobby Murdoch was the first to pass, aged 56, in 2001, followed by Ronnie Simpson in 2004 and Jimmy Johnstone two years later.<br><br>Gemmell had been ill for some time and news of his death came only four days after the family of Billy McNeill confirmed publicly that the Lisbon Lions&rsquo; captain has been severely affected by the ravages of dementia. That these bulletins have been issued in the approach to the 50th anniversary of the Lions&rsquo; feat will imbue the many planned celebrations with poignancy.<br><br>Gemmell was something of a rambunctious figure, in appearance as well as character. His prominent nose was the object of dressing room banter, which he tried to mitigate by suggesting that he was, in fact, a ringer for the American movie and musical star, Danny Kaye.<br><br>&ldquo;He loved to be called Danny because Danny Kaye was an entertainer and so was my pal,&rdquo; said former team-mate, Bertie Auld. &ldquo;He was a Lisbon Lion and he could entertain. I will miss everything about him.&rdquo;<br><br>Gemmell was not to be goaded with impunity and, if overmastered by his temper, the outcome could be spectacular, as when he was sent off during one of his 18 Scotland appearances, a World Cup qualifier in West Germany in 1969. The Scots needed to avoid defeat to have a chance of the play-offs but were trailing 3-2 in the closing stages when Helmut Haller, who had been niggling Gemmell, clipped the big man&rsquo;s heels.<br><br>Gemmell&rsquo;s response was to boot Haller right up the rear end, a majestic foul which threatened to launch the German into the stands. Without waiting for the formalities of dismissal, Gemmell made straight for the tunnel.<br><br>He was also known to test the patience of Jock Stein on occasions, one of which was the Scottish League Cup final at Hampden Park in October 1969. Gemmell had left the dressing room to dispense match tickets to family and friends. Stein, meanwhile, became annoyed at having been kept waiting and had dropped Gemmell from the team and replaced him with David Hay, who got a winners&rsquo; medal for the 1-0 victory over St Johnstone.<br><br>It was, however, for connivance in ignoring Stein&rsquo;s instructions in Lisbon that Gemmell was rewarded with his moment of epochal significance. Trailing 1-0 to Sandro Mazzola&rsquo;s early penalty kick, Celtic pushed Inter steadily back upon their own lines, but as the contest wore on without producing a change of fortune, both Hoops full backs found themselves high upfield.<br><br>&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t supposed to do that,&rdquo; said Jim Craig, who was at right back. &ldquo;It was risky and wouldn&rsquo;t have happened in just about any other circumstances but this was the European Cup final and we were desperate for a goal.<br><br>&ldquo;I had the ball just inside their penalty box and was holding it, trying to draw the nearest opponent. Big Tam was coming up behind, screaming for the pass. I played it back and he shot home the equaliser.<br><br>&ldquo;Afterwards he said, &lsquo;Did you hear me?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Your granny in Largs could have heard you.&rsquo; And that was what set us up and Steve Chalmers duly got the winner.&rdquo;<br><br>Gemmell&rsquo;s defensive solidity, combined with attacking flair, kept him in favour with Stein, who installed him at left back, although he was a right footed player. In 1970 Gemmell again scored in a European Cup final, but this time in a reversal of the circumstances of 1967, when Celtic met Feyenoord in Milan.<br><br>His goal was the opener but Celtic, having underestimated their Dutch opponents, lost 2-1 in extra time. Nevertheless, Gemmell, along with Phil Neal of Liverpool, was able to claim the joint distinction of being the only British footballers to score in two European Cup finals.<br><br>Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive, said: &quot;One of the privileges of my job is that you get to meet your heroes and Tommy was certainly one of them. I remember the goals in Lisbon and Milan.<br><br>&ldquo;That Lisbon team inspired me - the underdog, 11 local lads, a unique achievement for Celtic and Scotland. I also remember watching the Scotland game in Germany on the television when Helmut Haller went past Tommy and nicked him and he turned round and blootered** him.<br><br>&quot;He was larger than life and he was a leader as well. He was one of the best full-backs in the world in his time, if not the best.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  </h3><h3>Tommy Gemmell, Celtic hero and &lsquo;Lisbon Lion&rsquo;, has died after a long illness</h3>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/02/celtic-lisbon-lion-inter-milan-european-cup-winner-tommy-gemmell-died<br>&bull; Gemmell scored in famous 1967 European Cup win against Internazionale<br>&bull; Left-back also scored in 1970 final when Hoops were beaten by Feyenoord<br><br><br>Shares<br>621<br>Comments<br>155<br><br>Press Association<br><br>Thursday 2 March 2017 09.15 GMT<br>Last modified on Thursday 2 March 2017 14.09 GMT<br><br>Tommy Gemmell, a member of Celtic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lisbon Lions&rsquo; team who won the 1967 European Cup, has died at the age of 73 after a long illness.<br><br>Gemmell scored the equaliser in the final against Internazionale in the Portugal capital almost 50 years ago, with Stevie Chalmers scoring the winner after another Gemmell raid down the left flank.<br>From The Vault: The Lisbon Lions<br>Read more<br><br>Celtic said in a statement on Thursday morning: &ldquo;The whole Celtic family is mourning his passing, and everyone associated with the club sends their thoughts and prayers to his family, his fellow Lions and his many friends at this desperately sad time.&rdquo;<br><br>Gemmell, who was capped 18 times by Scotland and played in the 3-2 victory against the World Cup winners England at Wembley in 1967, also scored in the 1970 final when the Hoops were defeated by the Dutch side Feyenoord.

Celtic were the first British club to win the competition.<br><br><br>His death comes days after the family of Billy McNeill confirmed the Lisbon Lions captain has dementia, and shortly before the 50th anniversary of Celtic&rsquo;s greatest triumph. Their fans have paid tribute to their most famous team in the 67th minute of each game in recent months with a light display and song, In The Heat Of Lisbon.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s statement said: &ldquo;Tommy Gemmell is a true Celtic legend, part of the greatest side in the club&rsquo;s history and a man who played a pivotal role in our greatest ever triumph when, in Lisbon&rsquo;s Estadio Nacional, 11 men all born within a 30-mile radius of Celtic Park, beat Inter Milan to win the European Cup.<br><br>&ldquo;The legend of the Lisbon Lions was created that night, and Tommy and his team-mates were assured their place in the pantheon of Celtic greats. And, like the rest of the Lions, Tommy remained humble about his incredible football achievements.&rdquo;<br><br>Gemmell joined Nottingham Forest in 1971 and spent two years with the East Midlands club. He spent a short time in the US with the Miami Toros before moving on to Dundee, who he captained to victory against Celtic in the 1973 League Cup final after scoring the only goal in the Hampden semi-final win over Kilmarnock. He remains the last man to lift a major trophy for the club and retired in 1977.<br><br>He went on to manage Dundee for three years, the highlight being promotion back to the Premier League in 1978&ndash;79 as champions. He also had two spells in charge of Albion Rovers six years apart.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m devastated, absolutely heartbroken,&rdquo; said Bertie Auld, a fellow Lion. &ldquo;Tommy was one of my favourite people, a great colleague and a genuine pal.&rdquo;<br><br>Murdo MacLeod, a former Celtic midfielder who also spent a spell as assistant manager at Parkhead, described Gemmell as &ldquo;one of the greats&rdquo;. He told BBC Scotland: &ldquo;I know he had been struggling over the last few months. Just really sad news.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s obviously been one of the greats at Celtic Park to be part of the European Cup-winning side. A top player, one of the first defenders getting forward all the time. [It&rsquo;s] just so sad. We heard Billy McNeill&rsquo;s news over the last few days and now this.

In this particular year it is so very sad to lose such an important figure &ndash; while we mourn his loss, I am sure all our supporters will also celebrate the life and the wonderful achievements of the great Tommy Gemmell.&rdquo;<br><br>There were also tributes from his other clubs. &ldquo;Nottingham Forest were saddened to hear of the passing of former player Tommy Gemmell this morning,&rdquo; read a statement from the club for whom he made 39 league appearances and scored six goals from 1971&ndash;73. &ldquo;Everyone at Nottingham Forest sends their condolences to Tommy&rsquo;s family and friends at this sad time.&rdquo;<br><br>Albion Rovers said in a statement: &ldquo;Everyone at Albion Rovers FC, fans and staff would like to pass on our condolences to the Gemmell family after the sad passing of ex-Albion Rovers manager and Celtic legend Tommy Gemmell today.

And the two full-backs were outstanding in the European Cup final, with Jim Craig setting up Tommy to blast home Celtic&rsquo;s equaliser.<br><br>During his 10 years with the Hoops, Tommy won six league titles, three Scottish Cups, four League Cups and, of course, the European Cup.

Two months later, he joined Nottingham Forest where he spent two years, playing alongside future Celtic manager, Martin O&#39;Neill, and coach, John Robertson.<br><br>After a short and unsuccessful spell at Miami Toros, he then joined Dundee for three years, and ironically captained them to League Cup glory, beating Celtic 1-0 in the 1973 final.

Tommy Gemmell was such a footballer. One of the men who undoubtedly put the swash into the buckle of the Lisbon Lions, the loss of the 73-year-old yesterday following a long illness must have left his team-mate and friend Jim Craig feeling like the surviving member of a double-act. <br><br><a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/tommy-gemmell-the-celtic-full-back-who-took-role-to-the-future-1-4381762" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/tommy-gemmell-the-celtic-full-back-who-took-role-to-the-future-1-4381762</a></h3><div class="p402_premium">Gemmell marauding down the left flank from his full-back role and Craig doing likewise from that berth on the right made Celtic a British team like never before &ndash; who in 1967 cemented that status by becoming the first non-Latin winners of the European Cup.<div class="p402_hide"><div>Tommy Gemmell, Bertie Auld and Billy McNeill hoist the European Cup in 1967. Picture</div></div>Craig, who describes himself as &ldquo;the keeper&rdquo; of his Celtic room-mate &ndash; through being entrusted to keep ensuring a Gemmell &ldquo;not the best&rdquo; with punctuality made it on time to training sessions, team buses and meetings on trips &ndash; can recall how it was a Latin influence that allowed the two full-back to sashay forward with menace, on what became known as the overlap.<div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div><div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div>The gung-ho Gemmell with blunderbus shooting ability that frames memories of his playing legend simply did not exist until Jock Stein took over Celtic in 1965 &ndash; and masterminded a period that delivered the club into an inconceivable promised land after it had seemed destined to reside in a  permanent wilderness. <div class="p402_hide"><div class="taboola-right-rail__title"></div><div class="taboola"></div>   </div>&ldquo;I remember Tam telling me that one of the coaching staff that was there before Jock once said to him before a game that if he crossed the halfway line he would be out of the team the next week,&rdquo; said Craig, pictured below.&ldquo;Tam and I were the athletic types who would be centre-halves in those days, and so we were expected to play like them because we were just seen as other elements of the defence. That meant getting the ball and passing to someone else without automatically moving forward.&ldquo;But Jock changed all that. He told me that after he watched the 1960 European Cup final between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt at Hampden, he recognised that for a team to be successful using every component, all players within it bar the the centre-half &ndash; with Real that was Jose Santamaria &ndash; had to be able to contribute to attacking outcomes. The players were there at Celtic to do that, and with Tam it absolutely worked out like that because he was one of the best full-backs Celtic have ever had.&rdquo;The demands of a role that was defence-***-attack were considerable for Celtic&rsquo;s full-backs, but Stein had only one real demand of a twosome that were, effectively, auxiliary wingers and who created a template for those  berths that has been followed to this day. <div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div><div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div>&ldquo;It took its toll on us both eventually with Jock saying: I don&rsquo;t care how often we went forward &ndash; as long as you come back.&rdquo;That Gemmell went forward with menace is reflected in the fact that he scored 67 Celtic goals. An altogether fitting total for one of only two players &ndash; John Clark the other &ndash; who played in every single game of Celtic&rsquo;s all-conquering season. All the more so because his strike to draw Celtic level against Internazionale at the Estadio Nacional in the Portuguese capital will forever be his most famous scoring contribution, setting Stein&rsquo;s men on their way to a 2-1 triumph.Three years later, he scored in the European Cup final lost to Feyenoord that led to the memorable exchange often recalled by Martin O&rsquo;Neill when Gemmell moved to Nottingham Forest, where the Irishman was then coming through the ranks. &ldquo;Tell us about your European Cup final goal?&rdquo; the callow O&rsquo;Neill asked. &ldquo;Which one son?&rdquo; came Gemmell&rsquo;s reply.A typical response from an ebullient character within a Lions squad that could have been a gang show, such was the preponderance of sharp-witted showmen. Too many, indeed, for Gemmell to wear his European Cup final exploits as a badge of honour. <div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div><div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div>&ldquo;He took it all in his stride, he wasn&rsquo;t one to crow about his achievements, among us. He wouldn&rsquo;t dare because he would have been cut down to size pretty quick and reminded of his mistakes,&rdquo; said Craig.&ldquo;The great thing about Tam was that he had enormous confidence &ndash; which he showed in taking penalties with aplomb whatever the circumstances. And not for him any difficult hours just before any big European tie, when nerves would affect most of us as we clock-watched anxiously. In our room I would look round and he would have dropped off and be snoring his heid aff.&rdquo;Gemmell, one of whose 18 Scotland caps came as a  member of the side victorious at Wembley in 1967, didn&rsquo;t let ting sleeping dogs lie on certain moments in his career. In his autobiography Lionheart published in 2012 &ndash; one of three career accounts the Lanarkshire man had published &ndash; he went public on his bitterness with Stein over being dropped for the 1971 League Cup final against St Johnstone following his infamous booting of Helmut Haller up the backside  while playing for Scotland. Gemmell would have considered there was a certain poetic justice in the fact that he three years later captained Dundee to a League Cup triumph over Celtic. He later went on to manage Dundee before a spell in charge of Albion Rovers.In the same tome, Gemmell also reveals that, as a Protestant, he was the victim of sectarian abuse in his earlier years at Celtic from team-mates who favoured an all-Catholic side. Craig said: &ldquo;When you have 17 or 18 players you are not going to have a group where everyone is everyone else&rsquo;s best friend. That is impossible. But we had a camaraderie that none of us ever wanted to break.&rdquo; <div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div><div class="p402_hide"><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div></div>Gemmell was upset by his ties being broken with Celtic in December 1971, only two months after his League Cup final banishment. Yet, Celtic never really left him thanks to the enduring bond with the Lisbon Lions, and the enduring lustre of that side in Celtic club lore. Mortality has confronted that group, with the death of Gemmell following the pasing of Jimmy Johnstone, Bobby Murdoch, Ronnie Simpson and Stein, while Billy McNeill was revealed this weeek to be  suffering from Alzeheimers.&ldquo;There was a certain grace from God in Tam being taken from us because he suffered much in recent years,&rdquo; said Craig. &ldquo;I went to see him on Monday and Tuesday this week, and it was difficult, for him and his family. But he never complained.&rdquo; <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3></h3>BERTIE Auld says that his good friend and team-mate Tommy Gemmell was a truly world-class player and a wonderful, charismatic human being.<br><br> The Celtic great sadly passed away today at the age of 73, prompting a flood of tributes from across the football world.<br><br> And paying his own personal tribute, Bertie told Celtic TV that his fellow Lisbon Lion was a special player and a special man, who possessed enormous self-belief.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad day but yet all I think about is great memories,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;As far as I was concerned, he was the best left-back in the world at that particular time.

I will always remember those two goals and the two people that scored them.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  MARTIN O&rsquo;NEILL PAYS MOVING TRIBUTE TO GEMMELL</h3><br>By CQN Magazine on 3rd March 2017 Latest News<br><br>FORMER Celtic boss Martin O&rsquo;Neill has paid tribute to Lisbon Lion Tommy Gemmell who has died at the age of 73.<br><br>The Irishman was a team-mate of the Hoops legend at Nottingham Forest in the latter stages of the full-back&rsquo;s career.<br><br>Gemmell and O&rsquo;Neill met again when when he became manager of the Parkhead side in the summer of 2000.<br><br>But it is one of the early meetings with Gemmell that O&rsquo;Neill recalls with a smile.<br><br>He recalled: &ldquo;I was just a young player at Forest when Tommy came down to play after leaving Celtic and I was a little bit in awe of him and what he had achieved at Celtic.<br>&ldquo;I plucked up the courage one day to say to him &lsquo;that was some goal in the European Cup Final,&rsquo; to which he replied without a second of a pause, &lsquo;which one, son?&rsquo;<br><br>&ldquo;And I thought to myself, &lsquo;very good&rsquo;, well, brilliant actually, just brilliant.

I had signed for the  club in January 1965 and although I was still halfway through the fourth  year of the five-year course in dentistry &ndash; and should have been  attending medical classes at the Royal Infirmary most mornings &ndash; I  managed to &lsquo;dog-off&rsquo; sometimes to train with the full-timers at Celtic  Park. Two months later, Jock Stein arrived; and everything changed! Training was much more interesting than before, a lot of it was done  with a ball and there was a fair bit of competition in all the various  activities. Although I was another fullback and therefore a possible future  rival, Tam could not have been more helpful and it was not long before I  considered him to be a pal. When I made the first team later that year, he was even more  considerate. When my nerves might have been showing, he made me feel  much more comfortable as we waited to go down the tunnel for a match. Soon, whenever we went to Seamill for a few days or travelled abroad,  we were paired up together as room-mates. However, this could have its  problems. Tam had many good qualities but he also could have his little  idiosyncracies. It had been made quite clear to me by the Boss that he  expected me to keep an eye on Tam and make sure that he was &lsquo;there&rsquo; when  he was supposed to be &lsquo;there&rsquo;. I never thought much about this request &ndash;  or perhaps command would be a better word &ndash; until certain events  started to play a part in my life. On a foreign trip, for instance, we would leave our room at the same  time to come.down for breakfast. Ten minutes later, though, the Boss  would be asking me &ldquo;Cairney, where is he?&rdquo; and I was thinking that he  had left the room at the same time as me and come down in the same lift.  I even saw him in the foyer. But since then, I didn&rsquo;t know! Mr Stein would ask me the same question when we were all seated in  the bus ready to go to training. Neilly Mochan would do a head count,  find out we were one short, tell the Boss it was Tam and the Boss would  shout out my name and ask the inevitable question, &ldquo;where the hell is  he?&rdquo; Unfortunately, these questions from the man in charge, asked in a  decided tone of asperity, were ones that I could not answer with any  degree of accuracy. Over the years, Tam could be accused of being noisy, argumentative,  flamboyant &ndash; he had the flashy suits and the car with the &lsquo;Colonel  Bogey&rsquo; horn &ndash; and even arrogant at times, but he also delivered, his  scoring record an excellent one for a fullback and his ability to drive  home a penalty a great bonus. Probably his most famous goal was the equaliser in the European Cup  final in Lisbon, although with great modesty might I say that he  received such a perfect pass along the 18-yard line that his Granny  could probably have knocked that one in? The last few years of his life have been tough. That once powerful  frame began to weaken and Tam was eventually confined to his bed, a  situation such a strong athlete must have found really difficult to cope  with. Eventually, on 2nd March, he succumbed to his illness and passed  away in the early hours of the morning. Our thoughts at this time must with his wife Mary, children Karen and  David plus his extended family. In the years since Celtic Football Club  was founded in 1887, there have been many fine full-backs who have worn  the hoops with distinction but undoubtedly the name of Tommy Gemmell  would be right up there with the best of them.<br> May he now rest in peace.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">TODAY&rsquo;S TOMMY GEMMELL TRIBUTE<br> <br></font><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3"> http://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/todays-tommy-gemmell-tribute/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<br> By CQN Magazine</font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">on 10th March 2017</font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">LIONS &amp; LEGENDS <br></font><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br> TOMMY GEMMELL, Lisbon Lion was remembered today by the Celtic family.

And she has made me promise to trim it to under an hour.<br> <br> I&rsquo;ll do my best.<br> <br> Okay, where to start when you are talking about a genuine Celtic legend, a unique footballer and human being who made the beautiful game even more attractive by his awesome presence?<br> <br> Well-deserved tributes have been paid over the past eight days to a man who will be remembered for all time in Celtic folklore.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell touched the hearts of so many and he gave us all an avalanche of outstanding memories to treasure and cherish.<br> <br> Only a few weeks ago, at his bedside in the Glasgow care facility that had become home for almost three months, I asked him what it was like to make so many people smile.<br> <br> How did it feel knowing his goal in Lisbon would still be being replayed in one hundred years&rsquo; time? And one hundred years after that?<br> <br> &ldquo;Ach, I&rsquo;m happy if I made other people happy,&rdquo; he said without a trace of mock modesty. He added: &ldquo;Mind you, I enjoyed it, too.&rdquo;<br> <br> Life was never dull around Tommy Gemmell. He was a generous, big-hearted personality who was one of the most humble guys I ever had the honour to meet and call a friend.<br> <br> He was an ordinary bloke who did extraordinary things.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell is the only British player to score in two European Cup Finals AND a World Club Championship Final. That feat will never be equalled.<br> <br> I was still at school when I first clapped eyes on this remarkable character in 1963. I&rsquo;ve been a Celtic supporter as far back as I can remember and I used to attend all the games in the old Jungle at Celtic Park with my dad and two uncles.<br> <br> The first left-back I can remember at Celtic was a sturdy, no-nonsense fellow by the name of Jim Kennedy.<br> <br> He was a proper full-back with his shorts pulled up to his armpits, concrete-reinforced shinpads and boots that must have weighed about four stone each.<br> <br> It didn&rsquo;t matter that he was as mobile as Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster because he rarely ventured into the other team&rsquo;s half.<br> <br> He was a defender and he was there to defend. I recall his main strength was his ability to lob the opposing outside-right about 50 yards with devastating accuracy.<br> <br> In Jim Kennedy&rsquo;s own words: &ldquo;I was purely a defender and tended to get a nosebleed if I went over the halfway line.&rdquo;<br> <br> And then in came this young whippersnapper by the name of Tommy Gemmell. He was 19 years old at the time and didn&rsquo;t look like any full-back I had ever seen. No sign of bulky shinpads, no boots made in John Brown&rsquo;s shipyard.<br> <br> He was blond, tall, lithe and stylish.<br> <br> And he could run like an Olympic athlete. Bewilderingly, he would spend a fair percentage of the game in enemy territory and he possessed the kick like an angry mule as he routinely terrified opposing goalkeepers.<br> <br> He was a swashbuckling character who performed with a swagger.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell was here to stay.<br> <br> For me, it was adoration at first sight.<br> <br> Of course, what I &ndash; and thousands of other Celtic fans didn&rsquo;t realise at the time &ndash; was the fact Tommy was going against strict orders from Sean Fallon, who was Jimmy McGrory&rsquo;s assistant manager, who threatened to drop him if he continued to cross the halfway line.<br> <br> Tommy, being Tommy, chose to ignore those instructions.<br> <br> And we can all be eternally grateful for that. If he had listened to the assistant manager, Celtic Football Club might not have a certain celebration to look forward to on May 25.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell scored 63 goals for Celtic. Even including 31 penalty-kicks, that is a stupendous record for a full-back.<br> <br> We should make no mistake, Tommy revolutionised that position.<br> <br> And he took on that task on his own. Jock Stein, of course, became Celtic manager in March 1965 and, as we all recognised, he encouraged attacking football.<br> <br> That suited Tommy Gemmell, but it must be noted Big Jock told him his main role in the team was to defend and heaven help him if he was marked absent when crosses were allowed to come into the Celtic box.<br> <br> But there was just no way you could curb the adventurous spirit or the eye-catching antics of this amazing footballer.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell was a cavalier in green and white hoops as he relentlessly hurtled up and down the right and left wings.<br> <br> Soon opponents were putting out wingers to man-mark the Celtic full-back. Incredible.<br> <br> So, we know all about the goals, the gongs and the glory of Tommy Gemmell&rsquo;s remarkable career at club and country level.<br> <br> What about the man?<br> <br> I could never have dreamed how things would pan out for Tommy Gemmell and that wee boy in the Jungle. Truly, as they say, you couldn&rsquo;t make it up. Fact is often stranger than fiction.<br> <br> I first interviewed Tommy in 1969 for a football magazine when I was 17 and working as a sports sub-editor on the Daily Record newspaper.<br> <br> To me, and many others, he wasn&rsquo;t just the best left-back at Celtic or in Scotland, he was the best left-back in the world.<br> <br> If Tommy had been born in Rio de Janiero and not Craigneuk, he would have been a global sensation.<br> <br> I recall that interview vividly. I was a nervous wreck when I dialled his phone number. &ldquo;Hello,&rsquo; said the voice at the other end.<br> <br> &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; I responded. I managed to blurt out: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Mr Gemmell.&rdquo;<br> <br> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found him,&rdquo; came the friendly reply. &ldquo;And my name&rsquo;s Tommy. What can I do for you?&rdquo;<br> <br> I explained who I was and that I was looking for an interview for a football magazine. I asked: &ldquo;May I steal five minutes of your time?&rdquo;<br> <br> There was a laugh at the other end of the line. &ldquo;No, you may not steal five minutes of my time. Take as long as you want, son.&rdquo;<br> <br> That conversation lasted 48 years, on and off.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell transformed from hero to friend in a heartbeat that day.<br> <br> He put a rookie interviewer at ease and I never forgot that simple act of kindness.<br> <br> He was always there when I needed him, nothing was too much bother for this guy. Eventually, we met in person and we kept the friendship going.<br> <br> This generous man &ndash; and I use the word &lsquo;generous&rsquo; in all its many aspects &ndash; gave up his time to spend hours being interviewed by me and the sports reporters of various other newspapers and magazines.<br> <br> We all knew he was an intelligent, witty character and the stories just about wrote themselves. Tommy Gemmell never asked for a penny for his time.<br> <br> There were other individuals in the sport without a scintilla of Tommy Gemmell&rsquo;s ability who&rsquo;s first question would be if you asked them for an interview was &ldquo;How much?&rdquo;<br> <br> There was a well-known character who was known to the Press as FIFA.<br> <br> And &lsquo;m not talking about world football&rsquo;s governing body.<br> <br> You spoke to this guy and it was a case of &ldquo;a fee for this&rdquo; and &ldquo;a fee for that.&rdquo;<br> <br> That was not Tommy Gemmell&rsquo;s style.<br> <br> As a human being, Tommy insisted there were two classes: First and none. Guess which category fitted Tommy.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell, of course, played his football as he lived his life, with a smile on his face. And he lived life to the full, believe me.<br> <br> I left the Sunday Mail, where I had been sports editor, in 1994 and acquired a sports news agency called 7 Day Press. I moved the company to West Nile Street in Glasgow city centre.<br> <br> Around the same time, the financial advisers where Tommy worked shifted across the city to&hellip;West Nile Street. Suddenly, my big pal and I were neighbours.<br> <br> The Iron Horse pub was directly opposite my office and a short free-kick from Tommy&rsquo;s. Needless to say, it became headquarters. Two or three times a week, I would receive a phone call from Tommy: &ldquo;HQ, five minutes.&rdquo;<br> <br> Who could turn down that request?<br> <br> This went on for for the best part of 20 years. Just an hour or so in each other&rsquo;s company, a lot of the time on our own &ndash; well, as much as you can be on your own in a pub in the heart of Glasgow.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell was, of course, still an instantly recognisable figure.<br> <br> I want to meet the genius who invented mobile camera phones.<br> <br> I&rsquo;ve taken more snaps that David Bailey and Lord Lichfield combined.<br> <br> Complete strangers would burst into our company, it didn&rsquo;t matter that we were having a private conversation, and embrace Tommy like a long lost brother.<br> <br> And Tommy always had time for those fans. They would hand me their phone and order me to take a picture.<br> <br> Tommy would pose with his new best friend and have a natter before another satisfied punter left, looking at his phone and a memento that would no doubt be kept forever.<br> <br> Again, that was so typical of the man. He loved Celtic Football Club, but, equally, he loved Celtic fans.<br> <br> Eleven months ago &ndash; on April 8, to be precise &ndash; Tommy made his last appearance at a supporters&rsquo; function.<br> <br> Ironically, it was the Dunblane Tommy Gemmell Celtic Supporters&rsquo; Club and they were celebrating their 20th anniversary at Stirling Rugby Club.<br> <br> In truth, he wasn&rsquo;t in the greatest of health. He could quite easily have politely declined the invitation. However, he made up his mind he was going to make an effort and go to the function.<br> <br> &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to let anyone down,&rdquo; he said. My wife Gerda and I drove to Dunblane to pick him up that Friday night. He didn&rsquo;t look well at all, but he was absolutely determined he would attend the function. There was no changing his mind.<br> <br> Tommy saw out most of the evening before we drove him home again. We took him to his ground floor flat. Normally, he would ask us in for what he termed a snifter.<br> <br> But, on this evening, he turned and said: &ldquo;Do you mind if I go straight to bed? I&rsquo;m a wee bit tired.&rdquo;<br> <br> He looked shattered, out on his feet, but there was no way Tommy Gemmell was going to let down the people he always insisted were the greatest fans in the world.<br> <br> On our days in the Iron Horse pub, Tommy&rsquo;s tipple was dry white wine, but he always finished with a brandy and port.<br> <br> Somewhere along the line we would have blotting paper &ndash; Tommy&rsquo;s euphemism for food &ndash; but when we were winding down to go back to our respective workplaces, he would order up a brandy and port &ndash; &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s measure, please&rdquo;.<br> <br> For the uninitiated in the ways of pub culture, a &ldquo;Gentleman&rsquo;s measure&rdquo; is a double.<br> <br> However, I have this feeling if Tommy had still been around in May he might have fancied a treble.<br> <br> Even heroes have heroes and Tommy&rsquo;s favourite sportsman of all-time was Muhammad Ali, for many people, rightly proclaimed as &lsquo;The Greatest&rsquo;.<br> <br> Muhammad Ali was the world heavyweight boxing champion by the time he visited Scotland in August 1965.<br> <br> It was arranged for Ali to visit Celtic Park and then Ibrox and, of course, the press was out in force. Ali posed for all sorts of pictures, even hammed it up in a kilt and Tommy was like a kid when I talked to him years later about his meeting with his hero.<br> <br> Tommy told me: &ldquo;He was an awesome presence. You saw him on the telly, but you never really appreciated the size of the guy or his fabulous physique. The dimensions of his hands were like sides of ham. And, of course, he was such an immaculately-honed sportsman with incredible good looks.<br> <br> &ldquo;Apart from that, he was just an ordinary fella.&rdquo;<br> <br> As Ali prepared to leave Celtic Park to go and meet the Rangers players, Tommy told him to look out for Willie Henderson, the club&rsquo;s fabulous wee outside-right who also became a lifelong friend of Tommy.<br> <br> Willie Henderson is a boxing aficionado. Tommy, in fact, made the point Willie actually looked like a boxer on account of his squashed nose.<br> <br> Anyway, Muhammad Ali and his entourage arrived in Govan and went through the same routines with the Rangers players, posing for photographs and so on.<br> <br> Willie, as expected, took the opportunity to introduce himself to the world&rsquo;s greatest-ever fighter. They shook hands and Ali looked at Willie&rsquo;s nose.<br> <br> &ldquo;You a footballer?&rdquo; he asked.<br> <br> &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; answered Willie.<br> <br> Ali took another glance at the Rangers player&rsquo;s flattened hooter.<br> <br> &ldquo;Man, I&rsquo;m sure glad I&rsquo;m a boxer,&rdquo; he said.<br> <br> Of course, Muhammad Ali passed away in June last year at the age of 74, a year older than Tommy. Can you imagine the chat these two guys could be having today as they discuss their sporting achievements?<br> <br> The affection in which Tommy Gemmell held Willie Henderson is obvious today. Willie, who doesn&rsquo;t drive, made frequent visits to his big pal in Dunblane and, latterly, Glasgow.<br> <br> I love the story Tommy told me about Willie turning on a Rangers team-mate when they were at a footballing function.<br> <br> He was chatting to Tommy when an Ibrox colleague said: &ldquo;What are you talking to him for? He does nothing but kick you when you&rsquo;re out on the football park.&rdquo;<br> <br> Willie bristled. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never kicked me in his life. Tripped me up, tugged my jersey and pulled me down.<br> <br> &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s never kicked me!&rdquo;<br> <br> Speaking of wonderful wee touchline magicians, we couldn&rsquo;t possibly miss a mention of Jimmy Johnstone.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell loved his fellow-Lisbon Lions and what they achieved for Celtic, in particular, and the world of football, in general.<br> <br> He could spend hours extolling the virtues of Ronnie Simpson, Jim Craig, Bobby Murdoch, Billy McNeill, John Clark, Willie Wallace, Stevie Chalmers, Bertie Auld and Bobby Lennox.<br> <br> It must be said he was also a big fan of Davie Hay.<br> <br> But there is no doubt that wee Jinky Johnstone had a special place in the heart of Tommy Gemmell. They were football&rsquo;s odd couple with Tommy standing at 6ft 2in and Jinky at just 5ft 4in.<br> <br> They first met even before they joined Celtic as they both attended Burnbank Technical College in Lanarkshire.<br> <br> Tommy had thoughts of becoming an electrician and Jinky was training to become a welder. Thankfully, their career paths took a dramatically different course.<br> <br> Tommy and Jinky both signed for Celtic in the winter of 1961 and became the best of buddies throughout their lives.<br> <br> Tommy had a host of tales about Jinky, who, of course, was voted the Greatest-Ever Celtic Player by the supporters.<br> <br> We all knew what he got up to on the field, but his off-the-field antics were just as entertaining.<br> <br> Tommy told me the story of Jinky turning up at Celtic Park one day with a brand new Jaguar car. The wee man was as proud as Punch.<br> <br> &ldquo;Tam, come and have a smell at these seats. They&rsquo;re real leather &ndash; that&rsquo;s no&rsquo; rubber. Classy wheels, eh? A cigar lighter, too.&rdquo; And so on.<br> <br> Tommy agreed to let Jinky pick him after training the following day and they would head up to Crief for a relaxing spot of fishing.<br> <br> They were heading to one of Tommy&rsquo;s favourite spots and he was giving his wee mate directions.<br> <br> At one point, they came to a roundabout.<br> <br> &ldquo;Which way, Tam?&rdquo; asked Jinky.<br> <br> &ldquo;Straight through, Wee Man,&rdquo; answered Tommy.<br> <br> And with that, Jinky drove up onto the roundabout, through flower beds and all sorts of plants and down the other side.<br> <br> &ldquo;What the hell was that?&rdquo; screamed Tommy.<br> <br> &ldquo;Well, you said straight through,&rdquo; answered Jinky.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell will always be remembered as the guy who sent West German midfielder Helmut Haller into orbit when Scotland were playing in a World Cup qualifier in Hamburg in 1969.<br> <br> The Scots were losing 3-2 in a crucial game that would go a long way to determining their hopes of playing in Mexico the following year.<br> <br> With a minute to go, Tommy was charging through into his favourite position about 25 yards out and lining up a shot with his mighty right boot.<br> <br> Haller snaked out a foot and blatantly tripped Tommy.<br> <br> Tommy went down in a heap and was furious when the Swiss referee didn&rsquo;t award the expected free-kick. His mood didn&rsquo;t get any better when he saw Haller laughing.<br> <br> The red mist came down and Tommy chased after the West German and attempted to put him over the stand.<br> <br> Helmut Haller died in October 2012. I telephoned Tommy to get his reaction. Quick as a flash, he said: &ldquo;I hope they&rsquo;re not going to blame me.&rdquo;<br> <br> I won&rsquo;t dwell on Tommy Gemmell&rsquo;s latter years. My wife and I travelled through to Dunblane to go for lunch once a week for almost six years. It was always a pleasure to spend time in this bloke&rsquo;s company.<br> <br> We spoke on the phone virtually every day.<br> <br> Of course, the chat always got around to Celtic. Tommy wasn&rsquo;t able to get to as many games at Celtic Park as he would have liked, but he still retained a special interest in the club.<br> <br> He would see the action on TV and read the reports. He always paid particular attention to the left-backs over the years. He rated the players who went that extra mile and realised that attack was the best form of defence.<br> <br> Tommy liked Andy Lynch, who, of course, had started his career as an outside-left with Hearts.<br> <br> He enjoyed the exciting forays of Emilio Izaguirre and I can tell you he had the highest regard for Kieran Tierney.<br> <br> Genuinely, he spoke in glowing terms about the young man and I suppose if anyone could spot a left-back it would be Tommy Gemmell.<br> <br> In the past six months or so, Tommy&rsquo;s health was faltering. He was becoming increasingly frail, but I never once heard him moan about the situation.<br> <br> One of his favourite sayings was: &ldquo;Why should a living man ever complain?&rdquo;<br> <br> I didn&rsquo;t think there was anything left for Tommy Gemmell to do to prove he was such an inspiration.<br> <br> I was in awe of the courage, strength and character of the man.<br> <br> One of his favourite actors was John Wayne.<br> <br> Even Hollywood at its most far-fetched could never have captured the spirit and fortitude of Tommy Gemmell as he spent virtually the last three months of his incredible life bed-bound.<br> <br> On December 7 last year, Tommy moved from Dunblane to the 3 Bridges care facility in the south side of Glasgow, ironically not far from Hampden Park.<br> <br> He had fought and overcome so many obstacles as a footballer and a man, but this was one fight even the great Tommy Gemmell could not win.<br> <br> Last Thursday morning around 1.30, Tommy passed away. His wife Mary, who had been at his bedside for practically an entire week, phoned me a few minutes later.<br> <br> &ldquo;Tommy&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she said. Those were the words we dreaded, but realised were inevitable.<br> <br> You may believe you are well prepared for the news, but the words still hit you with the force of a wrecking ball.<br> <br> At that moment, the world lost a good man, Celtic lost a favourite son, football lost a legend and my wife Gerda and I lost an exceptional friend.<br> <br> More importantly, Mary lost a wonderful husband she called &ldquo;the love of my life&rdquo;.<br> <br> Tommy Gemmell, after a decade of unparalleled success at Parkhead, was transferred to Nottingham Forest in December 1971. He was 28. And, of course, he didn&rsquo;t want to leave Celtic.<br> <br> It was only a matter of time before he returned to Paradise. And he managed that this morning.<br> <br> Rest In Peace, old chum.<br> <br> Alex Gordon</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br><br> </h3></font><h3><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font><br></h3></div></div>
