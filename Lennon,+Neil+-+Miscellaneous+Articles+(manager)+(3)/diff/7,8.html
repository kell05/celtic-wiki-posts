Historic  strides. Strides that took him all the way to Moscow and back again with  three points in his pocket and a burgeoning reputation as a young  football manager of substance. <br><br>Unbeaten in six European ties  this season. Not just surviving, but thriving in the elite competition.  An away win in the Champions League at last, hewn not from a frenzied  &ldquo;mad dog in a meat house&rdquo; defiance but clever strategy and smart  execution by a team of his own making that has now won four points from a  possible six in a group they were generally expected to finish bottom  of.<br><br>They might yet fall away, but they have earned the right to  dream of the second phase. Even a single point in back-to-back ties with  Barcelona will keep that hope alive. Even without a point from those  two games they would remain alive. These are heady days indeed for  Lennon and his team.<br><br>Consider what has happened in Lennon&rsquo;s story  in just a year. October 2011 was his worst month in management, a month  that saw his team lose 2-0 at Hearts, lose three goals in one half  against Kilmarnock before rounding things off with an utterly lifeless  0-0 draw at home to Hibs, a result that saw the team booed off and then  filleted by Lennon in the aftermath. In terms of thermonuclear rants,  the one after that insipid draw at Celtic Park was right up there with  his gold-standard eruption after the loss to Ross County in the  semi-final of the Scottish Cup the season before. It was  Lennon on the  edge. At that point, he looked a seriously troubled manager.<br><br>And  now? We are witnessing a different animal. The Lennon of a year ago was  given to emotional outbursts against officials at the veritable dropping  of a hat. That doesn&rsquo;t happen much anymore, if at all. He had a chance  to have a blast a few weeks ago when Kris Commons was denied a  legitimate penalty in Perth but he chose not to take it. It looked like  an instructive moment. Celtic had lost the game and had suffered an  injustice, but he made nothing of it. It was an example of how he has  matured, how he now doesn&rsquo;t let himself get side-tracked by fighting  unwinnable wars against officials. <br><br>We&rsquo;re not saying he won&rsquo;t  rail against a referee making a bad decision in the future &ndash; he will;  they all do &ndash; but there was a time when Lennon seemed to rail against  every bad decision and it got him precisely nowhere. In fact, it was  counter-productive. <br><br>The theory here is that the person who was  being damaged more than any other by some of Lennon&rsquo;s emotional  overloads of the past was Lennon himself. He has looked more focused in  recent times than he ever has done as a manager. There&rsquo;s an argument to  be made that the demise of Rangers has helped this process in a very  considerable way. Instead of missing the heat of battle with his old  foe, Lennon seems to have been liberated by the end &ndash; for now &ndash; of that  kind of intensity, so much of it negative and exhausting and poisonous.<br><br>Nutting  heads with Rangers might have felt like the be-all and end-all of his  managerial life at the time but a new world has opened up to him since  he got his team into the Champions League and it&rsquo;s a world where he&rsquo;s  being asked to plot a result against some seriously hot teams, none  hotter than the Barcelona of Messi and Xavi and Iniesta. This time  twelve months ago, all Lennon could see on the road up ahead was an away  match against Kilmarnock, the infamous 3-3 draw. Instead of getting  sucked into the vortex of Old Firm bull****, he has this continental  dimension to his professional life now and it suits him. You wouldn&rsquo;t  think it by looking at their banners about zombies and hearing their  songs about Sevco, but Celtic really have left Rangers behind in their  rear-view mirror thanks to their qualification for the Champions League.  <br><br>Lennon is no longer a slugger whose management was defined by  how he did in the bearpit against Rangers. He has moved on from that.  There&rsquo;s a lot to admire about his new direction.<br><br><a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spl/tom-english-neil-lennon-flourishing-away-from-the-old-firm-bearpit-1-2561900" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spl/tom-english-neil-lennon-flourishing-away-from-the-old-firm-bearpit-1-2561900</a><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Neil Lennon interview in The Times with English based journo Oliver Kay.</h3>22 Oct 2012<br>The Times<br><br>Looking  back, Neil Lennon admits to having wondered &ldquo;where it was all going to  end&rdquo;. He shakes his head as he recalls the death threats, the bullets in  the post, being assaulted in the street (twice), the need for  round-the-clock protection, the court case, the loss of a close friend  and the concern that, as the Old Firm rivalry grew more and more toxic,  he might have to turn his back on the job he cherished.<br><br>Back  then, it seemed unimaginable that there could be a sense of calm in the  goldfish bowl that Lennon inhabits as the manager of Celtic. Where was  it all going to end? Not, he suspected, with a situation where Rangers  disappeared from Celtic&rsquo;s horizon, which this week is dominated instead  by Barcelona.<br><br>Tomorrow&rsquo;s Champions League encounter with  Barcelona at the Nou Camp is a challenge that excites the 41-year-old  more than any he has faced in his young managerial career. He talks with  enthusiasm, rather than apprehension, about the way Xavi Hern&aacute;ndez,  Andr&eacute;s Iniesta, Lionel Messi and their team-mates &ldquo;mesmerise you with  their possession and their movement&rdquo; and says it will take a perfect  combination of bravery, concentration and athleticism to stop them. &ldquo;But  you know what?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t normally look forward to games. This  one I&rsquo;ve really been looking forward to.&rdquo;<br><br>There have been times  in Lennon&rsquo;s life when he has barely been able to contemplate the next  match, let alone look forward to it. There were the well-documented  bouts of depression during his playing career. And there was that  period, from the discovery of explosive devices in parcels addressed to  him at Celtic&rsquo;s training ground early last year to the court case that  concluded last March, when it seemed as though Scottish football was  going into meltdown, with him at its core.<br><br>&ldquo;It was very  distressing, very traumatic,&rdquo; Lennon says. &ldquo;I was very well briefed and  very well looked after by the police. There was a spell when we were  having 24-hour protection. I was spending more time with the police than  with my players. I found it bewildering. I had been assaulted in the  street before and now all of this. I&rsquo;m just a football manager. I didn&rsquo;t  ask for any of that.&rdquo;<br><br>There were those who argued the  opposite, accusing him of whipping up the Old Firm hatred and bringing  the aggravation upon himself as a Northern Irish Catholic who lived up  to the modern Celtic ideal of their manager as a feisty figurehead.  &ldquo;That seems to be the party line for a lot of people who wanted to  excuse what went on,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There were times when I crossed the  line. I did make some mistakes, but it was no different to a lot of  other managers on the touchline . You can&rsquo;t excuse what went on. I think  people recognise that now. People realised it had gone too far.<br><br>&ldquo;From  a human point of view, the most difficult time was when the case was in  court. There had been myself and two other people who had been  pinpointed. One of them was Trish Godman [the Celtic-supporting former  MSP] and the other was a high-profile barrister, Paul McBride, who was a  good friend of mine. Paul had been very, very upset by what happened.  Then he went on a business trip to Pakistan and, sadly, while he was  there he got ill and he passed away. That was devastating. He was a  brilliant, intelligent, ebullient guy. I never got to say goodbye to  him.<br><br>&ldquo;I ended up going to Paul&rsquo;s funeral and then going straight  from there into court to give evidence. A few days later we had the  Scottish League Cup final against Kilmarnock, which we lost. And then to  cap it all, Liam Kelly, one of the Kilmarnock players, his father died  in the crowd straight after the final whistle, which was so sad.  Everything that was happening was extremely traumatic. It was just one  of those periods in your life where you wondered where it was all going  to end.<br><br>&ldquo;There were times when I thought about leaving the job.  It was difficult enough without all of this. But I&rsquo;ve worked really hard  all my life. A job like this is a privilege. I didn&rsquo;t want to give it  up for non-football reasons. I had already lost my international career  for non-football reasons. I found that once I came to the training  ground and we closed the gates, I could focus on and enjoy the job. It&rsquo;s  a great job.&rdquo;<br><br>That job feels different this season - more  relaxed, in some ways for better, in some ways for worse. The dynamics  of Scottish football - and in particular Glasgow football - have changed  dramatically with Rangers&rsquo; liquidation and relegation to the Irn-Bru  third division. As someone whose life was made almost intolerable by the  worst excesses of the Old Firm rivalry, Lennon has more reason than  most to welcome Rangers&rsquo; exile, but he does not see it that way. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  get me wrong, it makes my life easier,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s definitely an  edge that&rsquo;s not there in the same way now. That edge can be venomous and  the games can be fraught. With Rangers not around, the stress levels  have diminished a little bit. But for the whole of Scottish football -  for the glamour, the energy, the exposure - it would be better if it  hadn&rsquo;t happened.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve watched a few of Rangers&rsquo; games and it has  reminded me of when I left Celtic and went to Nottingham Forest. At  that time I found it difficult to adjust to a different environment and  to playing at a lower level . I think in time Rangers will get to a  level of consistency, but I can understand why they&rsquo;ve found it harder  than people might have expected.<br><br>&ldquo;For us, it has felt a bit surreal. I  think it took a bit of time at the start of the season for us to adjust  to the fact that Rangers aren&rsquo;t here. We&rsquo;ve lost a lot of money from  Rangers not being here, which made it even more imperative that we got  into the Champions League. That has been a great distraction and  something we&rsquo;ve really enjoyed.&rdquo;<br><br>The European campaign has been a  slow-burner, but, having got through the qualifying rounds by beating  both HJK Helsinki and Helsingborg, they started the group stage with a  0-0 draw at home to Benfica and then a thrilling 3-2 victory away to  Spartak Moscow, which has been hailed as one of the most astute  performances by a British team in the Champions League in recent years.  Suddenly, perhaps for the first time in his managerial career, people  are focusing on the sharp mind behind Lennon&rsquo;s pugnacious exterior.<br><br>&ldquo;The  performance in Moscow was probably even beyond my expectations,&rdquo; he  says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of young players and they played very well that  night. Tactically, and in terms of the bravery and spirit they showed,  they were excellent and that has given us a platform to go to Barcelona.  I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve got the mentality or the players just to sit in and  defend, like Chelsea did against Barcelona. We have to try to create  chances, like we did in Moscow. It won&rsquo;t be easy - it&rsquo;s the ultimate  challenge for the players and for me, too - but we&rsquo;re going to enjoy  it.&rdquo;<br><br>So, what kind of manager is Lennon? &ldquo;Good question,&rdquo; he  says. &ldquo;I like my team to play football, but we can&rsquo;t all aspire to be  Barcelona. You can have a template, but you have to be pragmatic, too. I  would describe myself as very pro-player. I&rsquo;m not long out of the game;  I understand how players are feeling and when confidence is low. I feel  like I can help use my own experiences to help them.&rdquo;<br><br>With  Lennon, that goes far beyond the culture of &ldquo;show us your medals&rdquo; (and  there are a lot of them). Perhaps the most valuable lessons he has  passed on at Celtic concerned sharing his experience with depression. &ldquo;I  first suffered it when I was 29,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I had everything I could  ever want. I had just won the League Cup with Leicester City, money  wasn&rsquo;t an issue, I was very happy and all of a sudden one day I hit this  brick wall.<br><br>&ldquo;It took me a long time to work out what it was. I  got help. It&rsquo;s not a good place to be. I would get it sporadically over a  two, three, four-week period. I feel like I am in control of it now.  I&rsquo;ve not had a bout for a few years. But it&rsquo;s an illness, not a state of  mind. The more that people are willing to talk about it, the more it  will help people. A couple of our young players have suffered with it  and I&rsquo;ve been able to talk to them about it. I actually think it has  helped me rather than hindered me a manager.&rdquo;<br><br>Certainly,  management - and specifically managing such a giant club as Celtic,  where the job is all-consuming - has occupied his mind. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very  fulfilling and it&rsquo;s a constant challenge of your thought processes,&rdquo; he  says. &ldquo;Sometimes when players hang up their boots, they worry that  there&rsquo;s a void in their life. For me, there could no better way of  filling that void than managing Celtic.&rdquo;<br><br>As for that other void,  he expects Rangers to come back sooner rather than later. In a strange  kind of way, he misses them. But not this week. Not when he has  Barcelona on his mind.<br><br>Lennon backs Hooper&rsquo;s England credentials<br><br>It  was an endorsement of Neil Lennon&rsquo;s judgment and of Celtic&rsquo;s  recruitment strategy, as well as the player concerned, when Fraser  Forster was included in the England squad for the first time last week.  Lennon expects Gary Hooper to follow Forster in forcing his way into Roy  Hodgson&rsquo;s plans and has backed him to underline his credentials against  Barcelona tomorrow evening.<br>&ldquo;Fraser deserved his selection, because  he&rsquo;s been an outstanding goalkeeper for us, and that has given Gary a  real motivation to believe that he can be called up by England, too,&rdquo;  Lennon, the Celtic manager, said.<br><br>&ldquo;I think Gary is good enough, certainly. He&rsquo;s a brilliant goalscorer, a consistent goalscorer.<br><br>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t be fazed by playing against Barcelona. He has done it at all  levels and in all types of game &mdash; big games against Rangers, Europa  League, Champions League, you name it. He has a great intelligence and  appreciation as a footballer. People ask if he would still be scoring  goals if he was playing in England. I&rsquo;ve no doubt he would, just as I  had no doubt he would score goals here when he came from Scunthorpe.  He&rsquo;s a quality player, like [Nikica] Jelavic, who went from Rangers to  Everton.&rdquo;<br><br>Hooper, 24, has been linked with a move to Liverpool in  the January transfer window, but Lennon has no intention of selling.  &ldquo;There were bids from Southampton last January, but we&rsquo;re looking to  keep players like Gary,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a lot of excellent young  players, so there&rsquo;s a lot of speculation surrounding them, but we want  to build this team. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>Neil Lennon enjoys peace in history after outwitting Barcelona<br></h3>Celtic&#39;s victory over Champions League favourites is just reward for a club who backed their young manager during dark times<br>Kevin McKenna The Observer<br><br>http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/nov/10/neil-lennon-history-celtic-barcelona<br>11 Nov 2012<br><br>For a man whose name alone in Scotland is enough to inflame passion, be  it furious or joyous, Neil Lennon chooses serenity when the heat of  battle has subsided. This is how it was around 10pm last Wednesday, in  Glasgow, when the assembled Scottish and Spanish media corps pressed in  on him, eager to hear his thoughts on what had just unfolded before them  all. Lennon&#39;s Celtic team, with an average age of 24 and a collective  price tag of &pound;6.5m, had inflicted defeat on Barcelona, the best team in  the world and assembled at a cost of &pound;125m. The Catalans&#39; squad is  studded with World Cup and Champions League winners, yet they were  undone on the night by a Lanarkshire 18 year old who had been playing  for Airdrie against teams such as East Fife and Stenhousemuir barely two  years previously, before Celtic paid &pound;50,000 for him.<br><br>Lennon was  entitled to be ecstatic, triumphant even, at having steered his young  charges to arguably the greatest victory witnessed at Celtic Park.  Instead, the journalists encountered a reflective man, proportionate in  his admiration for the way his team had played and measured in his  thoughts about what the future may hold for them.<br><br>&quot;My players are  all heroes to me and I can&#39;t speak too highly of their performance,&quot; he  said. &quot;You can talk about tactics until you are blue in the face, but  football is about the players. They covered themselves in glory tonight.  We can give instructions to them, but it&#39;s down to the players to go  and do it.&quot;<br><br>Lennon is entitled to some peace and tranquillity  after 12 years of sheer tumult and brimstone. In 2002 the garlanded  Ayrshire-born classical music composer, James MacMillan, penned a solo  piano piece in tribute to him, called For Neil. The musician&#39;s  dedication hints at the tempest that has swirled around Lennon. &quot;I felt  moved to write this little gift piece for him because of the pressures  that have been put upon him, as a Celtic player, from Northern Ireland,  and to remind him that he is greatly revered by many, in spite of the  sectarian abuse he receives from other quarters. It is reflective and  intimate, with the lilt and accent of an Irish folk song.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The  pressures that have been put upon him&quot; began almost as soon as Lennon  joined Celtic from Leicester City in 2000. From the outset, his debut at  Dens Park in Dundee, he was routinely singled out for abuse at almost  every ground he visited with Celtic, and most especially at Ibrox and  Tynecastle, the homes of Rangers and Hearts. Part of this was due to his  belligerence as Celtic&#39;s midfield enforcer in the team that Martin  O&#39;Neill, his old Filbert Street mentor, guided to the Uefa Cup final  three years later. But for many, the sight and sound of a stocky,  mouthy, red-haired Catholic Ulsterman playing for Celtic was simply too  much to bear and enkindled some of the sectarian fires that glow just  beneath the surface of civic and cultural life in the west of Scotland.<br><br>He  was forced to quit international football after threats that were  manifest in graffiti painted on the street where he lived in Glasgow and  in his home town of Lurgan. &quot;I had played nearly 40 times for Northern  Ireland before I came to Glasgow and had no problems,&quot; he said in 2010.  &quot;But that all changed after I joined Celtic.&quot;<br><br>He has been  physically attacked and abused in the street, and a handful of Rangers  fans have been imprisoned as a result. This year, two men were jailed  for attempting to send an explosive device to Lennon through the post.<br><br>Until  recently, though, he has been regularly caricatured in the Scottish  press as an immature hothead and a loose cannon who was somehow partly  responsible for the vicissitudes he has encountered. One former Scotland  international, writing in a Sunday newspaper, even suggested Lennon had  brought the death threats upon himself because of his edgy demeanour.<br><br>As  they flock to praise him now they adopt a supercilious tone in the  manner of a headmaster handing over the best-pupil prize to a classroom  miscreant who has changed his ways. The patronising tone has not gone  unnoticed by Celtic&#39;s chief executive, Peter Lawwell, and it irks him.  &quot;What people are seeing now is the real Neil Lennon, a man who is highly  intelligent, articulate and gifted. We have always known this, though,  ever since he started working with us as a player, then captain and now  manager.<br><br>&quot;Yes, he has changed in the three years he has been  manager, but only in the way most people change, including me, three  years into any job. There were a few occasions when Neil reacted in a  way that he later regretted, but Alex Ferguson, Ars&egrave;ne Wenger and Jos&eacute;  Mourinho have all reacted similarly in the heat of battle.&quot;<br><br>When  Lawwell speaks about his manager there is barely concealed pride and  affection for him. Much of this stems from his achievements as a player  and now manager, but also from the way Lennon conducted himself in the  face of &quot;events that no other manager in world football has ever had to  endure&quot;.<br><br>Nor will it have escaped the chief executive&#39;s notice  that his young manager is building a solid reputation beyond Britain. He  is now in his third full season as manager of Celtic and club insiders  believe he is capable of taking them to heights unimagined since Jock  Stein&#39;s Lisbon Lions reached two European Cup finals and two semi-finals  in the 1960s and 70s.<br><br>In Lennon&#39;s first season as a Champions  League manager Celtic stand poised to qualify for the last 16. Their  titanic tactical struggles in the Barcelona double-header have  captivated a new audience. Barcelona granted Celtic little more than 20%  of possession over their two games, yet this was no frantic  anywhere-will-do, rearguard action. Gary Neville, the former Manchester  United defender, was impressed. &quot;It wasn&#39;t desperate defending; it  wasn&#39;t legs on the floor, flailing around and diving in. They were  controlled, they stayed on their feet. They all did their jobs in a  disciplined manner.&quot;<br><br>They played a bit, too. What also  characterised both games against Barcelona was that Celtic had several  players who could hurt their lauded opponents. That they did this so  effectively was also due to the way Lennon deployed them. He played with  two strikers, knowing that his team would have the chance to break and  thus secure some dead-ball opportunities. He made them keep a  relentlessly narrow shape in the knowledge that Barcelona are  uncomfortable playing crosses from wide and that Celtic now have a some  intelligent defenders playing together at the same time.<br><br>Those  who think that Lennon&#39;s imminent departure to the Premier League is  inevitable may be unable to grasp the strength of the relationships  Lennon has forged at Celtic. Last Tuesday, the eve of the Barcelona  fixture, 1,000 worshippers crowded into St Mary&#39;s church in Glasgow&#39;s  east end for a mass and celebration to mark the 125th anniversary of  Celtic. The club&#39;s board and management were joined by seven Barcelona  directors who were surprised to learn their slogan, M&eacute;s que un club, had  been coined by a Celtic chairman years earlier in a documentary made to  mark their annus mirabilis of 1967, when they became the first British  team to win the European Cup.<br><br>Earlier that day, as if to  underline their commitment to social responsibility, Celtic had  announced a gift of &pound;120,000 to four schools to enable pupils to play  musical instruments after local authority cuts in musical provision. In  the past two years, the club has established initiatives in India and  Mexico, where poor communities will receive coaching, football kit and  regular visits to Glasgow. The locations were chosen in the knowledge  that there will be no commercial spin-off.<br><br>Those close to Lennon  speak of his appreciation of Celtic&#39;s commitment to social justice and  the way in which Lawwell and Dermot Desmond, the club&#39;s largest  shareholder, stood shoulder to shoulder with him when it seemed one  strand of Scottish society had unilaterally declared war on him.<br><br>He  has had to deal with clinical depression and speaks regularly at events  to help fellow sufferers. Lennon is also venerated by the Celtic  supporters. Barcelona&#39;s players lined up to say that the Celtic fans&#39;  fervour was unlike anything they had previously encountered, and  Lennon&#39;s bond with them is the strongest of any of the club&#39;s 17  managers.<br><br>Some also believe that there would be an incongruity in  Lennon managing an English club that is the mere plaything of foreign  plutocrats; where success can be bought rather than earned and where the  desire for instant gratification has rendered the values of sacrifice  and industry utterly redundant.<br><br>Lennon&#39;s entire career has been  lived in the shadow of adversity; it is as if he is destined always to  scale his heights by the north face in winter while others are granted a  gentler route. He may be at Celtic for some time yet.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Spiers on Lennon</h3>THURSDAY 6 DECEMBER 2012 TEXT SIZE Spiers on Sport: Neil Lennon has confounded everyone<br><br>Spiers on Sport<br>Graham Spiers<br>There was a point not much more than 12 months ago when Neil Lennon was lamenting his fate as Celtic manager.<br><br><b>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to get the chance to build the type of team I want to see here,&rdquo; </b>he said.<br><br>Lennon  felt that time was running out on him. At that point, back in the early  winter of 2011, Rangers looked like they were streaking ahead in the  title race, while Lennon&rsquo;s Celtic were toiling.<br><br>And, as much as the Celtic fans loved him, the catcalls were beginning to ring in his ears around Celtic Park.<br><br>It  is instructive to think back to some of the chatter among fans and the  media in those months. Lennon, it was felt, wasn&rsquo;t working out. Ally  McCoist, himself an untried manager at Rangers, appeared to be getting  the better of him. It looked like Lennon would be binned &ndash; he felt it  himself.<br><br>Now look where we are. Lennon has performed a minor  miracle &ndash; Celtic have actually beaten the modern, dazzling Barcelona &ndash;  and his team are in the last 16 of the Champions League. The fact that  some are even tipping Lennon and Celtic to reach the last eight is a  remarkable state of affairs.<br><br>Lennon has confounded just about  everyone &ndash; including me. He was deemed too young, too raw, too impetuous  for the Celtic job. It was said he created unwanted tabloid headlines.<br><br>I  remember one seasoned Scottish football observer saying: &ldquo;Celtic have  made a grave mistake in handing the manager&rsquo;s job to Neil Lennon &ndash; he is  too callow and he lacks discipline.&rdquo;<br><br>Lennon is a bloke I like a  lot, but I created a minor tension between us by writing a column which  cast doubt on the wisdom of the club giving him the job back in May  2010.<br><br>I thought Celtic was too big a club for him - or for anyone  - going into his first managerial job. In fact, the logic of that  argument still doesn&rsquo;t seem so flawed.<br><br>But Lennon is succeeding  at Celtic where older, more experienced coaches might have failed. He  has done so by an ability to learn lessons as he goes along, by an  intelligent understanding of football, but also through a strength of  character.<br><br>The last point probably cannot be overestimated. I&rsquo;m  not talking about any of the off-field lunacy he has had to deal with.  Rather, one of Lennon&rsquo;s strengths as a player was his ability not to be  fazed or overawed by anything.<br><br>For instance, when Lennon and  Celtic went away to play teams as prestigious as Juventus and Bayern  Munichunder Martin O&rsquo;Neill in the Champions League, it scarcely entered  Lennon&rsquo;s head that he might look inferior on the pitch.<br><br>On the contrary, he believed he could square up to anybody.<br><br>It  will be lost on no-one that, in five years in Glasgow, O&rsquo;Neill never  once took Celtic to the Champions League&rsquo;s last 16 in three attempts,  while Lennon has done it after his first taste of the group stage.<br><br>Gordon  Strachan managed it twice after O&rsquo;Neill left, and now Lennon has added  to these feats. The fact is, as vulnerable and headstrong as we all  believed Lennon to be, he now stands comfortably beside these two  figures in Celtic&rsquo;s recent history, while still only being 41.<br><br>It  is by no means a scene of flawless progress. Celtic have stumbled in  the SPL and, thus far, Lennon has failed to find an answer to that.<br><br>There  have also been recurring, key moments when a Celtic team has faltered  under him: against Ross County and Kilmarnock at Hampden; fatally  against Inverness Caledonian Thistle in April 2011; and even against  Arbroath last week.<br><br>On all of these occasions against inferior opponents, Lennon has looked nonplussed, unable to explain where it went wrong.<br><br>But  today, having guided Celtic astutely through this Champions League  group stage, Lennon looks a figure of substance. He has talked  convincingly about his plans throughout this European campaign so far.  He also has a deep &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for Celtic and what the club requires, which  is no handicap.<br><br>Neil Lennon is some way off from entering the pantheon &ndash; and he might never make it. Right now, though, his stock is rising.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Hibernian v Celtic: Past year has left Neil Lennon craving further success</h3>Hugh Macdonald<br>Chief Sports Writer<br><br>THE message was simple and straightforward.<br>Neil  Lennon looks back on 2012 with pride, but only briefly. He is consumed  by 2013 and beyond. A year that gave him his first championship, a  sensational victory over Barcelona and qualification for the knockout  stages of the Champions League is savoured before the manager  immediately says: &quot;You reflect on it for a few days and then you go on.&quot;<br><br>This  philosophy was marked yesterday by Lennon twice insisting that he did  not want to be a &quot;one-season wonder&quot; and setting a points tally for his  players in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League that will be unfulfilled  if the side drops more than five points by the end of the season.<br><br>The  Northern Irishman also looked forward to a League Managers&#39; Association  (LMA) meeting next month with Sir Alex Ferguson and others at the FA&#39;s  centre of excellence at St George&#39;s in Staffordshire. January will also  include a few days in Spain with the team in the mid-season break before  Lennon heads to England to watch transfer targets. And then the  Champions League resumes in February.<br><br>He is aware of the stress.  &quot;I keep myself healthy even if it does not look like it,&quot; he said. &quot;I  train two or three times a week &ndash; not heavily, but I keep myself ticking  over.&quot;<br><br>But he admitted &quot;private time&quot; was almost non-existent.  He added of next month: &quot;I&#39;m hoping to get a week away with the family  but, even then, I might have to go and watch games while I&#39;m away, so it  is virtually 12 months in the year. Even when you&#39;re on holiday, the  chief executive rings every day &ndash; &#39;What about this player? What about  that player? Can we get this contract signed?&quot;&#39;<br><br>He will seek advice from Ferguson and others on how to manage time more effectively.<br><br>He  is keen to emphasise, however, that the Celtic job is not a burden. &quot;I  love it,&quot; he said succinctly, though he added with a smile: &quot;There&#39;s  pressure on me to win the title, trophies and the European Cup . . .&quot;<br><br>The  drive, though, comes from within. &quot;I&#39;ve got to be very mindful that  we&#39;re not a one-season wonder. Everything is great at the minute and  we&#39;re getting a lot of pats on the back,&quot; he said of the invitation to  the LMA conference.<br><br>Then, in answer to another question about the  Celtic model of recruitment being looked at favourably in England, he  said: &quot;I don&#39;t want to be a one-season wonder. I&#39;d like it to be a  consistent run in the Champions League and that&#39;s going to be very  difficult.&quot;<br><br>He is constitutionally unable to accept the  possibility of an era of Celtic dominance in the wake of the travails of  Rangers. &quot;Everyone says we are going to win six or seven in a row. That  does not really float my boat. Each season has its own challenges and  its own merits. I just think about making a steady progression and  turning this team, and club, into the way it was under Martin O&#39;Neill  and Gordon Strachan,&quot; he said. &quot;That takes time and patience and  development. Not just from the players, but from myself. Every season is  another challenge. Every competition is another challenge. Everyone has  us winning the treble but it has only been done three times in the  history of the club.&quot;<br><br>The players have been told of the  expectations for the domestic season. &quot;We have 40 points at the moment  after 19 games. If you use that as a guide to the second half of the  season, you will end up with 80. And for me, that&#39;s nowhere near good  enough,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;Our previous two totals have been 92 and 93. So  with 19 games left, that is 57 points to play for. If they won every  game that would take it to 97, so the motivation is not to drop five  points and try to end up on the same total as the last two seasons.<br><br>&quot;That  is what I am looking at. The reason we have dropped points in the first  half, is that we were very inconsistent at time because of the  Champions League. They do not have that to worry about. They can kick  on.&quot;<br><br>There is a moment to look back on what has been achieved.  &quot;Pride &ndash; a huge amount of pride,&quot; said Lennon of his dominant feeling  about 2012. &quot;You don&#39;t have time to reflect in this job. You sit on it  for a day or two and then you go again. It&#39;s one of those years where  you don&#39;t want it to end, really, and it&#39;ll be quite poignant when it  does end, in terms of what we&#39;ve achieved, winning the championship and  then obviously the titanic games in the Champions League.&quot;<br><br>However,  he added: &quot;I&#39;ve really, really enjoyed it but you always worry about  what&#39;s ahead of you. You can&#39;t forget qualifying for the Champions  League. What&#39;s the next step? We might get to the last eight. That&#39;s the  next challenge for me. Can we maintain this run in the league? Can we  play the football that brings the punters in through the door? If we  could get [James] Forrest fit for a week it would help.&quot;<br><br>There is  a smile in this observation but there is a seriousness, too, and it  chimes with the mood of a manager whose first taste of success has set  up an unquenchable craving.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">  Tom English: Neil Lennon deserves the prize</span><br></h3><span class="diffAdd">The Scotsman</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">By TOM ENGLISH</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Published on 12/05/2013 00:00</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Deadlines have passed and votes have been cast in the end-of-season awards merry-go-round with the humble scribblers soon to dish out their gongs after the players did so last weekend.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">While Danny McGrain ever-so-slightly overstated Neil Lennon&rsquo;s case for manager of the year the other day &ndash; the great man said that Lennon should be knighted for beating Barcelona &ndash; it would have been something of a travesty if the Celtic manager hadn&rsquo;t got the nod for the football writers&rsquo; prize, having already missed out to Allan Johnston in the PFA Scotland ceremony.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">There were several candidates but Lennon stood out above all others. A huge claim could be made for Stuart McCall and the constant improvement on a pretty meagre budget that he has brought to Fir Park. Derek Adams deserves a shout. So, too, Terry Butcher and, of course, Johnston, who has won two trophies after inheriting a relegated and demoralised crew at Queen of the South.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">If Lennon&rsquo;s candidacy had been based purely on the domestic game then, frankly, he wouldn&rsquo;t have got near the award. Sure, this has been a championship-winning season for Celtic with the trophy being handed over yesterday. It looked like an achievement of great significance. It sure as hell sounded like it. If an alien had suddenly fetched up at Celtic Park and saw what was going on they&rsquo;d have thought that it was a seismic event.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic&rsquo;s league campaign has been nothing to write home about. Certainly nothing to make you hand out awards. In the league (and in the wounding League Cup semi-final loss to St Mirren) Celtic have been ponderous too often, their manager regularly reaching for the angry button in trying to wake them up from their domestic slumber. They have won the championship with a record low points total, losing and drawing too many games for this league title to stand alongside any of the others they have won. They have dropped points in 14 of their 36 matches.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">No. Given the monstrous advantage they have over their rivals in budgetary terms, Lennon would struggle to get in the top four of the managers&rsquo; award if it was based purely on what happened in the SPL, championship or no championship.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">What elevated him was Europe. Consider what the season would have been like had Celtic not taken us all on an adventure that lasted into March.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">What would we have lived through? The funereal drumbeat of league reconstruction, the politics and power struggle at Rangers, the implosion of Dunfermline, the trauma at Hearts. There&rsquo;s been some great stuff in other places but the landscape without those European games would have been bleak, as grey as November. An endless winter.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">For too long Scotland has been crying out for relevance on the international stage and rarely does it come. Mostly, the only occasion in recent times when the outside world has deigned to look Scotland&rsquo;s way is when the Old Firm have served up some toxic brew or when an institution is on the brink of collapse. The Sky Sports News cameras have rarely come here on the back of a good news story. They haven&rsquo;t tended to &ldquo;cross to Scotland&rdquo; with a cheery air.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Nearly always, with the occasional exception, they do so in order to broadcast the poison, the dark side of football. Sectarianism, bombs in the post, reaction on the riots in Manchester, spats over banners and songs. Without this stuff over the last number of years Scottish football would have been of little interest to Sky. They pay for the football, yes. But mostly they want to tap into the madness.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">That has lessened hugely since Celtic and Rangers were separated. Personally, their rivalry is not missed, but many do miss it and a good portion of them are Celtic fans, even if they never care to admit it openly. Celtic have missed what Rangers provide at their best. Rangers could have kept Celtic on their toes rather than freewheeling. It&rsquo;s fair to say that Lennon&rsquo;s team&rsquo;s domestic slip-ups probably wouldn&rsquo;t have happened &ndash; not in such large numbers at any rate &ndash; if Rangers had been setting the pace or breathing down their neck. It wasn&rsquo;t a lack of ability that made them drop so many points, it was the lack of fear factor, the absence of a rival laying claim to the title.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic are a better team than their SPL performances have shown. We can say that because we&rsquo;ve seen them in Europe. Everybody has seen them in Europe. For a while, they changed how others saw Scottish football. They brought international respect on account of their football rather than international fascination on account of the kind of unsavoury things that the Scottish game usually hits the headlines for.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">On the night that Celtic beat Barcelona, the European game stopped looking at the game in this country in the manner of a scientist looking at a rat.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic played a dozen games in Europe, won seven of them and drew another. The ones that they lost were to the team that are about to win La Liga, the team that have just won Serie A and the team that are in pole position to win the Portuguese league, having also made their way into this week&rsquo;s final of the Europa League, where they will play Chelsea. They also drew with Benfica at home and only lost to Barcelona away because of a late, late winner. They beat HJK Helsinki home and away, beat Helsingborgs (currently top of the Swedish league) home and away, they beat Spartak Moscow home and away.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Of course, they had the benefit of good fortune along the way, but no side gets that lucky that often if the only thing they have going for them is a kindly bounce of the ball.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Fraser Forster was arguably the goalkeeper of the group stage. Victor Wanyama, in the games against Barcelona, was as good as any central midfielder in the competition. There were remarkable performances from many players in that campaign and all of them were brought in by Lennon, a manager who has developed considerably while away from the distraction and the intensity of Old Firm football.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I&rsquo;m not sure if Lennon misses the white heat of battle against a competitive Rangers but his management has improved without it, no question.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He is now being talked of as a contender for the Everton job. It may prove too early for him. Lennon has a huge ambition but has little experience and could do with another year in Glasgow, another shot at the Champions League, another season to mature. It would be no great hardship. He&rsquo;s at a club that he loves, he&rsquo;s winning trophies and he&rsquo;s got a European challenge to come. That is where he excelled this season. For that alone, he deserves the prize.  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br><h3><br></h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><h3><br></h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br></div>
