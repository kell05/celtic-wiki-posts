They didn&#39;t but dropped down to the Uefa Cup. Would have been humiliating for ourselves to go out to such a lowly side. <br>  </li><li>  Shakhter Karagandy are from Kazakhstan and this is the first time a Kazakh side has played at Celtic Park. <br>  </li><li>  Injury time winner seals it for Celtic, coming from behind in the two legs of the match, lost first match 2-0. We never do things the easy way. <br>  </li><li>  Uefa announce that sheep slaughter is not permitted at grounds, as is a custom for Kazakh sides and occurred at first leg match prior to game. <br>  </li><li>  Draw is tomorrow for group stages. <br>  </li><li>  Samaras scores again a vital goal in Europe; Europe seems to bring the best out in him. <br>  </li><li>  First time clawed back a 2-0 deficit in Europe since Cologne in UEFA Cup in early 90s. The fourth time in five occasions Celtic have overhauled a 2-0 away first leg deficit - St Etienne 1968 (4-2 agg), Sporting Lisbon 1983 (5-2 agg), Cologne 1992 (3-2 agg). Real Sociedad 1982 (2-3 agg) in 1982 remains the only disappointment.</li>    <li>  Expected transfers to go through in coming days as they were contingent on us getting through to Champions League group stages. <br>  </li><li>  Summertime and the transfer window is underway. <br>  </li><li>  Out so far: Miku, Lassad, Rogne, Wanyama, Hooper, Daryl Murphy, Wilson, Paddy McCourt <br>  </li><li>  In so far: Amido Bald&eacute;, Van Dijk, Mouyokolo, Boerrigter <br>  </li><li>  Paddy McCourt signs for Barnsley. </li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Review<img align="right" alt="2013-08-28: Celtic 3-0 Shakter Karagandy, European Cup - Pic" height="271" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/0QR-8QUT6gx0Rmh-iie6NQ59795/GW437H271" title="2013-08-28: Celtic 3-0 Shakter Karagandy, European Cup - Pic" width="437"></h3>Neil Lennon speaking to media: &quot;It&#39;s the greatest thing I have ever done in football.&quot;   <br>Neil Lennon &#39;This is the greatest night of my footballing life...

It was a nailbiting, tense, rip roaring game which made the blood coarse and vocalised delight frustrations at players and situations.<br><br>I could mention those that I thought were good or off-form but it would be pointless at this moment. Suffice to say that some were better than others but in the end it worked out for us.<br><br>When they hit the bar you realise that there is a fine line between us being elated or totally gutted. We posters who are talking about how well we played, how great players were, how brilliant the manager is, would possibly be mentioning the same incidents from a negative point of view if we hadn&#39;t got through, say on penalties.<br><br>Therefore now is the time to take it in and enjoy the moment.<br>We&#39;re in the Champions League. Again.<br>We have the draw to look forward to this evening.<br>We can spend the day dreaming of the dream or nightmare group.<br><br>From now until the first game in the group stage, we have a lot of speculation and chat to go through, so let&#39;s just enjoy it. The SPFLPL games are secondary for now.<br>The anticipation and excitement pre-tournament is one of the best things we have before we get the reality check playing the big boys.<br><br>It doesn&#39;t get any better than this. <br><br>(Paul Wilson of KDS forum)<br>Stokes &ndash;

The visitors were themselves unlucky not to score a crushing away goal midway through the second half but will have to content themselves a place in the Europa Cup.<br><br>Celtic, making three changes from the first leg, had the obvious intent of testing Aleksandr Mokin as early as possible but the Shakhter goalkeeper, whose handling had been woeful in Astana, responded well. Mikael Lustig&#39;s far post header from a Kris Commons cross had the crowd on their feet but Mokin punched the ball over the bar.<br><br>Although Fraser Forster had to stretch low to save a shot from Sergei Khizhnichenko, Celtic continued to pound the Shakhter penalty box with shots and crosses. Forrest forced another save from Mokin and the goalkeeper continued to dispel the image he had presented in the home game when he palmed away another goalbound effort, this time from the lively Anthony Stokes.<br><br>Next up in the effort to secure the relaxant of an early goal was Commons with a wicked free kick which Mokin, not so convincingly this time, pushed to safety. It seemed Celtic must score but somehow the Kazakhstan side survived. With almost half an hour played there was a reminder of the doomsday scenario for the home side of a Shakhter away goal when Aldin Dzidic headed over Forster&#39;s bar in a rare attack.<br><br>Encouraged, the visitors enjoyed their best spell of the half with Lustig required to block a Khizhnichenko attempt. Both Celtic and the crowd were subdued and the game entering injury time when Commons gloriously transformed a fruitless first half by unleashing a venomous shot from 25 yards to put his side unexpectedly, if deservedly, ahead. The psychological impact of the goal negated any need for Lennon to give a state of the nation address in the home dressing room at half time.<br><br>If anything his players started the second period even more pumped up than they had been in the first and this time they got their reward quickly. Just three minutes, and much Celtic pressing, were on the clock when Lustig&#39;s shot from the edge of the box landed at the feet of Georgios Samaras. From close range he put Celtic level on aggregate with almost the whole of the second half to find the third which, if not responded to at the other end, would take the Glasgow club into the group stage for a second successive season.<br><br>They very nearly got that goal when Forrest sent over a teasing cross which found Stokes unmarked at the far post. He should have buried it but instead his right foot volley hit the bar. Just how vulnerable Celtic&#39;s position was couldn&#39;t have been more vividly illustrated than in the next two minutes.<br><br>First Adam Matthews, guarding the far post, had to desperately scoop Dzidic&#39;s net bound shot off the line and then Shakhter came even closer. In the first game the long throws into the box of Gediminas Vicius had caused the Celtic defence undue problems and there was a mighty sigh of relief when Khizhnichenko&#39;s effort from another launched ball hit the bar.<br><br>Even if they did not score, the visitors made it clear that they were not going to roll over and provided a timely warning to Celtic that they could not attack with abandon in pursuit of the third goal. With the game ebbing and flowing more evenly than at any other point the spectacle was gripping, both teams aware that one slip would consign them to the Europa League.<br><br>Almost unbelievably, lightning struck twice as the game went into injury time with an extra 30 minutes, and possibly penalties as well, looming. This time it was Forrest, who had been lively but often lacking a finishing flourish, who redeemed himself by sweeping home Stokes&#39; low cut back and send Celtic Park into raptures. <br><br><br><h3>  (Reuters)</h3>Celtic winger James Forrest scored a dramatic stoppage time winner to secure his club a Champions League group stage place on Wednesday alongside AC Milan, Real Sociedad, Zenit St Petersburg and Czech champions Viktoria Plzen.   <br>The five clubs will go into Thursday&#39;s 32-team draw for the lucrative group phase.<br>Celtic, inspired by the fervour of their Glasgow supporters, overturned a two-goal deficit from the first leg to beat Shakhter Karagandy of Kazakhstan 3-0 and secure a group stage spot for the second year in a row.<br>They overcame early jitters to score through Kris Commons on the stroke of halftime and then levelled the aggregate tally through Giorgios Samaras early in the second half.<br>The 3-2 aggregate triumph was secured with only seconds remaining at the end of a mazy run through the defence from Anthony Stokes that set up Forrest&#39;s goal for a grandstand finish to maintain the tradition of rousing nights of European competition at Celtic Park.<br>&quot;This is the greatest night of my football life,&quot; said Celtic manager Neil Lennon. &quot;I never come across Real Madrid, so that&#39;s something I&#39;d like and a Battle of Britain would be great as well.<br>&quot;But I don&#39;t care. I&#39;m just delighted that we will be in the Champions League again.&quot;<br>(Reporting by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by John Mehaffey)<br><br><h3>  Spiers on Sport: passionate Celtic knock down Champions League door again</h3>Spiers on Sport   <br>Graham Spiers<br>Wednesday 28 August 2013<br><br>What an occasion for Neil Lennon and Celtic against Shakhter Karagandy in Glasgow. The pressure was huge on Celtic tonight, yet they prevailed once more.<br><br>In turning around a 2-0 first-leg deficit with an impassioned 3-0 home win in the Champions League play-off, Celtic once more enhanced their status as a club with lofty ambition and a hint of European elitism about it.<br><br>This football institution based in Glasgow&#39;s impoverished east end, the first British club to win the European Cup, is back once again in the Champions League group stage. It is where Celtic and their carousing supporters feel they belong.<br><br>Everything in this business is relative. Viktor Kumykov&#39;s Karagandy are, at best, an ordinary team, so there can be no claims to world-beating about this.<br><br>But for Lennon and Celtic, in a difficult age for Scottish footballl, to twice now march into the Champions League over two successive years seems pretty impressive.<br><br>Lennon continues to attract doubters - and some criticisms of his style are merited. He can snarl, he can be a loose cannon, he is confrontational.<br><br>But the Celtic manager is also thoughtful, robust and inspirational in his work, as is now perfectly plain in Glasgow. Lennon continues to be very good for this club.<br><br>Apart from the glory, the finances of making the group-stage also mean everything to Celtic.<br><br>In European terms the club is perennially cash-starved merely by belonging to Scottish football, so the guaranteed &pound;17 million of Champions League football - with gate money on top - is mesmerising to a club whose annual income is currently locked at around &pound;51 million.<br><br>The Celtic board, probably unfairly, has taken stick from the club&#39;s more splenetic supporters for &quot;failing to invest&quot; in the team. Peter Lawwell, the Celtic CEO, contests the charge, but is also storing wealth for a longer-term strategy, including the eventual return of Rangers.<br><br>These issues are forever on a knife-edge. Celtic, most believe, have been a highly impressive club in terms of their finances in recent years. Nonetheless, the knives would have been out for the Celtic board had this Karagandy team not been dismissed over the two games.<br><br>Celtic were awash with passion and heroism on the night, and their three goals sent a bulging Parkhead into raptures. But the home side were also lucky not to be reduced by a red card in the first half.<br><br>This game could have turned disastrously, with Scott Brown, on top of all his other qualities, revealing his self-destructive tendency once more. Celtic were fortunate not to be reduced to 10 men after 40 minutes following their captain&#39;s blatant stamp on Gediminas Vicius. The referee, Sven Oddvar Moen, missed the moment.<br><br>Over the decades there have been a few special European goals witnessed at Celtic Park, but few will forget the screamer that Kris Commons delivered for Celtic with just seconds remaining of the first half.<br><br>From 25 yards Commons sent a precisely weighted missile past Aleksandr Mokin and inside his post to finally break the deadlock. It was a much-needed breakthrough for Celtic, whose pounding of Karagandy had been fruitless. Georgios Samaras, and then James Forrest with three minutes remaining, completed the feat.<br><br>This was a night of high drama for Celtic. But these 180 minutes against the Kazaks were made fraught in other ways.<br><br>The fact is, Celtic endured these tests without a cemented central defence and, indeed, mixed and matched to slightly desperate effect to try to get it right.<br><br>In Kazakhstan last week Lennon placed two new boys, Virgil van Dijk and Steven Mouyokolo, as centre-backs, though it signally failed. In this second-leg the Celtic manager went with Efe Ambrose and Mikael Lustig in these positions, the first being a risk, the latter not noted in the role.<br><br>It was a risk Lennon and Celtic could have done without. Something has been lacking in the way the club has handled the departure of Kelvin Wilson and scrambled to fill the void. It left Lennon&#39;s team patched-up and improvised for its two most lucrative matches of the season, and at times Celtic&#39;s rearguard looked shaky.<br><br>There may yet be time and money with which to fix that. In the meantime, with perfect justification, Celtic can once more celebrate continuing success on the journey. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>BBC   <br>By Clive Lindsay BBC Sport<br>Comments (390)<br><br>James Forrest&#39;s stoppage-time strike took Celtic into the Champions League group stage after a dramatic aggregate win over Shakhter Karagandy.<br><br>It took until time added on in the first half for Celtic to reduce the 2-0 first-leg deficit through a superb long-range strike from Kris Commons.<br><br>But Georgios Samaras then levelled the tie three minutes after the break.<br><br>Both sides struck the crossbar before Anthony Stokes set up Forrest to fire home for a deserved, if nervy, win.<br><br>The strike sent a delirious Neil Lennon sprinting along the touchline to join in the celebrations with his players, as Celtic Park erupted in noise in front of a watching Nir Biton, the Israeli star set to join on a three-year deal this week.<br><br>&quot;That was the greatest thing I&#39;ve ever done in football,&quot; said Lennon.<br><br>&quot;The last three months were in preparation for this.

You are asking the wrong person.<br><br>&quot;We came into this with no real help, which makes it even more remarkable what we have achieved tonight.&quot;<br><br>Lennon praised his players who have reached the group stage for the second year running and who he believes were wrongfully criticised for their performance in the first leg.<br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon<br><br>Lennon believes his side dominated both legs of the play-off tie<br><br>&quot;I am relieved; there&#39;s a great sense of pride in what we&#39;ve achieved tonight considering we lost Hooper, Wanyama and Kelvin, who were the spine of the team really for the last year and a half,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m angry as well at the reaction from the first leg to the team.<br><br>&quot;For my liking, the environment here is all wrong - there&#39;s far too much negativity.<br><br>&quot;These players have given everything for the club and put Scottish football in a very good light last year.<br><br>&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say they had a bad night last week. They just didn&#39;t take their chances.<br><br>&quot;And yet the hysteria afterwards was disgusting. It may have come from some quarters of the media, it may have come from some quarters of our own support.<br><br>&quot;But the knee-jerk reaction to one average performance is baffling to me and it just makes the job impossible at times.&quot;<br><br>Anthony Stokes returned to the side following injury to set up James Forrest for the winning goal in stoppage time.<br><br>&quot;Wonderful piece of skill from Stokes, who I thought did really well to last the course of the game considering he hasn&#39;t played for a little while,&quot; added Lennon.<br><br>&quot;And James Forrest, who for some reason a section of our support can&#39;t take to, I don&#39;t know why because he&#39;s one of the best players to have played for this club for a long time.<br><br>&quot;I thought he was brilliant tonight and he comes up with a goal that&#39;s worth its weight in gold for us.&quot; <br><br><br><br><h3>  Tom English: Another great Celtic escape in Europe</h3>The Scotsman   <br><br>by TOM ENGLISH<br><br>Published on the 29 August<br>2013<br>00:00<br><br>48 comments<br>Email this Print this<br><br>THE probability is that if you quizzed each and every one of these Celtic players about the famous acts of escapology in the club&rsquo;s storied past in European competition then you wouldn&rsquo;t get much in the way of detail.<br><br>Jock Stein&rsquo;s team coming back from the dead against St Etienne in 1968. Davie Hay&rsquo;s side turning it around against Sporting Lisbon in 1983. John Collins&rsquo; winner against Cologne in 1993. Modern players don&rsquo;t tend to know their history, but on nights like this, when they&rsquo;re writing the history all by themselves, then it really doesn&rsquo;t matter a damn what they know or don&rsquo;t know.<br><br>Shakhter couldn&rsquo;t hold a candle to any of those other rivals that have fallen at Celtic Park over the years but they still took a hell of a lot of beating. It took until added time until they were seen off, a stake plunged into their big hearts which almost &ndash; almost &ndash; camouflaged the awful weaknesses in their game. It looked to all the world as if the night was headed for another 30 angst-ridden minutes. By that time you would have forgiven the support had they had the very life drained out of them, but like their team they were energised to the end. They elevated their team with their noise. Drove them on. It was Anthony Stokes who engineered the winner and James Forrest who poked it home, but they had a stadium running with them. Not a triumph of the 11, but of the tens of thousands.<br><br>The Celtic support could not have done more for their team, truly they couldn&rsquo;t. They turned up in vast numbers with their hope and their fears and their desperation, too, and made the kind of noise that would have awoken the dead. The teams emerged; a wall of sound. The break-up of the huddle; a crescendo. The kick-off, the first chance, the second, the third, the fourth; GBH of the ear-hole every single time. And the goals? Well, that was a hubbub of a different order.<br><br>It was a bearpit out there. It was always likely to be, in fairness. As a team, Shakhter have little subtlety and little interest in those who point out their deficiencies. We might call them agricultural in their play and they don&rsquo;t care. We might think for an hour to list their assets and not come up with much beyond organised and physical and lucky but through their manager, Viktor Kumykov, they have made it abundantly obviously that our opinions are not worth a damn to them.<br><br>They just came thundering out into the Celtic Park night and clattered anything that moved. Lennon had a word with the fourth official about it, gently brandishing an imaginary card as a reminder that his colleague was permitted to show some colour. Only 14 minutes had been played at that point. It was that kind of scrap. That kind of night.<br><br>A sheep was not the only thing sacrificed since these two teams hooked-up. Last night, Lennon culled three-quarters of his defence from the first leg. They had their own anxious moments but they did their job and down the other end &ndash; where it all had to happen &ndash; a job was done, too. Late and dramatic and euphoric and lucrative. Three goals and about sixteen million quid, just for starters. Back-to-back Champions League qualification for Neil Lennon. What a huge feat, this is. A feat achieved without the spine of the team that got them there last year. Stunning and nerve-shredding all at the same time.<br><br>When Commons and Samaras scored the dynamic changed. Oh how it changed. Consider the Shakhter mindset before Commons rifled his shot low past Aleksandr Mokin followed soon after the break by Samaras&rsquo; tap-in. They&rsquo;d seen Mikael Lustig miss from a close-range header inside five minutes, they&rsquo;d watched Stokes take the ball around their goalkeeper after 10 minutes but they cleared his effort off the line. They&rsquo;d seen Forrest&rsquo;s shot tipped over and Stokes&rsquo; header clawed away, they&rsquo;d seen Commons&rsquo; free-kick pawed clear by Mokin even though the goalkeeper looked like he hadn&rsquo;t the first clue what he was doing at the time. Commons had put in a beautiful cross at one point but there was nobody there to meet it. Celtic had about five reasonable chances to break the deadlock and hadn&rsquo;t done it.<br><br>Shakhter were in dreamland. Eventually referee Svein Moen of Norway started punishing them and for a short spell he issued yellow cards like he was dishing out snuff at a wake, but Shakhter plodded on regardless. Celtic were huffing and puffing. They were high-energy, high-tempo, high-emotion, but were as low as could be in the goal count and for all the noise and the possession and the chances, goals were the only thing that could save this night from becoming one of the greatest, costliest and most head-wrecking missed opportunities in their history.<br><br>Before the Commons-Samaras double whammy &ndash; and again soon after - you got to thinking about the gallows instead of the goals. Sure, there was buckets of time to go but how many times have we seen a team waste chances only to be punished soon after? Happens all the time. You got to thinking about all of Celtic&rsquo;s chances and their lack of a ruthless goalscorer to bang a few of them in. Gary Hooper&rsquo;s presence in this team seems a lifetime ago. Because Hooper has gone, because Amido Balde is nowhere close to this level and because Celtic have failed to land any one of their 27 targets up front &ndash; or does it just seem like 27? &ndash; their chief striker was Stokes, a player Lennon has rarely trusted in big European games, a player who has only ever scored in one European match in his career and that was an awfully long time ago.<br><br>Stokes it was, though. And Stokes it was who hit the crossbar from point-blank range 15 minutes into the second half. Had he scored, Celtic would have been 3-0 ahead. Not home-free, but setting sail for home. His miss seemed to give Shakhter the mightiest lift. Within three minutes, his team were given two terrifying reminder of how precarious their reality still was despite what Commons and Samaras had done for them. Adam Matthews had to clear off his own line one minute and in the next, Shakhter hit the Celtic crossbar.<br><br>Redemption at the end. Redemption in so many ways. Redemption for Stokes whose brilliant slaloming run created the winner for Forrest. Redemption for last week&rsquo;s horror-show in Kazakhstan. Redemption for Peter Lawwell who would have been hit square between the eyes with the ire of the supporters had Celtic had not pulled this off. Lawwell is now free to loosen the purse strings and spend the kind of money on the kind of player, or players, that will see his team as a competitive force when they rejoin the elite of European football.<br><br>The hilarious irony of the end-game was that Forrest had spent the minutes preceding his winner seemingly asking his manager to take him off. In his moment of triumph, wheeling away to take the acclaim of a stadium that had understandably and brilliantly lost its senses, he suddenly metamorphosed into a boy that you couldn&rsquo;t have removed with a JCB. Celtic Park on such nights? Honestly, you could not make it up. <br></div></div>
