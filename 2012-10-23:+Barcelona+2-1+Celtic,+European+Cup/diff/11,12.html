Photograph: Albert Olive/EPA<br><br>Barcelona claimed their 100th Champions League win courtesy of a stoppage-time winner against a Celtic team who emerged with tremendous credit if no reward.<br><br>The Scottish side stunned Camp Nou by taking the lead, the seventh time already this season that Barcelona have lost the first goal in a match. Later, Celtic were to suffer the cruelty of defeat when only seconds remained.<br><br>The La Liga club recovered from their early setback as Jordi Alba stole in at the back post to secure victory. Barcelona merited that on the balance of play, but they should still afford Celtic quiet respect. &quot;It is a sore one to take, I thought the team was magnificent,&quot; said the Parkhead manager, Neil Lennon.<br><br>&quot;It is bittersweet; it&#39;s hard to take losing in the manner we did but I am so proud of the players. I think we have given the club and the country a huge shot in the arm. We can take a lot from the game. I think we have won a lot more admirers. I am very proud of them tonight, even though I don&#39;t like losing.<br><br>&quot;I said to the players before the game there probably wasn&#39;t a person outside of the dressing room who thought we could get anything, aside from us [the coaching staff] because we know them so well. They are talented young players and people are starting to sit up and take notice of them now, which is fantastic for us. The most important thing is the reputation of the club and we will leave here with that firmly intact.&quot;<br><br>Entering last night&#39;s match, Barcelona had won 14 and lost none of their previous 17 home games in the competition. They also remain unbeaten in La Liga this season, but the concession of 10 goals in their last six outings apparently constitutes cause for local concern.<br><br>There should have been little surprise attached to the fact Celtic spent the opening exchanges toiling to get out of their own half. Alexis S&aacute;nchez, preferred in the home attack to David Villa, should have opened the scoring within two minutes but he screwed the ball wide from a Lionel Messi pass.<br><br>Marc Bartra was the next to threaten, with a header which Fraser Forster sharply batted away. From the subsequent break, however, Celtic created ripples across the European football scene by opening the scoring.<br><br>A foul on Scott Brown during the visitors&#39; counterattack allowed Charlie Mulgrew to curl a menacing free-kick into the Barcelona penalty area. Georgios Samaras was afforded sufficient space to angle a header goalwards; the ball also took a crucial deflection off the shoulder of Javier Mascherano. V&iacute;ctor Vald&eacute;s therefore found his first touch of the ball was to remove it from his net.<br><br>Celtic suffered a double blow in the first half&#39;s dying moments. The influential Samaras limped off with a twisted ankle, moments before Andr&eacute;s Iniesta played a wonderful one-two with Xavi Hern&aacute;ndez and supplied a low finish. Suddenly the tenacity shown by Celtic when not in possession had been clinically undone.<br><br>Barcelona&#39;s vulnerability at cross balls was highlighted again eight minutes after the restart. From a Mulgrew corner, Efe Ambrose headed wide with the Celtic defender&#39;s team-mate, Victor Wanyama, better positioned.<br><br>Messi was denied by a fine save from Forster as Celtic endured a spell on the ropes. The goalkeeper, part of the England party for recent matches against San Marino and Poland, further endorsed that status with a one-handed stop from a Messi header.<br><br>Just as Lennon&#39;s men looked like holding firm &ndash; Villa had struck a post &ndash; Alba intervened. Adriano&#39;s cross eluded the entire Celtic defence, allowing his fellow full-back to score from all of two yards.<br><br>&quot;The top teams go right to the end,&quot; Lennon added. &quot;We have done that ourselves a lot in Scotland. The longer the game went on, the longer Barcelona pressed us into our half. We weathered more or less everything &ndash; it was just one last attack where things didn&#39;t go for us.<br><br>&quot;You have to look at our three games, the team has performed very well in all of those games so far. We always felt it was a three-way fight for second place.&quot;  <br><br><h3>  Last-gasp Barcelona break Celtic hearts</h3>Published: Tuesday 23 October 2012, 23.00CET<br>FC Barcelona 2-1 Celtic FC<br>Jordi Alba&#39;s goal four minutes into second-half stoppage time denied Celtic a point and kept the Catalan club faultless at the top of Group G.<br>by Graham Hunter, UEFA.com<br>from Camp Nou<br><br>Celtic FC were on the verge of registering their third draw at the Camp Nou in eight years until Jordi Alba stunned them with a 94th-minute winner from close range to confirm FC Barcelona&#39;s Group G leadership.<br><br>A first-half own goal from Javier Mascherano rewarded Neil Lennon&#39;s team for playing with calm intelligence and although Andr&eacute;s Iniesta equalised on the stroke of half-time and David Villa hit the post in second-half added time, goalkeeper Fraser Forster appeared to have earned Celtic a valuable point. That was until Adriano arced in a perfect right-wing cross and Alba applied the finish.<br><br>However, what would have concerned Blaugrana coach Tito Vilanova is that Barcelona helped make their night more difficult by ignoring the cardinal rule of taking chances when they arrive. Long before Celtic took the lead the home side should have done so. Iniesta&#39;s visionary pass split the green-and-white defence and although Alexis S&aacute;nchez reached the ball before Forster he somehow skewed the ball past both keeper and far post.<br><br>For Bar&ccedil;a to threaten properly it took the arrival of Marc Bartra, chosen at centre-back for only his third UEFA Champions League match, in the box to connect with an Iniesta centre and force a save from Forster. The value of that stop was doubled when the Scottish champions went in front not long afterwards.<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew&#39;s free-kick was nodded on by Giorgios Samaras but the ball diverted past V&iacute;ctor Vald&eacute;s off Javier Mascherano. Cue wild celebrations up in the highest part of the stadium where around 5,000 visiting fans roared their delight.<br><br>Barcelona reacted. Lionel Messi buzzed two free-kicks into the netting above Forster&#39;s crossbar, and another Iniesta service gave Bartra a second header which he fluffed. Fortune didn&#39;t favour Celtic in that Samaras, author of much of the danger for the hosts, twisted his ankle just before the break and had to be replaced by James Forrest.<br><br>And within moments Bar&ccedil;a were level. Messi slipped a pass into Iniesta and when the midfielder played a wall pass with Xavi he was able to reach the return and stab home a sweetly constructed goal.<br><br>To Celtic&#39;s great credit their second-half display did not waver one centimetre from the game plan. Low strikes from Messi and Iniesta as the match wore on did not particularly test Forster&#39;s reactions, though before the final whistle he needed to excel to repel the 2011 champions.<br><br>His first golden moment came on 68 minutes when Alexis and Pedro Rodr&iacute;guez combined to feed Messi with an opportunity that he volleyed from close range and the Englishman reacted brilliantly to parry. Five minutes later Messi had a point-blank header from which he looked destined to score but the keeper somehow bettered him.<br><br>Sadly for Forster and his team-mates, Alba stole in for the final word just when it seemed their hard work had borne fruit.<br>Related Items<br><br><br>&copy;UEFA.com 1998-2012.

In fact, it was a minor miracle that  Sky&#39;s closing credits didn&#39;t mock up Scott Brown as Mel Gibson in  Braveheart, blue paint slapped on his face and shaking his bum at his  enemies before Jordi Alba supplied the metaphorical arrow to the arse.<br><br>Until  that late, late goal it had been a fantastic performance from Celtic on  a night when Scottish football looked set to record one of its greatest  European results of the past decade. Resolute? Hugely. Determined?  Absolutely. Heroic? Arguably. Fortunate? Probably. But brave? Well, not  exactly.<br><br>Bravery against Barcelona is to go out all guns blazing  and try and take them on at their own game. Suicidal, yes, but  undoubtedly brave in a &#39;Charge of the Light Brigade&#39;, inviting a  massacre kind of way.<br><br>What Celtic did was actually entirely  sensible. Getting men behind the ball in an attempt to deny Barcelona  space and then snatching a goal from a set-piece is basically the only  way to try and combat those tremendously cultured Catalans. Most times  it doesn&#39;t work, but every so often a team will get lucky. This doesn&#39;t  require a particular brand of bravery - it is deeply pragmatic.<br>But  still the process of patronising Celtic begun even before their broken  set of players trudged off the pitch at Camp Nou, their heads clutched  in their hands after Alba&#39;s goal with 30 seconds remaining saw them  defeated.<br><br>The words &#39;brave&#39; and &#39;plucky&#39; - the latter of which,  like &#39;bust-up&#39; or &#39;showdown talks&#39;, only ever seems to apply to football  - were thrown around with abandon, fitting as they did the  pre-prescribed narrative when a weaker team tackles one of the best. We  even had extensive debate about whether Celtic players - professional  players mind - would be more concerned about arranging shirt swaps than  doing their job.<br><br>But to reduce their performance to a concept as  flimsy as mere bravery did Celtic a disservice, suggesting that their  ability to almost hold Barcelona to a draw was merely a near triumph of  the will, of good old British passion.<br><br>It was that, but it was  also a near triumph of tactical discipline, of positional awareness and  of technical excellence in and around their own penalty area.<br><br>The  expert timing of Efe Ambrose&#39;s tackles could not be attributed to  bravery alone, and neither could the performance of the exceptional  Fraser Forster in goal, as he made all manner of saves to prevent Lionel  Messi from scoring his 300th career goal, even if he could not prevent  Andres Iniesta and Alba from turning around Celtic&#39;s improbable lead  given to them by the equally improbable figure of Georgios Samaras.<br><br>It  wasn&#39;t bravery that made him fling out his left arm to expertly parry a  Messi header in the second half - the pick of his eight saves - it was  technique and ability, allied to a bit of muscle memory.<br><br>In fact,  Forster admirably refused to go along with the narrative that Celtic  were merely fortunate just to be on the same pitch as Barca. When asked  whether it was &quot;the best of nights as well as the worst&quot; by Sky, he  replied: &quot;Definitely the worst.&quot;<br><br>So arguably a bad night for  Celtic, ultimately, yet a fine one for football north of the border. It  is only a matter of months since harbingers of doom predicted the death  of Scottish football when Rangers were demoted to the fourth tier  following the club&#39;s rather spectacular bankruptcy and implosion.<br><br>It  was said Celtic would shrivel up without the competition provided by  their enemies in Glasgow yet, having won at Spartak Moscow for their  first ever away win in the Champions League group stage, here they were  within 30 seconds of taking a point off arguably the best team on the  planet. They even prevented Messi from scoring at Camp Nou - an  achievement bordering on remarkable given his strike-rate on home turf.<br><br>Manager  Neil Lennon recognised that Celtic&#39;s performance had a wider  significance. He said: &quot;I thought the team were magnificent. It is  bittersweet really, it is hard to take losing the game in the manner in  which we did but I am so proud of the players, I think they gave the  club and country a huge shot in the arm. There is a mixture of  disappointment and anger that we didn&#39;t see it through to the end of the  game. The players are hurting, they are angry, whatever you want to  call it but it gave them a real a taste of playing in the Champions  League at the highest level and they played fantastically well.&quot;<br><br>Lennon  also succumbed to describing his players as &quot;brave&quot; - and they were, to  an extent at least. But the defining characteristic of what was almost  one of Celtic&#39;s great European nights was something a bit more than just  bravery. It was ability too.<br><br><a class="external" href="http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/early-doors/brave-doesn-t-justice-celtic-display-080034520.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/early-doors/brave-doesn-t-justice-celtic-display-080034520.html</a><br></div>
