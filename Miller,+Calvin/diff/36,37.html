He was even marked as one to watch by the local media in Scotland, and ranked in a poll as the best player in the world at his age. Very commendable, but this can be a burden or even misleading, but high praise indeed. </div><br><div>He finally made his debut for the first team in December 2016 in a 1-0 victory over Partick Thistle to help give him some first team exposure. He was to make a handful of appearances in the following 18mths, and so played a small walk-on role in the wonderful back to back treble winning seasons of 2016-17 &amp; 2017-18 under Brendan Rodgers, and Celtic never conceded a goal in those four games he played in.</div><div></div><div><br>In August 1917, he was rated by some as the man of the match in a 2-0 victory away at Kilmarnock, outshining all the other academy graduates drafted in to play in the team that day (there were five in the line-up that day in Celtic&#39;s side). It boded very well</div><br>The big problem for Calvin Miller was that he had to challenge Kieran Tierney for the left-back role in the first team, and Kieran Tierney at this point was simply peerless. If anything, Calvin Miller had to either wait or adjust to a new role<br><br>For Calvin Miller frustratingly, Izaguirre returned to Celtic for season 2018-19, and so Calvin Miller had to go out on loan to Dundee to help win him first team gametime &amp; experience, but Calvin Miller returned to Celtic in Dec 2018 and was later loaned out to Ayr United in Jan 2019. <br><br>Despite the early praise, it appears the media poll was premature and Calvin Miller was not meeting those unfair expectations. Celtic were having a golden period with youth players, with for example Kieran Tierney a huge star sold for &pound;25m to Arsenal. The question was now where was Calvin Miller to fit into all this? Following Brendan Rodgers&#39; departure, there was room to impress returning <span class="diffAdd">manager </span>Neil Lennon but problems abounded at Celtic and it was not easy for <span class="diffAdd">certain </span>youth players, with a relative abundance of youth talent already being used in the First Team as budgets were tightening and transfer fees were firing way outwith of Celtic&#39;s budgetary reach.<br><br>Celtic tried to transfer him to Kilmarnock as part of a deal to bring in Greg Taylor, but Calvin Miller is reported to have knocked this back, and in turn Celtic bought Greg Taylor outright, but then disaster struck for Calvin Miller when an injury in September 2019 required surgery and ruled him out of matches for the rest of the season. He was to be behind Bolingoli &amp; Greg Taylor in the running for a first team pick.<br><div></div><div><br>He was to leave Celtic in June 2020. It sadly wasn&#39;t to be. COVID-19 had hit the world in March 2020, and it shutdown football everywhere, so for aspiring unestablished footballers, it was doubly worse compared to others in the game. Calvin Miller needed to now look beyond Celtic, as he was long out the picture.</div><div><br>He was leaving with a decent send-off message to all:<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;Ten years of unbelievable memories  and friends for life and been lucky  enough to live my dream so young,  playing such a short part in a  incredible team. Unfortunately all good  things come to an end at some  point but it&rsquo;s time to take the next step  in my career, cheers to  everyone at the club.&rdquo;</i><br></blockquote></div><div><br>We wished him the very best. There was a lot of sympathy for him as many had hoped &amp; believed he had a good chance to establish himself at the club. Celtic was going through a golden era, and he had played an admittedly small role, but still something to very much cherish.</div><div></div><div><b><br>Post-Celtic</b></div><div>[...]<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div><div><h3>Quotes</h3></div><div>Calvin Miller has sent a message to supporters on Instagram as he  confirmed his departure from Celtic next month.

at the Academy to become one of the brightest prospects in the Development side.The talented teenager made his first-team debut against Galatasaray in the Antalya Cup in January 2014 and was included in the matchday squad for the final day of the season this year as the Hoops rounded off five-in-a-row with a stunning 7-0 victory over Motherwell.Miller was also part of the side that won the SPFL Development League title without losing a single match this season, with his goals from the wings and up front playing a crucial role in the championship success.The club wishes Calvin every success

Paul Cuddihy on 20 Dec, 2016 22:58Official site<br> 					<div class="newsShare"> 						 						 						 						 						 						 					</div> 					 				</div> 			 				                 			 					<div class="rtearea">CELTIC&rsquo;S  1-0 victory over Partick Thistle  extended their lead at the top of the  Premiership table to 14 points,  with a game in hand over their nearest  rivals. Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; side  were made to work for their 16th league  win out of 17 games but their  city rivals, but Scott Sinclair&rsquo;s  first-half goal secured another  well-deserved victory.  The  Celtic manager was naturally delighted with the three points,  while  there was the added bonus of seeing Calvin Miller make his  first-team  debut.  The 18-year-old Youth Academy graduate, who has only  recently slotted  into a left-back role for the Development Squad, took  up that position  for the Glasgow derby agaist Partick Thistle. And his  performance  brought praise from his manager.  &ldquo;I thought for  18-years of age, a young player who&rsquo;s just moved  position really, he  did very well in his first game,&rdquo; the manager said.  &ldquo;That was a big  positive for us. He&rsquo;ll feel the power and the strength  needed to be a  first-team player.  &ldquo;He was up against a good opponent who was  fast and strong, and that  was the idea &ndash; put him in where it was a  test. David Amoo is quick and  strong so that was always going to be a  good test for him, but I thought  he did very, very well.&rdquo;  And  the Hoops boss drew comparisons with Ryan Bertrand, whom he  converted  from a left-winger to an England international left-back.  &ldquo;Calvin&rsquo;s  a kid that I&rsquo;ve been impressed with because he really wants  to learn,  he wants to develop,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I did a similar thing  when I was at  Chelsea with Ryan Bertrand.  &ldquo;We took Ryan from Gillingham into  Chelsea and he came in as a  left-winger in the same team as Scott  Sinclair, who was a striker. I  moved Scotty wide and put Ryan at  left-back, and Ryan went on and played  for England and won the  Champions League with Chelsea. He&#39;s now at  Southampton, and he&rsquo;s an  outstanding player.  &ldquo;And I see similar traits in Calvin where he  can do that one position  behind, but he&rsquo;s only 18 so he needs time to <br><br><h3>  From Boy Wonder to Celtic Man, Calvin Miller comes of age</h3>By Editor 9 January, 2019 No Comments<br>https://thecelticstar.com/from-boy-wonder-to-celtic-man-calvin-miller-comes-of-age/<br>CONGRATULATIONS to Celtic&rsquo;s Calvin Miller who is 21 today &ndash; Happy Birthday!<br><br>Calvin was recently re-called from his season long loan at Dundee, perhaps a sign that all is not well with Kieran Tierney&rsquo;s hip? Miller signed a contract extension at Celtic in the summer before heading to Dens Park to get some first team action under his belt.<br><br>His new contract will see Miller remain at Celtic until at least 2020.<br><br> ???? Happy 21st birthday to #CelticFC&lsquo;s @calvin_miller7 ???? pic.twitter.com/HD5ERi4zuV<br><br> &mdash; Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC) January 9, 2019<br><br>You may remember that back in 2013 Calvin was named as the Best Young Player in the World for his age group! Here is an article from Joseph Ruddy from Celticjournal.org from that year about young Calvin Miller&hellip;<br><br>Early in October (2013) an article was released which contained the details of the best youth players from around the world. It then emerged that a youth player at Celtic, Calvin Miller was one of the names in this list. Indeed Calvin was named as the best player in the world for his age!<br><br>What a remarkable achievement for any young player. This is also something that Neymar won, so to be compared with Neymar must make everyone who knows him very proud.<br><br>I&rsquo;ve taken the time to ask Calvin&rsquo;s father a few questions, which you can read below.<br><br>You&rsquo;ll no doubt be aware that Calvin has been named the world&rsquo;s best player of his age. How proud does this make you feel?<br><br>My pride for Calvin is indescribable considering what the past 12 months has provided us with, but when my phone was going crazy when it was know that Calvin was named as &ldquo;The WORLDS Best Young Footballer born in 1998&Prime; I couldn&rsquo;t speak for hours as I was fighting to hold back the emotions.<br><br>Could you tell us about Calvin? How did he get into football? When did Celtic come calling? Where does he play?<br><br>I used to take him to his Primary School games at St Bartholomew&rsquo;s in Castlemilk, he probably had about 70% of possession in these games himself. After this he was asked to join local team called Castleglen which was a year above his age group and he was a stand out yet again. That&rsquo;s probably when I started to take notice of his talent.<br><br>The coach from Castleglen was given a job with Rangers Supporters Association Boys Club and asked for Calvin who was 11 to go with him but it was U14s so coming off the bench almost each game in 8 weeks didn&rsquo;t sit well with us, so we left at end of season.<br><br>We ended up joining same team except U13s while he was still only 11 until the following year. He was instrumental in winning the League Cup, Regional Cup, Blackpool Tournament Cup and also achieving Managers Player of the year Award. He was outstanding. With this the trial for Rangers pro youth came, we went to Murray Park a few times but I pulled him out as I didn&rsquo;t think it was in his benefit as Rangers had him playing 7 a-side games because of his age, but he was at the time an out and out winger who could out run anyone and had a deadly strike so it was doing him no favours.<br><br>Along with that he was training with boys 3/4 years his senior and there was about 30 at a training session, so I said no thanks. Then after that Celtic came a-calling. His debut game for Celtic was against Rangers at Murray Park, we where getting beat one nil at half time. Calvin came on, scored a wonder goal from our own half scored and then scored the winner. Calvin plays anywhere across the front line, centre forward, left or right wing and scored 86 goals in his first season with Celtic. Not too bad eh?<br><br>What do you think the future holds for Calvin? Do you believe there&rsquo;s a successful career in football ahead for him?<br><br>I really hope there is and at the end of the day he is in the perfect position to pave a future for himself. Celtic have been amazing for his development, it&rsquo;s like an extended family and they all are looking out for Calvin&rsquo;s future. When Chris McCart gave Calvin his Celtic top with name on it when he signed his 3 year pre contract in the Celtic Board Room a few months ago I almost cried with joy! Great day, but it just goes to show you the level of detail that Celtic go to, to ensure the Celtic experience is unrivalled.<br><br>Calvin would not have been named The World&rsquo;s Best Young Footballer if it had not been Celtic. It was mentioned about 2 years ago. In a parents meeting in Celtic Park that he may change positions from striker to a Gareth Bale type player, and that was before Gareth became the world&rsquo;s most expensive player, so I&rsquo;m hoping Celtic&rsquo;s vision comes true. On a serious note, I just hope that Calvin can make a great living doing what he loves best and if he can do that at a club we both love then I am sure he will become a legend!<br><br>Have Celtic helped in relation to his development and all-round play? Does training fit in well with an education?<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s youth development programme at Lennoxtown has been inspirational in Calvin&rsquo;s progress. He gets picked up and dropped off daily and wants for nothing. He gets all the support physically and mentally he needs. Celtic have became a part of his life and it doesn&rsquo;t stop at his team coach, it&rsquo;s every age group coach, physio, scout&hellip;the list goes on. Calvin now goes to school once a week (on a Wednesday) as he is full time with Celtic which Celtic are insistent of to ensure Calvin gets an education on the back of being a full time footballer. When he was at school full time we could not ask for more from St. Ninian&rsquo;s in Kirkie as they enhanced his expected exam results!<br><br>How often do you get to go along and watch Calvin playing for Celtic?<br><br>I try and got to all home games in Lennoxtown, although as I don&rsquo;t drive that seems like an away game for me. If Calvin kicks off at 3pm on a Sunday then I need to leave about 12:15 to get a connecting bus to Lennoxtown as they are every hour. When Calvin was younger I took Calvin to every training session and every game but that was when it was in Glasgow. Changing shifts at work was possible then but as its so far away it&rsquo;s difficult.<br><br>My weekends do consist of going to Calvin&rsquo;s games on a Sunday and his younger brother Kyle&rsquo;s games on a Saturday. Then I have the occasional midweek game with Calvin in the Glasgow Cup. I also follow Calvin to every Scotland game, I went all of last year&rsquo;s Victory Shields games, the Italy game and a few more. I am off tomorrow with Calvin&rsquo;s brothers Kyle and Oliver and my partner to N.Ireland to watch Calvin again in the Victory Shield.<br><br>Imagine Calvin&rsquo;s name on the Celtic first team starting line-up. How would that make you feel?<br><br>As my own father was a Celtic fan and as I am to see my own flesh and blood pull on the hoops top on at Paradise would be THE biggest moment in my life.  </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><h3>  MILLER&rsquo;S EMOTIONAL FAREWELL</h3>https://www.celticquicknews.co.uk/millers-emotional-farewell/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<br>By CQN Magazine on 27th May 2020 Latest News<br><br>CALVIN MILLER confirmed his exit from Celtic with an emotional farewell on Twitter.<br><br>The 22-year-old left-back had been at Parkhead for 10 years after kicking off in the youth set-up.<br><br>Miller&rsquo;s Hoops contract was extended in 2016 and made his debut against Partick Thistle during Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; first year in charge.<br><br>However, he made only five top-side appearances and had loan spells at Dundee and Ayr United. The one-time Scotland Under-21 utility player was forced to undergo surgery after sustaining an injury in an academy game against Hibs in September last year, as CQN reported.<br><br>Miller was linked with Kilmarnock before international defender Greg Taylor&rsquo;s &pound;2.25million deadline day move to Parkhead on September 2.<br><br>The youngster, from the Castlemilk housing estate in Glasgow, fell behind the likes of Taylor, Boli Bolingoli and Jonny Hayes in his battle for a place in the first-team squad.<br><br>Miller is out of contract next month, but has officially confirmed his exit from his boyhood favourites as he said farewell to his team-mates and supporters.<br><br>He wrote: &ldquo;10 years of unbelievable memories and friends for life and been lucky enough to live my dream so young playing such a short part in a incredible team.<br><br>&ldquo;Unfortunately all good things come to an end at some point but it&rsquo;s time to take the next step in my career, cheers to everyone.&rdquo;  </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><h3>  Calvin Miller praises Brendan Rodgers following Celtic exit</h3>By Lubo98 3 June, 2020 <br>https://thecelticstar.com/calvin-miller-praises-brendan-rodgers-following-celtic-exit/<br><br>CALVIN MILLER has opened up on his Celtic exit and his career so far &ndash; praising former manager Brendan Rodgers. The 22-year-old had been at Celtic for over a decade but news last week confirmed that he would be departing at the end of his contract.<br><br>Speaking to the Scottish Sun, Miller spoke about how tough it was having to leave the club but that he will keep in touch, having departed with great memories of his time with the Scottish Champions. Miller admitted that he thought leaving was inevitable after Brendan Rodgers left the club.<br><br>&ldquo;Celtic was all I knew. I supported the club then signed for them when I was 12.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been my life for ten years and I&rsquo;ve been lucky to get the contracts to stay as long as I have. I&rsquo;m sad to be leaving and I&rsquo;ve got amazing memories.<br><br>&ldquo;I know a lot of the coaches and I&rsquo;ve spoken to them all.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not been able to say a proper goodbye by shaking hands at Lennoxtown but it won&rsquo;t be a goodbye because I&rsquo;ll keep in touch with them.<br>&ldquo;I sort of knew leaving was on the cards. Last August I&rsquo;d come back from my loan at Ayr by which time Brendan Rodgers had left.<br>&ldquo;Under Neil Lennon I got the vibe, because teams were getting made in training and I wasn&rsquo;t in his plans.&rdquo;<br><br>Miller heaped praise on Brendan Rodgers, the manager who gave the versatile wide player his debut. Miller made his bow in a home win over Partick Thistle in Rodgers&rsquo; first season at the Scottish Champions and Miller went on to make four more appearances in between loan spells.<br><br>&ldquo;When Brendan came in he was incredible with me. He made me a better player and I learned something every day.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d still say I&rsquo;m a winger. When Brendan wanted me in his team you&rsquo;d be left-back but because he was so dominant in possession it was like being a winger.<br><br>&ldquo;It was just a case of how attacking the team was. If any manager asked me to play there again I wouldn&rsquo;t say no. I&rsquo;d do it for the team.<br><br>&ldquo;My debut was a surreal moment. There was the noise and the huddle.&rdquo;<br><br>Rodgers had attempted to use Miller as a left wingback, providing competition for Kieran Tierney, similar to what the Irishman did with Ryan Bertrand at Chelsea. Miller isn&rsquo;t one for looking back in anger at his time at Celtic but he did consider the &lsquo;what if&rsquo; question of what might have his career have been had Brendan Rodgers not left the club.<br>&ldquo;If Brendan had still been there then who knows what might have happened. But people move on.<br>&ldquo;He suited my style and I suited his style.&rdquo;<br><br>Despite leaving his boyhood team, Miller holds no grudges against Celtic for departing after a decade at the club. Miller instead is proud of the part that he has played at Celtic, being involved in 9-in-a-row as well as the Double Treble celebrations.<br><br>&ldquo;I was happy with what I did and I don&rsquo;t have any regrets. The ten years went so quickly. These moments pass by so fast so you have to live them when it happens.<br><br>&ldquo;Being in amongst the Double Treble and on the bus after the Cup final then celebrating in front of the fans at Celtic Park are moments I&rsquo;ll never forget.<br>&ldquo;To even play a small part in nine in a row, I should be more than happy with that.&rdquo;<br><br>Miller will now recover from that ACL injury as he looks to get a new contract upon recovery. The 22-year-old still has plenty of time to make a good career for himself and he has been unfortunate with injuries, stunting his opportunities to make himself a first team regular.<br><br>Hopefully Miller is able to showcase the talents that he possesses and one day make his way back to Celtic Park.  </div><br></div>
