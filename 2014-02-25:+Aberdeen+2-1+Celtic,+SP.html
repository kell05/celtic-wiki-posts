So will test the old MoN v WGS arguments from the forums, or better still we hope not. <br></li><li>Martin O&rsquo;Neill has admitted that he is looking forward to the prospect of taking his side to Celtic Park.

Stokes did better in the 2nd half, but thats only because  Aberdeen were sitting in to protect their lead.<br><br>A wonder goal to  beat Forsters record, but with 10 men and the aforementioned Commons and  Stokes not tracking, there was a huge gap in midfield for Hayes to run  through. 2nd goal just before half time killed it.<br><br>Dominated the  2nd half, but they were determined just to sit in and hit us on the  counter and we didnt have enough ideas to get through them.<br><br>Forrest provided a much needed bit of pace and spark and took his goal well.<br><br>Denied a stonewall penalty, but there wasnt a break in play between that and Forrests goal, so its possibly moot to mention it.<br><br>Brown  has to be the worst decision maker in the history of football. 10  minutes to go, we get a free kick in Mulgrew territory on the edge of  the box and he plays a quick, short pass and gives it away. <br><br>No  idea why Samaras was brought on. Him and Boerrigter were only warming  up for the first 10 minutes of the second half then no other sub was out  until Lennon sent Balde out to warm up after 9.25pm. Why? Far too late  to make any sort of impact.<br><br>Biton was fantastic, and Griffiths put in the sort of shift you need when down to 10 men. 						 						 						<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Aberdeen</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Langfield         </li><li>    29  Logan      (Anderson - 83&#39;  )  </li><li>    05  Considine   Booked      </li><li>    15  Robson         </li><li>    28  Tate      (Shaughnessy - 83&#39;  )  </li><li>    06  Reynolds         </li><li>    10  McGinn         </li><li>    08  Flood   Booked      </li><li>    17  Rooney         </li><li>    16  Pawlett      (Vernon - 92&#39;  )  </li><li>    11  Hayes         </li></ul> Substitutes <ul class="subs-list"><li>    02  Shaughnessy       </li><li>    04  Anderson       </li><li>    07  Zola       </li><li>    09  Vernon       </li><li>    14  Smith       </li><li>    18  Low       </li><li>    20  Weaver       </li></ul>Goals<ul><li>Hayes 41&prime; <br></li><li>Rooney 45&prime; <br></li></ul>  </div> <div class="away-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Forster         </li><li>    02  Matthews         </li><li>    03  Izaguirre      (Balde - 89&#39;  )  </li><li>    06  Biton         </li><li>    04  Ambrose Emuobo   Booked      </li><li>    05  van Dijk   Dismissed      </li><li>    08  Brown         </li><li>    15  Commons      (Forrest - 45&#39;  )  </li><li>    28  Griffiths   Booked   (Samaras - 77&#39;  )  </li><li>    10  Stokes         </li><li>    21  Mulgrew         </li></ul> Substitutes <ul class="subs-list"><li>    09  Samaras       </li><li>    11  Boerrigter       </li><li>    17  Balde       </li><li>    20  Pukki       </li><li>    24  Zaluska       </li><li>    41  Fisher       </li><li>    49  Forrest       </li></ul>Goals<ul><li>Forrest 62&prime; <br></li></ul>  </div>  <div class="additional">  <div class="referee"> Ref: Craig Thomson </div>   <div class="attendance"> Att: 16,634</div></div></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  Match Report (see end of page below)</li><li class="MsoNormal">Audio Report: Paradise Report<br></li></ul>  <h3>  Pictures </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a href="/page/2014-02-25%3A+Aberdeen+2-1+Celtic%2C+SP+-+Pictures" target="_self">Match Pictures</a></li></ul><h3>MOTM</h3> <ul><li>Voting Thread<br>   </li><li>Result Thread</li><li>Winner - <br></li><li><a href="/page/KDS+MOTM+Winners+2013%2F14" target="_self">2013-14 Winners</a></li></ul>     <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Stats</h3>  <b>Aberdeen Celtic</b><br><b>Possession</b><br>48% 52%<br>90mins <br><br><b>Shots</b><br>8 10<br><br><b>On target</b><br>4 5<br><br><b>Corners</b><br>3 5<br><br><b>Fouls</b><br>13 13  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3>  Aberdeen end Celtic&rsquo;s bid for unbeaten season<br>The Scotsman<br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/latest/aberdeen-end-celtic-s-bid-for-unbeaten-season-1-3320119<br><br> by ALAN PATTULLO AT PITTODRIE<br><br>Updated on the 26 February<br>2014 08:45<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s hopes of completing the season unbeaten in the league perished at Pittodrie last night on a special night for Aberdeen, who clinched their second victory over the Parkhead side inside a month.<br><br>It is also the first time in over 20 years that Aberdeen have beaten Celtic both home and away in the same season. Already eliminated from both cup competitions, Celtic manager Neil Lennon had challenged his side to show they were &ldquo;invincible&rdquo; in the league. However, they could not overcome the red card shown to Virgil Van Dijk after only 11 minutes and conceded two goals in the five period before half-time. Goalkeeper Fraser Forster surrendered his clean sheets record after 1255 minutes of league football while Celtic&rsquo;s 26-match unbeaten run in the league was also undone at Pittodrie, in front of a crowd of over 16,000.<br><br>Jonny Hayes&rsquo; thunderous effort from 30 yards after 40 minutes finally broke Forster&rsquo;s long run without conceding a goal in the league and Adam Rooney added a second soon afterwards. Substitute James Forrest pulled one back for ten man Celtic and Lennon described their efforts to get back into the game as &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo;. This was not a word he used in connection with referee Craig Thomson, who infuriated the manager with his decision to send off Van Dijk for a last-ditch foul on Peter Pawlett and also his refused to award Celtic a penalty in the second half for what Lennon felt was a handball by Mark Reynolds. &ldquo;I thought we were worthy of the win,&rdquo; said Lennon. &ldquo;I thought we deserved it. The referee ruined the game &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a sending-off. Pawlett&rsquo;s going across the goal rather than towards the goal and I&rsquo;m pretty sure [Efe] Ambrose was getting across. There was a clear handball in the second-half. He has seen it and said it wasn&rsquo;t deliberate. Everyone else in the ground must have known it was a penalty. He&rsquo;s had two crucial decisions go against us.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the red card back,&rdquo; Lennon continued. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think it was a red card at the time and I still don&rsquo;t. I spoke to the referee briefly after the game, on the pitch. He didn&rsquo;t give an explanation &ndash; he just said he understood I was upset and left it at that. I think it&rsquo;s poor. Maybe I&rsquo;m the only one who sees it that way but I&rsquo;m pretty convinced it&rsquo;s not a red card<br><br>&ldquo;I thought we were outstanding,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;The first goal you can hold your hand up and say it was a great hit. You don&rsquo;t mind that &ndash; it&rsquo;s going to take a special goal to beat Fraser. The second goal is disappointing from our point of view but I thought we were magnificent in the second half and I expect that from these players.&rdquo;<br><br>Derek McInnes saluted his Aberdeen team, who bounced back from Saturday 3-1 defeat to Partick Thistle to record another win over Celtic after their Scottish Cup fifth round triumph.<br><br>&ldquo;I am delighted with every one of the players, it is a good night for the club,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You saw Pittodrie at its best tonight. The supporters were really energised and got behind the team. It was a big, big turn out and it was important that they saw the team win tonight.<br><br>McInnes thanked the fans for &ldquo;not getting as anxious as we were&rdquo; during the second-half comeback from ten man Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;They have seen their team beat Celtic deservedly with two magnificent goals and loads of effort,&rdquo; he said. It is not easy to beat Celtic whether they have ten or 11 men. You can see why these players play for Celtic. They never know when they are beaten.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;It was a bit disappointing we never kept the ball better in the second half. It added to the anxiety in the ground. But, over the 90 minutes, we were the better team. It was the right decision to send Van Dijk off. It is a big ask to beat Celtic because they are proud of their unbeaten run.&rdquo;<br><br>In last night&rsquo;s two other Premiership games, Inverness Caledonian Thistle enjoyed a fine 3-0 away derby win over Ross County and St Johnstone comfortably beat Motherwell 3-0 at McDiarmid Park.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>By Andrew Southwick BBC Scotland<br><br>Aberdeen inflicted a first league defeat of the season on Celtic with their second victory over the champions in a matter of weeks.<br><br>Celtic had Virgil van Dijk sent off for a last-man challenge on Peter Pawlett after just 12 minutes.<br><br>Jonathan Hayes&#39;s shot flew into the top corner to give Aberdeen the lead, before Adam Rooney headed in a second.<br><br>Substitute James Forrest gave Celtic a lifeline to make it a nervy second half, but the Dons held on.<br><br>With Celtic&#39;s 26-game unbeaten run went Fraser Forster&#39;s clean sheet record, and the last five goals the English goalkeeper has now conceded domestically have been to Derek McInnes&#39;s men.<br><br>The Dons&#39; victory follows their win in Glasgow when they knocked holders Celtic out of the Scottish Cup.<br><br>With Motherwell losing to St Johnstone, the Dons now move four points clear in second spot in the Scottish Premiership as they close in on Europa League qualification.<br>Forster&#39;s record<br><br>Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster&#39;s Scottish record for the longest time without conceding a league goal was an unbroken 1,215 minutes coming into the game - it was ended at 1,256 minutes.<br><br>Celtic had not let in a Scottish Premiership goal since they last played Aberdeen, in a 3-1 win back on 23 November.<br><br>Celtic started the game on the front foot and twice had Aberdeen living dangerously inside the opening minutes.<br><br>Ex-Don Charlie Mulgrew slipped inside his marker and drilled a low ball at Jamie Langfield, before Anthony Stokes almost scrambled Scott Brown&#39;s low cross over the line, only for Mark Reynolds to make a timely intervention.<br><br>It was a good start from the visitors, but manager Neil Lennon&#39;s game plan was turned on its head inside the first quarter of an hour.<br><br>Mulgrew gifted away possession, leaving Van Dijk the last man against two red shirts.
