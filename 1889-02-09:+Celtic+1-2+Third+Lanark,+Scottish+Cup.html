The game was played at the first Hampden Park and Scotland included Andrew Watson, the world&rsquo;s first black international footballer, in their line-up. The pavilion is now used as the clubhouse for the Hampden Bowling Club which sits where the ground built in 1873 used to be.

The match all through was most stubbornly contested, but the superior combination of the Third told, and to this their success may on large measure be attributed. The 3rd lodged a protest against the finding of the Association at their last meeting, and also on account of the state of the ground, but having won the match these objections fell to the ground. The gate and stand money amounted to &pound;900. The teams turned out to the minute, both being received with enthusiasm by their supporters.<br>The Third won the toss, and played with the wind and sun at their backs. Play soon raged fast and furious, and an early visit was paid by the Third to their opponents&rsquo; quarters. The ball was sent past, and Tom Maley, aided by his brilliant speed, made for the Third&rsquo;s goal. Thomson defended superbly, but another goal run by Maley enabled McCallum to send the ball through, but, as the referee&rsquo;s whistle had previously blown, the point was of no value.<br>After this narrow escape, the Volunteers replied, with telling effect, Marshall, after a clever run, all but capturing Kelly&rsquo;s charge. A corner fell to the Volunteers, but Groves fixed on the ball and ran it the whole length of the field amid the greatest enthusiasm. Tom Maley received the ball from the Celtic crack, but missed a remarkable easy chance. It was now the turn of the Volunteers, grand combination in front carrying the ball past all opposition, but Kelly proved a successful custodian, repelling all attacks. Thomson, however, missed with the goal at his mercy.<br>The game was proceeding on fast and open lines, and was thoroughly enjoyable from a spectator&rsquo;s point of view. Groves, and then McCallum, might with luck have scored but they invariably met with a stubborn defence from Auld and Thomson. A foul at the Celts&rsquo; goal caused their supporters much uneasiness and amid a scene of indescribable excitement the ball was sent through, the Third thus scoring twenty-five minutes from the start.<br>This roused the Celtic to renewed efforts, Groves and Maley initiating a beautiful run, but McCallum&rsquo;s shooting was at fault. The Third had an open goal at their mercy, and how the Celt&rsquo;s escaped was a mystery. The Volunteers still kept up the pressure, the &ldquo;green and white stripes&rdquo; not having settled down to their usual play. The latter defence was thus severely tested.<br>At half-time the Third led one goal to nothing.<br>The game was soon restarted. The Celts kept their adversaries busy. The combination seemed more effective than in the first period, with the result that Downie&rsquo;s abilities were much tried. Hannah, after some clever work, sent in a stinging shot, which Kelly caught and threw out in a wonderful fashion. After this near share the Celts redoubled their efforts, and Groves gave McCallum a grand opportunity, which he again failed to take advantage of. A foul against the Volunteers further assisted the Celtic, but McFarlane and Auld were impassable. The Celts kept their opponents continually on the defensive for some time, and a rare shot from McLaren all but took effect.<br>The ball principally aided by T. Maley, was taken to the Volunteer goal, and McCallum equalised amidst a scene which simply baffles description. This put new life into Celtic, the whole team playing as one man, McKeown being cheered over and over again for his superb kicking. The Celts continued to hem their opponents within their territories and a continual bombardment was kept up to Downie. The Irish form, compared with the beginning of the game, was simply astounding. Try as they liked, however, they could not increase their score.<br>The Third, on the other hand, by some excellent passing, carried the play in front of Kelly and Oswald sent the ball through amid wild excitement. This unexpected reverse seemed to chill the ardour of the Celtic players, and their prospects of success with time close at hand looked gloomy indeed. This proved correct, and when Mr Campbell blew his whistle the Volunteers had secured the Cup.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Report 2</h3>The interest in the protested final tie for the Scottish Cup played between the 3rd LRV and the Celtic on Hampden Park Saturday was as great as on the previous week. There were fully as many spectators present. It is estimated that there were fully 18,000 persons within the enclosure, and the money taken at the gates and the stands is believed to have slightly exceeded the previous Saturday, when &pound;920 was realised.<br>The decision of the Association in ordering the tie to be replayed caused a good deal of comment during the week. We have it, however, on the best authority that previous to the teams stepping on the field the officials, owing to the state of the ground, gave instructions to play the tie under protest, which was done.<br>The protest came up for discussion in the ordinary way, and after hearing the evidence of the referee and the umpires, who all agreed in stating that the ground was unplayable, the committee unanimously decided to have the tie replayed, and, in the circumstances, it was the only decision that could have been arrived at.<br>Regarding Saturday&rsquo;s game, it was one of the finest displays of football witnessed for many years. The ground was in fairly good condition &ndash; perhaps just a trifle too hard &ndash; but quite playable. The weather, too, was excellent, and everything favoured a keen contest. The 3rd LRV won the toss, and chose to play, like their opponents last week, with the wind at their backs. The consequence was that during the first half they had the most of the play, if we except one or two magnificent runs by the Celts. But they only succeeded in scoring one goal, and that out of a scrimmage.<br>It is true that their efforts deserved more success, but they had just a similar experience to what the Celts had last week, luck being all against them.<br>In the second period the Celts early put on the pressure, and equalised the score after 22 minutes, McCallum heading the ball through. After this the Irishmen looked the winners all the way over, as they seldom allowed the Third to get away.<br>Towards the close, however, the Volunteers, by fine combined passing, got down the whole length of the field, and scored the winning point. Individually, the Celts showed the most brilliant form, McKeown, Kelly, McLaren, and McCallum being most prominent, although Groves had occasionally some splendid runs all by himself. McKeown&rsquo;s clean and strong kicking reminded one of Arnott and Forbes at their best. He also tackled splendidly, and deprived an opponent of the ball in easier fashion than any other man on the field.<br>Kelly fairly surpassed himself, while McLaren played in his usual cool and effective style. Kelly in goal did good work for his side, while W Maley is fast improving as a half-back.<br>The whole of the Third&rsquo;s forwards played in good combined form, and it is in this respect probably that they had the advantage over their opponents. They were more effective in front of goal. Their backs also showed strong defence, Auld in particular doing some grand work.<br>Previous to the game beginning the Volunteers lodged a protest against playing on the hard ground, and also against the decision of the Association Committee. Now that they have won the cup &ndash; and we are sure no one will grudge them the honour &ndash; the protest fortunately will not have to be considered.<br>The Celtic are a young club, and are to be congratulated upon having entered the final in the first year of their existence.<br>The 3rd LRV and the Celtic played their protested tie for the Scottish Cup on Hampden Park. The weather although cold, was favourable for a good display of football, and the interest taken in the game is indicated by the fact that there were as many spectators present as last week, when it was calculated that between 18,000 and 20,000 were within the enclosure.<br>Before beginning the match the 3rd LRV handed the referee (Mr Charles Campbell) a protest against the hardness of the ground, and also against the decision of the Association, in ordering the tie to be replayed.<br>The Third won the toss, and chose to play with a slight breeze at their backs. Groves sent the ball in motion for the Celts at 3.27. The Volunteers, however, got away on the right by some pretty passing, but the ball was ultimately sent behind.<br>On the kick-off the Celts began a good, combined run, but Auld came to the rescue, and relieved splendidly. Immediately afterwards the Celts, by a pretty bit of passing, got clean away, and McCallum sent the ball through. The goal was disallowed, however, as the whistle had blown previously for off-side.<br>The Third at once retaliated, and had a run the whole length of the field, forcing the Celts to concede a corner. Marshall took the kick, but sent the ball past the posts, to the disgust of the Third&rsquo;s supporters. So far the game was pretty even, both sides having runs and counter runs. The backs of both teams, however, saved splendidly. <br>After this Groves began a phenomenal run., he carried the ball almost the whole length of the field, and when near goal passed across to Maley, who however, was tackled by Thomson. The Celt&rsquo;s centre forward was loudly cheered for a magnificent piece of play. After this Coleman, of the Celts, was injured, and had to retire from the field.<br>The Third now caused some uneasiness to the Celts, as they crowded round the latter&rsquo;s goal, and on several occasions they narrowly escaped scoring, the ball being ultimately sent past. The Celts again began another good run, and McCallum shot for goal, when the ball just struck the post and went behind.<br>The Third, however, would have no denial, and certainly pressed hard. Oswald had a grand chance to score, but shot wide of the mark, and immediately afterwards another opportunity was spoiled. Some fine play was now witnessed at the Third&rsquo;s goal. Auld headed out the ball, but it was shot back when Coleman &ndash; who had returned &ndash; shot wide.<br>The Third again looked dangerous, as Johnston and Hannah carried the ball right up the field and got close through a miskick by Gallagher. An exciting game was afterwards witnessed in front of the Celts&lsquo; goal. A foul was given against the Celts just at their gaol. The ball was beautifully placed, and a scrimmage earned.<br>Marshall sent the ball into goal, when Kelly caught it and threw it out, but a shout was raised that a goal had been scored. Although the game continued for a second or two the Third claimed the point, urging that the ball was through when Kelly caught it, and Mr Campbell, referee, after consulting with each of the umpires, gave the first goal for the Third. This was twenty-three minutes from the start.<br>The Celts, after being hemmed in for a considerable time, now brought the ball down the field by the prettiest passing of the day. Maley began by sending the ball to Groves, and the whole forwards came away at once until McCallum found an opening, but sent the ball wide of the mark.<br>The Third then assumed the aggressive, and two good shots were sent in, which looked like coming off, but did not. The game was keenly contested, but there was no further scoring and when half-time was called the score stood &ndash; 3rd LRV, 1 goal; Celtic, 0 goals.<br>On the game being resumed the Third got away, but Gallagher returned the ball, and play was brought well into the Third&rsquo;s territory, when a sort of scrimmage took place in front of goal, the ball being ultimately sent behind. The Celtic again returned to the attack and a grand shot was sent in from the right, but Downie kicked out just in the nick of time.<br>The Third made praiseworthy efforts to get away, and got well down the field, but Kelly came in the way. The Celts were now having more of the play than their opponents, and looked like scoring when the ball was sent over the bar. The Celts continued to put on the pressure, but when it came to the crucial point they were usually found wanting.<br>Several times they had the goal at their mercy, but they could not get the ball through.<br>Success, however, was to come. But they fought for 22 minutes before their reward came. The whole of the forwards crowded round the goal, and McCallum coming up in time headed the ball neatly through the goal. The enthusiasm was intense. The Celt&rsquo;s supporters were greatly elated at the victory, and all round the vast assemblage a vigorous shout went up. The prospects of the game now looked somewhat in favour of the Celts, as they still continued to keep up the pressure, and Groves looked like scoring.<br>The Third, however, tried hard to get away, and would have been successful but for the grand play of McKeown and Kelly. The Celts kept at it, but as in the case when the 3rd Lanark scored their first goal last Saturday, they broke away, and through excellent combined passing brought the ball to within a few yards of the Celts&rsquo; goal, when Oswald rushed in, and amidst the greatest excitement scored what proved to be the winning point for the Volunteers.<br>The game was now over, but the Celts persevered, although to no purpose, the remainder of the game consisting in alternate runs, and when the whistle blew the 3rd LRD were the winners<br>Result &ndash; 3rd LRV, 2 goals; Celtic, 1 goal  <br><br><img align="bottom" alt="[Untitled]" height="1343" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/a250d6d300cacb45f88b56ebcc4fad64/GW684H1343" title="[Untitled]" width="684"><br></div></div>
