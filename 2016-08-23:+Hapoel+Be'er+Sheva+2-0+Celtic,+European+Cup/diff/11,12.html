For the first time, Rodgers  seemed to get so much wrong, be it his substitutions, his tactics,  formation and preparation. Can&#39;t believe it was the same Celtic who  smashed Hapoel 5-2 last week and possibly should have been by more. <br><br>In many ways  Hapoel have the right to feel they should have won by the three goal  margin they required, with an incredible number of chances in that game  (including a cracking overhead kick which was fortunate for us to go  wide). <br><br>Celtic&#39;s only  real chances were by Sinclair and Dembele. We were mince, and struggled  to string passes together or even keep possession. Every 50 50 was won  by them. <br><br>How did Janko  remain on the pitch? He was poor, and conceded a penalty (which really shouldn&#39;t have been given, it was a free kick). He wasn&#39;t fully responsible for the  second goal lost which was calamitous but he and Gordon really need to  have a good look at themselves. A cross in by HSB, Gordon grabs it, Janko runs into him due to momentum, Gordon spills it and a HSB players snatches the ball and kicks it into the net. Shambles. Gordon should have been stronger in holding the goal and commanding his area, but it capped a dreadful game by Janko with all stating he should have been off.<br><br>Overall a shambles and yet we squeaked through, with clock watching galore as the nervous support counted down every second, and it was often better to watch than the worrying fare on the pitch. In fairness, Hapoel were not great but they made enough chances to win the whole playoffs.<br><br>Rodgers first truly poor game <span class="diffRemove">(even</span><span class="diffAdd">(poorer</span> <span class="diffRemove">worse </span>performance <span class="diffAdd">for large parts </span>incredibly than Lincoln Red Imps game). A lot to learn from. </div></div></div><br><br>(Lbhoy of KDS)<br>I thought BR got it wrong initially tonight.<br><br>Janko instead of Lustig (hmmm) ...McGregor instead of Rogic.... (nono) <br><br>I&#39;m  guessing his plan was to press high up and pick up the second ball  letting our midfield collect pass and build from there. Flaw was no  Rogic. We didn&#39;t have anyone , unlike last week, that wanted to put  their foot on the ball and try and build and use Sinclair and Forrest.<br><br>Watching Janko and Forrest down the RHS was excruciating...at one point Janko was closing down their LB in their box...wtf!!!<br><br>Should  have switched McGregor for Rogic he was an empty jersey...not breve  enough tonight...he is ok when we dominate but passenger when under  pressure.<br><br>Fair play though to BR going 3 at the back looked much  more compact then and although not comfortable looked as if we we had  good shape and protection.<br><br>I thought they were a poor team especially tonight, set piece and a fluke goal they offered little much else quality wise.<br><br>We  are in the Champions League though and that&#39;s all that matters. We  won&#39;t play that badly again...different scenario when it&#39;s points to  play for in group rather than protecting a 1st leg lead.<br><br>What have we learned?....we are going to have shampoo loads of CL revenue and Janko should never wear a Celtic jersey again ..  <br><br>Bring on Madrid!!!!!! <br><br>(Brazilbhoy of KDS)<br>BR must have his moments wi this lot. I assume Janko and McGregor  must be spectacular in training cos the obvious  was  demonstrated, McGregor  is lightweight especially  when we needed a solid game managing midfielder. That he is not. Rogic was the obvious  choice - <br>Janko  just follows in a string  of defenders who canny defend, surely  to God  he will not be seen again, both he and Effe are <br>bomb scares, the are almost paralysed with fear at times, the nerves were jailing every time he faced an attacker in full flight.<br>My problem with Celtic is that we rarely match teams who are no better than us but play with a determination and spirit which we canny cope with.We make them look good and we display a fear that should not be there. <br>The Israelis are tough. The pressed  the ball all the time, they marked tightly and had a knack of continually fouling to get at the ball, going through players from the back yet draw few free kicks. I lost count of the headers/50/50 we came out without the ball.At set pieces we are all over the place.<br>In short we lack organisation and technique to play against the tough, well organised teams, even here in Scotland. We are miles  ahead of others in the SPL in football style but this is not the SPL, this is Europe, watching RMadrid and Man City hunt the man with the ball ruthlessly we stand off players and give them space and  freedom to run.<br>Celtics future in Europe will not be determined by brilliance but by our ability to be solid and match other teams in sheer determination. If you are puzzled why the Israelis got through their qualifiers you would see why last night.<br>To pick out one player for instance,  he was a standout  in both games, the big baldy African no. 9. He was fabulous. We just couldn&#39;t get the ball off him, good footballer but terrific at using his weight to shrug of players as if they weren&#39;t there.<br>BR should have had him man marked all game - he must have known he was brilliant from that first game . Maybe Janko was supposed  to  do  this. If he was, he simply wasn&#39;t up to it. This is a player Celtic could sign right away,he will be cup tied but he would be sensational in our squad, he has everything we need.<br>I am not going to criticise Gordon, he usually has little to do but he has come unstuck more  than once on big occasions but his defence offer him no cover and he seems to have no authority in his 6 yard box, this has been obvious  before in testing games. This badly needs addressed.<br>Relief more than anything else last night. We were  piss poor overall, but we survived. Rogers will, from here on in be judged on his ability to address the years old weaknesses in defence and general commitment from players who are pretty average but turn into chocolate soldiers on the big occasions. The Rangers cup semi is still fresh  In my mind, we still aren&#39;t  tough enough or committed enough to compete with the teams who have lesser ability but heaps of attitude - the scrappers of this world.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Teams</font></h3><br><div class="tab-selector__tab-panel-content"><div><div class="gel-layout"><div class="gel-layout__item gel-bp-s-1/2 gel-1/2@s"><h3 class="gel-mb gel-great-primer-bold">Hapoel Be&#39;er Sheva</h3><ul class="list-ui list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="list-ui__item">1Goresh</li><li class="list-ui__item">2Bitton</li><li class="list-ui__item">4Leonardo V&iacute;tor Substituted for Shabtay at 76&#39;minutes<i> Booked at 90mins</i></li><li class="list-ui__item">5Tzedek</li><li class="list-ui__item">13Davidzada</li><li class="list-ui__item">7Radi</li><li class="list-ui__item">30Ogu</li><li class="list-ui__item">12Hoban</li><li class="list-ui__item">24Melikson Substituted for Bar Buzaglo at 34&#39;minutes</li><li class="list-ui__item">22Palhano Soares Substituted for Sahar at 19&#39;minutes</li><li class="list-ui__item">9Nwakaeme</li></ul>Substitutes<ul class="list-ui list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="list-ui__item">11Bar Buzaglo</li><li class="list-ui__item">14Sahar</li><li class="list-ui__item">15Brown</li><li class="list-ui__item">17Ohayon</li><li class="list-ui__item">20Taha</li><li class="list-ui__item">21Shabtay</li><li class="list-ui__item">55Haimov</li></ul>Goals<ul><li>Sahar (21&#39;

It was the ghost of away European games of the past come back to haunt the Northern Irishman who had nothing to do with previous games. Hapoel scored twice, missed plenty of chances, including a penalty, and will feel aggrieved.<br><br>And yet what is it they say? That football is all about results and this aggregate win is as important to the club as any in a long time came fittingly in &lsquo;The Land of Milk and Honey&rsquo; because that is precisely what the group stages of the world&rsquo;s most lucrative football competition are to the clubs involved.<br><br>Celtic could earn as much as &pound;30million over the next few months, enough to sew up the domestic scene for many years, or so you would imagine, and it will allow Rodgers to go shopping in more expensive boutiques.<br><br>But once again the Celtic fans were made to suffer. They watched their team outplayed here. That 5-2 lead was under threat for so long and by the end the Scottish champions were hanging on as never before.<br><br>At least they are there. But there were quite a few found lacking. Rodgers needs to get in at least two more first-teamers or the group stages may be punishing.<br><br>Success, of course, at this level is never easy. From the start it was clear Hapoel had not given up hope. A minute had gone when James Forrest was outmuscled on the touchline by Ofir Davidzada, the ball was picked up by Ovidiu Hoban whose curling shot gave Craig Gordon his first piece of work for the evening.<br><br>And then after quarter of an hour the first glimpse of what was to become a long night for the Celtic defence.<br><br>Saido Janko has never convinced and the right back stuck out a leg and got nowhere near the ball as he tripped Davidzada just inside the box. Dutch referee Bas Nijhuis pointed to the spot, Maharan Raid went for power from 12 yards and Gordon guessed right and got his body behind the ball.<br><br>That blessed relief for Celtic lasted until the 21st minute when the old failings reappeared as a simple corner was not dealt with. Raid floated a ball into the six yard box and substitute Ben Sahar found it far too easy to get up and head the ball home.<br><br>There were quite a few players from the visitors who looked uncomfortable, no more than Janko who was all over the place. Hapoel are not brilliant but they can pass the ball and were finding so much space when last week there was none.<br><br>At least Griffiths got a shot on target after 33 minutes, the first time the ball had spent any time in the Israeli&rsquo;s half. Then Janko to be his credit made a good run from deep and for once put his cross into the box where Sinclair got the ball but his effort was tame.  <br><br>   After some decent Hapoel pressure, the impressive Anthony Nwakaeme  tested Gordon with a shot from outside the area, and then Celtic broke  on 38 minutes, the ball was played from Sinclair, Griffiths, McGregor  and eventually to Forrest who put his shot from close in over when a  cross was the better option. <br><br>   Rodgers would have welcomed half-time. Many of his players needed a  not-so-gentle reminder what was at stake and that they had to up their  games. Forrest was replaced by Tom Rogic. Janko stayed on and three  minutes into the half was partly to blame for the second goal. <br><br>   A nothing ball into the Celtic box should have been dealt with by  Gordon who inexplicably allowed it to bounce, Janko barged into him, the  ball got loose, Hoban said thanks very much and scored from close  range. It was an excruciating moment for both defender and goalkeeper <br><br>   Now what did Celtic have? It looked at this stage as if many had gone.  They couldn&rsquo;t pass or make a tackle. Rodgers understandably wore the  look of a man who didn&rsquo;t quite believe what was going on in front of  him. <br><br>   Moussa Dembele replaced the knackered Griffiths and on the hour the  Frenchman cut in from the left and sent his curled shot a coat of paint  wide of the post. Celtic nearly scored again four minutes later when  Rogic did well to get a past a few tackles on the edge of the box, the  ball broke to Sinclair who got off a shot, which was well save by David  Goresh, and Dembele was in an offside position when he missed the  rebound. Sinclair really should have done better <br><br>   But still came Hapoel. A brilliant scissor-kick from Hoban on 68  minutes was a fraction wide and then he tested Gordon with a well  executed shot on the bounce from outside the area. <br><br>   Celtic, the fans, players and manager began praying for the final  whistle; it was that part of the world after all. They got away with it,  just. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br><br><br>By Andy Campbell<br><br>BBC Sport Scotland<br><br> 1 hour ago From the section Football <br><br>Celtic celebrate<br>Celtic qualified for the Champions League group stage for the first time in three years<br><br>Celtic survived a second-leg onslaught to reach the Champions League group stage with a narrow aggregate play-off win over Hapoel Beer Sheva.<br><br>Beaten 2-0 in Israel, Brendan Rodgers&#39; side progressed on the strength of their 5-2 win in Glasgow last week.<br><br>Celtic keeper Craig Gordon saved Maharan Radi&#39;s penalty shortly before he was beaten by Ben Sahar&#39;s header.<br><br>Ovidiu Hoban capitalised on a mix-up between Gordon and Saidy Janko for Hapoel&#39;s second goal.<br><br>Celtic, who are likely to be in the fourth pot of seeds for the Champions League group stage, will discover their opponents when the draw is made on Thursday evening.<br><br> Celtic back where they belong - Rodgers<br><br>Cash reward but defensive frailties persist<br><br>Celtic return to the group stage of the competition for the first time in three years and will bank almost &pound;30m as a result.<br><br>The guaranteed income will give Rodgers - in his first season as Celtic boss - further opportunities to expand his squad before the transfer window closes next week.<br><br>It is in defence where Celtic&#39;s most pressing needs lie, with the side having kept only two clean sheets in 10 competitive matches this term - and none away from home.<br><br>Erik Sviatchenko was fit enough to make the bench, while fellow centre-back Jozo Simunovic is still some way off a return, leaving regular right-back Mikael Lustig to partner Kolo Toure at the heart of Celtic&#39;s back-line.<br>Celtic&#39;s Champions League income<br>&pound;2.6m for winning the play-off &pound;10.3m for group stage participation<br>&pound;10m television money &pound;7m from gate receipts<br>&pound;1.3m for group stage win &pound;0.43m for group stage draw<br>Night to forget for Janko<br><br>The Scottish Premiership winners knew a forceful opening from the hosts was likely, with the Israeli champions going for the 3-0 win that would have taken them through on away goals.<br><br>Janko, who struggled to deal with Hoban throughout, was penalised for the spot-kick and booked for a trip on Ofir Davidadze, although television replays suggested the challenge was just outside the area.<br><br>It mattered little, though, as Radi went too central with his effort, allowing Gordon to charge down.<br><br>Radi&#39;s corner was met by Sahar&#39;s downward header past Gordon and Kieran Tierney on the line, the striker netting moments after replacing the injured Lucio Maranhao.<br><br>In the early moments of the second half, Janko knocked the ball out of Gordon&#39;s hands as he came to collect a cross, leaving Hoban with a tap-in.<br><br>Barak Bakhar&#39;s side were now within touching distance of their target but Sahar and Hoban could not convert as Celtic were continually exposed.<br>Ben Sahar scores<br>Sahar (top left) scored Hapoel Beer Sheva&#39;s third goal of the two-legged play-off<br>Griffiths isolated in attack<br><br>Top scorer Leigh Griffiths had a frustrating evening up front for Celtic, who struggled to get out of their own half.<br><br>Just before the hour he was replaced by former Fulham striker Moussa Dembele, who fashioned Celtic&#39;s first real chance when curling wide from the left edge of the era after driving at the Hapoel defence.<br><br>Scott Sinclair then tested keeper David Goresh from near the penalty spot.<br><br>But that respite was short-lived as Hapoel reasserted their dominance in possession, making the final 25 minutes a nervous wait for the travelling fans.<br><br>The final whistle prompted celebrations for those supporters and the Celtic players and management as Hapoel were left to contemplate their consolation prize of a place in the Europa League group stage.<br><br><br><br><br>Match ends, Hapoel Be&#39;er Sheva 2, Celtic 0.<br>Full Time<br>90&#39;+5&#39;<br><br>Second Half ends, Hapoel Be&#39;er Sheva 2, Celtic 0.<br>Booking<br>90&#39;+3&#39;<br><br>Yuval Shabtay (Hapoel Be&#39;er Sheva) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.<br>90&#39;+3&#39;<br><br>Foul by Yuval Shabtay (Hapoel Be&#39;er Sheva).<br>90&#39;+3&#39;<br><br>Nir Bitton (Celtic) wins a free kick in the attacking half.<br>Booking<br>90&#39;+2&#39;<br><br>Craig Gordon (Celtic) is shown the yellow card.<br>90&#39;+2&#39;<br><br>Attempt missed.
