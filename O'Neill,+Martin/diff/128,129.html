Continued success, including a Uefa Cup final, has made him Celtic&#39;s most influential figure since Jock Stein. Intense, intelligent and highly-coveted, O&#39;Neill left Celtic in 2005 to look after his sick wife, Geraldine. </i>  <br><br>When Martin O&#39;Neill arrived at Celtic, there wasn&#39;t a huge crowd to greet him, nor was there the usual overblown fanfare you would normally get with any new incumbent at the helm of a club of Celtic&#39;s size. There was a fair crowd of people welcoming him, but truth be told no one was expecting much. <br><br>The prior season to his arrival can be best described as amongst the worst the club had endured post-takeover with the John Barnes/Kenny Dalglish managerial reign falling as low as can be. Rangers were in the ascendency and were arrogantly believing that this was a season where they were going to push up in Europe and have Celtic by the jugular under their spiky shoes (as per the writings of one of their more prominent fanzine writers).<br><br>How things were to turn out differently. Nobody could ever be said to believe what was to happen over the next few years, and the following only covers the true emotion of Martin&#39;s reign in brief for the whole Celtic support.<br></font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  2000-01</font><font face="Helvetica"><img align="right" alt="MoN" height="300" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/gZ5Q1hSgJeulotY8bnpmgw15373/GW310H300" title="MoN" width="310"></font></h3><font face="Helvetica">So how was MoN to begin to turnaround the whole club? Some thought that it was equivalent to turning the Titanic around in light of Rangers&#39; then hegemony. His first task was to rebuild the squad, and after losing Mark Viduka (the highest profile loss) he brought in players such as Sutton, Thompson and Agathe, and later Lennon (in Dec 2000) to change both the dynamic and atmosphere surrounding the whole squad. Add in the recovery of Henrik Larsson, after his horrendous injury the previous year, and he had the nucleus of a great team, a blessing for any manager.   <br><br>The first league game began well with a comfortable win against Dundee Utd which saw both Sutton &amp; Larsson score to get off the starting blocks for the season. An encouraging start followed with six wins on the trot (2 in the UEFA cup) and we were to next face our biggest challenge, the first game of the season against Rangers. Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s first game v Rangers was expect</font><font face="Helvetica">ed to be a real test of his nerve and ability. The Huns were arrogant and bloated from their spending over the prior couple of years. The match was set to play a part in how the season was to go, and overall there was only one team in the game, Celtic running out 6-2 victors (dubbed &quot;Demolition Derby&quot;). <br><br>The game has become legendary and Henrik Larsson stands out in this game more than anyone else. For Martin, this set things off perfectly for the rest of his time at Celtic. Passing his first test with flying colours put both his squad and the fans right behind him and effectively won us the psychological battle against the Huns. The match was a turning point in Scottish football and heralded a beginning to the end of Ranger&#39;s domestic dominance. Important was the contribution of his new signings, especially Sutton, and this surely gave the board greater confidence to back the manager in any of his demands.<br><br>During the season, Larsson cemented a perfect partnership with Chris Sutton, and with their single-minded determination to see Celtic achieve the best and put Rangers in their place, each played well off of each other, banging in the goals taking us further ahead of the Huns. We won the league by 15pts, with Henrik scoring a phenomenal 35 goals in 37 games. In contrast, Tore Andre Flo scored just 11 goals to be Rangers&#39; highest scorer and he cost the Huns a fortune (around &pound;12m).<br><br>Martin O&#39;Neil&#39;s inspired team completed an exceptional Treble that season (league, Scottish cup &amp; league cup), something that even the most optimistic Celtic fan at the start of the season could not believe would happen. </font><br><font face="Helvetica"><br>Martin O&#39;Neill had transformed Celtic in his first season. His hope to bring success to the club had been surpassed already. He became the first Celtic manager since Jock Stein to achieve the treble. Even he surely could not have believed that such an incredible first season was possible. We blew the opposition away, we played some great football and his man management allowed for a settled squad, the first we&#39;d had for a very long time.<font size="2"> </font><br><br>An interesting anecdote from Matt McGlone (ex-Celtic View columnist) on Martin O&#39;Neill highlighted his level of involvement at all levels. After a critical article by McGlone on the first team after losing 5-1 to Rangers, Martin O&#39;Neill stormed in to see Matt McGlone and castigate him over the article. According to McGlone, Martin O&#39;Neill was comprehensive in his role at Celtic and had a view and look at everything going on, and ensured that all was well set-up as he required for his players benefit. An important point that highlights just how thorough Martin O&#39;Neill was, and it played a part to transform the team and club environment to get the foundations laid for future success.<br></font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3>  </h3><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  2001-02</font><font face="Helvetica"><img align="right" alt="Martin O'Neill" height="309" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/5cc342914b49d2936f2a1b62bff99f2f/GW256H309" title="Martin O'Neill" width="256"></font></h3><font face="Helvetica">How was MoN to advance Celtic from the previous season&#39;s stellar campaign? We were way ahead of where we expected to be (helped admittedly by Rangers imploding), so season 2001-02 was to see the next stage by testing European waters. <br><br>A poor start in his first season saw Celtic go out very early doors in the UEFA Cup, and this time for this foray into the Champions league Celtic had to go begin the journey by overcoming Ajax in the preliminary round. To everyone&#39;s shock, Celtic won comfortably over the two legs, a three-two aggregate, with a wonderful 3-1 away in the first game, and Celtic were into the Champions League group stages for the first time.   <br><br>A tough group awaited Celtic with Juventus in pot one, and for Martin O&#39;Neill it was quite a step up in a short space of time for management at Celtic. A double European Cup winner with Notts Forest, MoN knew what it takes to compete in the tournament but times had changed and we were entering with some trepidation. <br><br>MoN worked his best but famously the team failed to go through even though the side had amassed 9 pts (just one behind Porto who came second), then a joint record points tally to not go qualify through, but it was Celtic&#39;s first run in the Champs League group stages and it was a good learning experience for all. In many ways, there was little more MoN could do more but he made the difference for the players to believe in themselves to be able to compete toe-to-toe with the best, and it was agonising to see us fall at the final hurdle. Celtic ended up dropping down into the UEFA cup, where the first team were to be knocked out on penalties. <br><br>Domestically, MoN was again on track. Things just couldn&#39;t go wrong for the first team in the league, which was won convincingly with 97pts, 15pts above Rangers who were second, and a goal difference of +61. A 3-0 win against Rangers away at Ibrox sealed Celtic&#39;s dominance for the season, the only blip being losing the Cups. The football was excellent, Larsson &amp; Sutton were banging in the goals and Martin O&#39;Neill was in his ascendancy. It really was a magical time. <br><br>His transfers had shored up the squad with John Hartson being the most notable in the season. In many ways, Hartson&#39;s transfer reflected MoN&#39;s attitude to football the most. A no nonsense back-to-basics forward, he definitely did not epitomise the modern footballer, but he was very effective and did the job in hand (his goal tally showed that clearly). Not a signing that initially got the fans applauding, but MoN&#39;s thinking on Hartson paid off and showed his general shrewdness in buying certain players.<br></font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3>  </h3><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  2002-03</font></h3><font face="Helvetica">A season never to be forgotten by any Celtic fan (or anyone else who was there to witness any of it!).   <br><br>Some analysts like to talk about &quot;Creative Destruction&quot;, the idea that once a disaster occurs it enables the entity to rebuild better than if it were trying to rebuild from being at the top. This can be applied to this season. Hopes were high, and the players were now fully accustomed to each other and more importantly to the manager. MoN&#39;s imprint on the side was unmistakable, moulding the squad into an efficient side, and all was heading in the right direction. <br><br>Then the disaster struck. In the qualifying round for the Champions league we lost to FC Basel (Swiss). A poor away performance cost us dearly and we could not make up for it in the return, conceding an unnecessary goal which cost us qualification to the group stages. We came close, and should have got it but didn&#39;t. What went wrong? MoN was broken more than anyone, but it was his responsibility to turn it all around. All had gone his way to date but now was a new challenge, and this was to test his ability as a manager to the limit. <br><br>Europe was the benchmark, and so had we failed? Actually, turned out to be the best thing that had ever happened to the club, and it began what has been gloriously dubbed &quot;The Road to Seville&quot;, our march to the UEFA Cup final in 2003 (Seville, Spain). Martin O&#39;Neill took the whole run in his stride, and as each match raised the bar that we had to jump over, he ensured that we were prepared for the challenges. When we played Blackburn, that was deemed a huge challenge, and even though we won the first leg, a consensus from the press agreed with the Blackburn manager (ex-Rangers manager Souness) that it was &quot;Men against Boys&quot; that we were played off the park. How MoN made them eat their words as he out-thought them tactically as we won the return leg in Blackburn as well. <br><br>From then on, MoN&#39;s teams had to battle and overcome Celta Vigo (violent players and incompetent referees), the highly rated Stuttgart (Germans) and then the big one, Liverpool, the biggest name to date. <br><br>For MoN (who formerly had played in England for a long period) if ever there was a chance to cement our reputation then this was it. Liverpool were very well fancied to easily win both games, and even though they had the better of the first game, MoN won the battles against his Liverpool counterpart and took the game to Liverpool at their own ground, getting tactics and formations correct, winning 2-0 in what can be said to have been in a manner that made it look easier for us than it was. In Neil Lennon&#39;s biography, he noted how MoN gave a rousing pre-match talk which set the players up. It looks to have made the difference. Martin O&#39;Neill was now a respected name throughout even England, not only for his work at lower league levels with Leicester but acknowledgement that he had the nous to manage at the highest level with the biggest sides. <br><br>The penultimate challenge in the semi-finals was against Boavista; a tough set of matches which saw Celtic come from behind (in aggregate terms) to win and make it to the final (overcoming much of the opposition&#39;s antics). It was a nervy affair, but it was thanks to Larsson&#39;s late winner that we got through. Martin O&#39;Neill was there all the way, and with his team had overcome all challenges to get to the final.<br><br>The final against Porto, sadly, did not work out as all had hoped. In truth, Porto were the better team on the day, however, Celtic fought to the bitter end with a fabulous performance from Henrik Larsson. We&#39;d a strong side but we had our weaknesses, and Porto out-thought MoN. Our tactics played into their hands, and MoN in this case should have adjusted our tactics to suit the opposition more, where any tackles led to diving and rolling about by Porto. Nevertheless, we never loss any respect for MoN, and he had taken us further than any of us could ever have hoped. Jose Mourinho (the Porto manager) later said in an interview that he was the lucky one that day and always brings up that match whenever he sees MoN.<br><br>Domestically, Celtic threw much of it away, knocked out by Inv Caley in the Scottish Cup and losing to Rangers in the League Cup Final, snuffed out the cup competitions. However, in the league it was too much to battle on two fronts, for the league and the UEFA Cup at the same time. It was a hard slog and there was no league extension (as the huns got in 2008), but we fought to the bitter end and lost the league on the last day. MoN surprisingly found it hard to get his way against Alex McLeish in the Old Firm games, but nevertheless it was the UEFA cup run that got both his and our full attention, and in that MoN excelled, and an almost dream season for MoN as much as for ourselves.<br><br>A season never to be forgotten, and MoN&#39;s place in this experience can never be downplayed.<br></font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3>  </h3><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  2003-04</font></h3><font face="Helvetica">Never easy for any manager to follow a successful season. Regardless, we hadn&#39;t won a trophy last season and we had to recover in this front no matter how successful we regarded 2002-03. We had to win back the league and prove ourselves again in Europe to show it was no flash in the pan, and that we could do it under Martin&#39;s management. Much of the season was overshadowed by the announcement that Larsson was not to renew his contract and had decided to move on. However, as the true professional he was, Larsson continued to work just as hard as ever to help the team reclaim the league.   <br><br>The league turned out to be less of a challenge than expected. Huns thought they were revitalised but weren&#39;t. We won the title comfortably, and Martin O&#39;Neill could celebrate a third SPL title in four seasons (and his last as it turned out). Completing the League &amp; Scottish Cup double piled on the agony for the Huns, but the quality of the play and the number of quality goals, really showed MoN&#39;s ability to fashion a consistently winning side. We almost made it through the season undefeated in the league, but lost two games late in the season which spoiled the record. Up until Aberdeen&#39;s win at Parkhead, Celtic had gone 77 games undefeated at home.<br><br>For Celtic, Europe had become the benchmark to measure ourselves, and taking our confidence from the UEFA cup run of the previous season, out belief was that this time we could make it through the group stages in the Champions League. Qualifying easily into the group stages, we then again fell agonisingly short of qualifying into the knockout stages with 7 pts for our third place against 9pts for the second place. <br><br>Martin O&#39;Neill deserves credit but also criticism: 0 away wins in six games is a poor return, and it was building in a mental block into the players which we since found hard to shake off in later seasons. Must add about the wonder goal at home v Lyon scored by Liam Miller following a 20 pass move, a sublime piece of teamwork fashioned by Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s men. If ever there were any quandaries about Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s style of play, then they should be shown that goal. It was a tribute to his coaching team and the good spirit within the club at the time.<br><br>The best was still to come - this time in the UEFA Cup - and Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s greatest triumph as Celtic manager. Celtic had drawn in-form Barcelona, and we were written off from the start. With players of the calibre of Ronaldinho to face, there was little hope that we were going to match them. Yet, Martin O&#39;Neil&#39;s men under his management sealed a famous 1-0 victory at home, and then drew in a hard-fought away match in Barcelona. Competing against Barcelona was hard enough, but losing Bobo Balde &amp; Rab Douglas for the away leg was something that made it ever so more difficult. MoN though took the brave decision with playing youngsters John Kennedy &amp; David Marshall, and it paid up trumps. The triumph was greater than the UEFA Cup final, and Celtic&#39;s first team had proven by knocking out Barcelona that Celtic were no flash in the pan. Celtic could compete with the best in this era. <br><br>A second quarter-final in the UEFA cup beckoned, but alas Celtic lost over the two legs to Villarreal, so hopes for a second UEFA cup final in a row were put to bed.<br><br>The highlight of the season for many though was surprisingly not the Barca win, the league victory or the Scottish cup final double. The best moment was the whitewash of five wins out of five against Rangers. The finale of this came from MoN&#39;s best signing, Chris Sutton, who in injury time scored a long range goal to win us the final game of the season against Rangers. The torment for the Rangers fans was unmeasurable, and the joy for all Celtic fans was sky-high. Martin O&#39;Neill simply had the upper hand in all the encounters, and his charges did all the good work for him.<br><br>O&#39;Neill also helped to give some good young players their first steps. Kennedy and Marshall outstanding at the Nou Camp, Liam Miller&rsquo;s (ultimately brief) purple patch, before he got snatched by old purple nose, McManus and McGeady both made debuts, while the likes of Jamie Smith, Ross Wallace and Craig Beattie all looked like they had something to offer. However, over time, excluding McGeady none of them have hit the major heights, but they mostly all had good solid careers at a decent level.<br><br><img align="right" alt="O'Neill shows his support fro Lennon" height="185" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/0cXf3OhbU5HoiDEff2n_gA11185/GW294H185" title="O'Neill shows his support fro Lennon" width="294">An important incident from this season showed the greatest aspect of Martin O&#39;Neill.

His time at the club was mixed and he left after a few seasons. <br><br>In 2013, MoN was announced as the Republic of Ireland manager with ex-Celtic player Roy Keane as his assistant. An interesting combination. There was to be added spice for the Celtic fans. If you ever read back to the old match threads, reports and reviews by Celtic fans from the 2000&#39;s, a common argument was &quot;<i>MoN v WGS</i>&quot;, as who was the better manager: Martin O&#39;Neill or Gordon Strachan? <br><br>The comparisons were difficult, and the arguments at times nauseating, but in 2014 both Martin O&#39;Neill and Gordon were drawn to face each other in competitive matches for the Euro 2016 Championships. The first match was actually played at Celtic Park as Hampden was being renovated, and Scotland triumphed 1-0; the return leg was 1-1 with ex-Celt Maloney (who had played under both at Celtic) the scorer for Scotland in both games. Nobody was going to truly believe this would settle any old arguments. Time had passed by for the old debaters, and both managers should be respected for their time at Celtic.<br><br>Both sides were arguably poor, and Martin O&#39;Neill came out worst in that the performance illustrated that Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s old methods were now out of date, especially with the poor personnel he had at this point with Ireland. Critics had thought he had lost his fire probably ten years ago and was seeming to now be living off his laurels from his Celtic tenure. However, Martin O&#39;Neill led Ireland through to the last 16 of the Euros (2016) where they lost to France 2-1, beating a second-string Italy side who still should have been too strong for Ireland. A great achievement and showed he still had the making of a good coach but the cracks were showing.<br><br>Martin O&#39;Neill almost pulled off a second trick in the World Cup 2018 qualifiers but were thrashed in the second leg play-off matches to Denmark.

There is some truth in it but it has been way over-blown.   <br><br>After leaving school, Martin O&#39;Neill began a law degree at Queen&#39;s University in Belfast but left after around a year in order to pursue a career as a footballer (so hardly qualifies him as a lawyer in any shape or form, or anything legal really). <br><br>Nevertheless, he has been known to have a keen fascination for legal stories, and has remained an avid follower of criminology, having attended some of Britain&#39;s most infamous trials including that of the Yorkshire Ripper. His fascination apparently began with the James Hanratty case of 1961, and he has been said to take his family on legal trail hunts for his personal interest. <br><br>You can take from this what you like on its influence on his managerial ability.<br></font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  Honours with Celtic</font></h3><font face="Helvetica"><b>Domestic Treble (League, Scottish Cup, League Cup)   <br></b>  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2"><a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2000-01 </a></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica"><b>UEFA Cup runners-up   <br></b>  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2"><a href="/page/The+Road+To+Seville" target="_self">2002-03</a></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica"><b>Scottish Cup Winners   <br></b>  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+2000-2001" target="_self">2001</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+2003-04" target="_self">2004</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+2004-05" target="_self">2005</a></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica"><b>Scottish Premier League Winners   <br></b>  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2"><a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2000-01</a>, <a href="/page/2002" target="_self">2001-02</a>, <a href="/page/2004" target="_self">2003-04</a></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica"><b>Scottish League Cup winners   <br></b>  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2"><a href="/page/2001" target="_self">2000-01</a></font><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  Managerial Awards (in Scotland)</font></h3><font face="Helvetica"><b>SPL Manager of the Month (9): </b>  <br></font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">August 2000, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">December 2000, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">February 2001, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">August 2001, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">April 2002, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">November 2002, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">October 2003, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">November 2003, </font></li>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">January 2005</font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica"><b>SPL Manager of the Year (1):</b>  <br></font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">2003-04</font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica"><b>SFWA Manager of the Year (3): </b>  <br></font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica" size="2">2000-01, 2001-02, 2003-04</font><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica">  </font><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  Pictures </font></h3><font face="Helvetica">  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica"><a href="/page/O%27Neill%2C+Martin+-+Manager+Pics" target="_self">Picture Gallery</a><br></font></li></ul><font face="Helvetica">  </font><h3><font face="Helvetica">  Videos</font></h3><font face="Helvetica">  </font><ul>  <li>  <font face="Helvetica"><a class="external" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1450213683520175897&hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Martin O&#39;Neill -

In the dressing room before the match he gave us an unforgettable talk. I personally do not think we needed much motivation as we were all sure of ourselves and positive that we would compete and get a result. Yet Martin&#39;s words inspired us to even greater heights of determination. He looked around the dressing room and pointed out young Shaun Maloney. &#39;This is a European quarter-final and this boy is only nineteen, but he might never get this opportunity again.&#39; He looked around the older guys and added: &#39;You guys in your thirties probably won&#39;t get the opportunity again to prove a point, to prove to England and Europe that you deserve respect, and that you are worthy of respect, and that you are worthy of a place in the semi-finals.&#39; He made his points tellingly in his usual manner and did so in two or three minutes, yet by the time he had finished we were ready to go out and run through brick walls if we needed to.&quot;<br><b>From an extract from Neil Lennon&#39;s autobiography, <i>(</i> Lennon, Neil (2006)<i> Neil Lennon: Man and Bhoy. </i>HarperSport, </b><b>ISBN-10: </b><b>0007233477) </b><b>which describes gaffer Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s famously inspirational speech at Anfield prior to the game.</b><br><br>&quot;I&rsquo;ve never met O&rsquo;Neill, but was once told an illuminating story about him. He was sitting before some assembled press, one of whom raised the point that O&rsquo;Neill never worked with his players in training during the week. Don&rsquo;t you think, the journalist continued, that you could go one step further and improve the players&rsquo; technical skills if you were to work with them more? <br>&ldquo;Do you know what, that has never occurred to me,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s such a great idea I am going to start that next week. The only problem is I&rsquo;ve been so busy winning matches I haven&rsquo;t had time to do it!&rdquo; O&rsquo;Neill was making the point that managers are judged by the matches they win and not necessarily for the team&rsquo;s style. He is a clever man but even he could not have anticipated the success achieved during his short time in charge. &quot;<br><b>Tony Cascarino, 2007<br><br></b>&quot;Martin wasn&rsquo;t a training ground manager, he was more of a psychologist, but he was very good at getting the best out of his players.

He was always positive with you, never negative, and that was brilliant to hear in the dressing-room.&quot;<br><b>Jackie McNamara (Jr) (2011)</b><br><br>&ldquo;Martin had clear ideas. He would tell me: &lsquo;Lubo, I do not want to see you come back and take the ball from the centre-backs and play the easy pass. I want you near the penalty box to make passes and score goals.
