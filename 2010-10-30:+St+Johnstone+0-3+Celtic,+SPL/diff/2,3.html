Only down side (and Mjallby needs to fix  this) defenders are still getting drawn out of position towards the  ball.  Not as much today with Glenda left out but it&#39;s still a problem  and a bette team could have punished us (like the Huns did). AT one  point 3 (that&#39;s THREE) players went to meet their wide player in  posession, which obviously leaves at least one or two of their players  free in and arond the box.<br><br>My MOM were:<br><br>1. E. Izaguirre - Great perofrmance, too many good things to write here, edges it over Ki for goal.<br>2. KI S.Y. - Midfield general today. Unlucky not to score. Best game in the hoops, keep it up Dave!<br>3.  A Stokes - never gave up the whole game, few things din&#39;t come off but  played with the kind of Heart that should beat inside a Celtic jersey.<br><br>Special mention to Samaras. Always rediculous, sometimes sublime.<br><br>Ditto McGinn - Didn&#39;t do much else than score 2 goals. <br><br>If  his second was scored by a Hun and i was a Hun journalist (is there any  other kind?) i would describe it as &quot;Another example of the Northern  Irishman&#39;s left foot is as sweet as his right as he fooled the entire St  Johnstone defence with deftly placed strike in beside the post which no  keeper in the world could have reached. The Republic of Ireland must  curse the fact that he didn&#39;t choose to play for them and this young man  along with Lafferty, Davis, Little, Feeney and Healy will one day take  Northern Ireland beyond the group stages at the next world cup. Luxury  Celtic misfit McCourt will probably never make the squad again.&quot;<br><br>Mon the teuchter Huns noo!<br><i>(by Pieol of KDS forum)</i><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div class="statslist">    <div class="colone">       <h3>St Johnstone</h3>       <ul class="teamlist"><li>15Smith</li><li>02MacKay</li><li>03Graingeryellow card, red card</li><li>06Duberry</li><li>19Maybury</li><li>07Millar</li><li>10Craig</li><li>16MacDonaldyellow card (Samuel 57)</li><li>22Milne (Parkin 56)</li><li>25Myrie-Williams (Rutkiewicz 74)</li><li>27Haber</li></ul>       Substitutes       <ul class="subs"><li>01Enckelman, </li><li>05Rutkiewicz, </li><li>37Caddis, </li><li>32May, </li><li>09Parkin, </li><li>21Samuel, </li><li>23Jackson</li></ul>    </div>    <div class="coltwo">       <h3>Celtic</h3>       <ul class="teamlist"><li>26Forster</li><li>03Izaguirre</li><li>05Majstorovic</li><li>11Cha Du-Ri </li><li>12Wilson</li><li>25Rogne</li><li>14McGinnyellow card</li><li>16Ledley</li><li>18Ki Sung-Yeung</li><li>09Samaras</li><li>10Stokes</li></ul>       Substitutes       <ul class="subs"><li>24Zaluska, </li><li>04Juarez, </li><li>06Hooiveld, </li><li>21Mulgrew, </li><li>31Towell, </li><li>17Crosas, </li><li>20McCourt</li></ul>Goals<br><ul class="left"><li class="event_13748069">McGinn 2</li><li class="event_13748222">Izaguirre 41</li><li class="event_13748430">McGinn 89</li></ul></div>    <div class="additional">Ref: Murray<br>Att: 6,866</div> </div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9137535.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match Report</a></li></ul>  <h3>  Pictures </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a href="/page/2010-10-30%3A+St+Johnstone+0-3+Celtic%2C+SPL+-+Pics" target="_self">Match Pictures </a></li></ul>  <h3>  KStreet </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8391521/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pre-match   </a></li><li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8392010/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match</a>   </li><li>  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8392040/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Post Match</a></li></ul><h3>MOTM</h3> <ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8392038/4/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Voting Thread</a><br>   </li><li>Result Thread</li><li>Winner - <br></li><li><a href="/page/KDS+MOTM+Winners+10%2F11" target="_self">2010-11 Winners</a></li></ul>     <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Stats</h3><div class="possession">       <h3>Possession</h3>                     <ul><li class="hometeam">St Johnstone 42%</li><li class="awayteam">Celtic 58%</li></ul>    </div>    <div class="shotsOnTarget">       <h3>Attempts on target</h3>                     <ul><li class="hometeam">St Johnstone 2</li><li class="awayteam">Celtic 8</li></ul>    </div>    <div class="shotsOffTarget">       <h3>Attempts off target</h3>                     <ul><li class="hometeam">St Johnstone 4</li><li class="awayteam">Celtic 11</li></ul>    </div>    <div class="corners">       <h3>Corners</h3>                     <ul><li class="hometeam">St Johnstone 1</li><li class="awayteam">Celtic 6</li></ul>    </div>    <div class="fouls">       <h3>Fouls</h3>                     <ul><li class="hometeam">St Johnstone 14</li><li class="awayteam">Celtic 10</li></ul>    </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>ESPN</h3>A Niall McGinn double helped take Celtic level on points with Clydesdale Bank Premier League leaders Rangers in a comfortable win over St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.&bull; The Hoops&#39; wide man had the visitors ahead with just over a minute gone and four minutes from the end of a one-side half, left-back Emilio Izaguirre grabbed the second.The second period was low-key but four minutes from time Perth defender Danny Grainger, booked for dissent following the opening goal, was awarded a second yellow by referee Calum Murray for a foul on Anthony Stokes.In the final minute, with Saints&#39; spirit broke, McGinn completed an impressive performance when he scored his second from a Cha Du-Ri pass to put the pressure on Rangers who play Inverness at Ibrox later today.There was some disruption before the game when Celtic skipper Shaun Maloney, originally on the team sheet after recovering from an eye injury, had to withdraw due to illness.Cha, dropped for Mark Wilson, was reinstated in midfield while Charlie Mulgrew was called down from the stand to go on the bench.However, the disruption did little to disrupt the visitors and they took the lead with little over a minute gone, after Perth midfielder Liam Craig had fouled Georgios Samaras.Midfielder Ki Sung-yueng cut the free-kick back to Stokes whose drive was parried by Saints keeper Graeme Smith to the feet of McGinn who slammed in the rebound from close range.The Irishman then raced to take the acclaim of the Hoops fans behind the goal which earned him a booking from referee Murray.The McDiarmid Park pitch had passed a morning inspection following heavy rain but Celtic adapted well and in the eighth minute Ki rattled a drive against the post after taking a clever pass from Stokes, with Cha driving the rebound from distance high over the bar.The visitors looked in control and in the 19th minute, in a breakaway, Stokes had a low drive from 18 yards saved by Smith before the former Hibernian striker headed a Wilson cross wide from eight yards out.Moments later Stokes again missed the target from another Wilson cross. It looked ominous for the Perth men.St Johnstone had rallied from the loss of three early goals against Celtic in their Co-operative Insurance Cup defeat in midweek but there was nothing to encourage the home support.Everything that went in the Saints box appeared to cause trouble and on the half-hour mark, Samaras blasted high over after being set up by stand-in captain Daniel Majstorovic.As the first half drew to a close Marcus Haber and Peter MacDonald had efforts but Celtic keeper Fraser Forster remained untroubled.In the 41st minute the home side were in further trouble when Izaguirre intercepted a slack back pass by Steven Milne at the edge of the box and burst through past Dave Mackay to slip the ball under Smith.The match looked beyond St Johnstone and in the 49th minute only a fine save by Smith from Izaguirre, after good work by Stokes at the edge of the box in brushing off Mackay, prevented a third.Moments later at the other end, Marcus Haber missed a sitter after Forster had parried from Jennison Myrie-Williams and would have been happy to see the flag raised for offside.Sam Parkin and Collin Samuel replaced Milne and Peter MacDonald in the 57th minute as McInnes tried something different to get into the match.The game was petering out although in a rare Saints attack Forster had to move smartly from his goal to take the ball away from the toes of Parkin. In the 82nd minute McGinn raced on to an Izaguirre pass down the left and cut the ball back for Samaras but the Greece international missed the target from 12 yards.Four minutes from time Grainger walked after receiving his second and then McGinn grabbed his second with a mis-kicked shot from Cha&#39;s cut-back.However, there was nothing fortuitous about Celtic&#39;s win.<br><br>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>    </h3><div class="headline"><h3>     St Johnstone 0-3 Celtic   </h3></div>                                                                                                                                   By Martin Conaghan                                                                             <br>                                                                                                              <b>                            Celtic kept their first clean sheet in six matches with a comfortable win against St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park.                            </b>                            <br>                            Niall McGinn fired in with just 69 seconds played after Saints keeper Graeme Smith parried a long-range shot.                             <br>                            Emilio Izaguirre slotted home his first Celtic goal before the  break, then Saints&#39; Danny Grainger was sent off in the 87th minute for a  second booking.                             <br>                            McGinn sealed the points in the final minute with a mis-hit shot that bobbled past Smith in the Saints goal.                                            <div class="bo">                                                      The win puts Celtic within a point of Rangers at the top of the  table, after the Ibrox side drew with Inverness Caledonian Thistle in  the later kick-off.                             <br>                            Glenn Loovens was dropped from Celtic&#39;s starting line-up, with Thomas Rogne and Mark Wilson stepping in.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      Shaun Maloney was expected to return to the Celtic midfield, but  was replaced at the last minute by Cha Du-Ri after complaining of  feeling unwell.                             <br>                            Jennison Myrie-Williams earned a start for St Johnstone in place  of the injured Murray Davidson, while Marcus Haber, Peter MacDonald and  Steven Milne came in for Collin Samuel, Sam Parkin and Andy Jackson.                             <br>                            With just over one minute on the clock, Celtic opened the  scoring when Ki Sung-Yong delivered a low free kick back into the St  Johnstone penalty area from wide on the right and Stokes fired in from  18 yards. However, keeper Smith parried and McGinn pounced on the  rebound to blast the ball into the back of the net.                             <br>                            Five minutes later, Stokes back-heeled a neat ball into the  penalty area and Ki struck the woodwork with a blistering shot as Celtic  took the match by the scruff of the neck.                             <br>                            A shell-shocked St Johnstone struggled to gain a foothold on the  match in the early stages, although Grainger blasted in a bold 25-yard  effort in the 16th minute that drifted wide of the target.                             <br>                            Stokes replied with a right-footed effort from the edge of the  St Johnstone penalty area that Smith held well, then the Northern  Ireland international missed with a close-range header from a Mark  Wilson long-ball.                             <br>                            Saints midfielder Liam Craig struggled to control a loose ball  just shortly after the half-hour mark, and sent a wild shot out for a  goal-kick, then Georgios Samaras nodded a header towards the hosts&#39; goal  that Smith effortlessly collected.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      As half-time approached, Peter McDonald looped a header towards  Celtic keeper Fraser Forster that cleared the bar, then a Grainger  corner failed to test the visitors&#39; defence.                             <br>                            Izaguirre capitalised on a slack defensive pass-back by Milne  four minutes from the break and glided into the St Johnstone penalty  area before calmly slotting past Smith to give the hosts a two-goal lead  at the interval.                             <br>                            Four minutes after the restart, Cha warmed Smith&#39;s hands with a  blistering shot from wide on the right after Stokes unselfishly played  the South Korea defender through.                             <br>                            Moments later, Myrie-Williams forced a save from Forster, then  Haber slipped in from an offside position but was unable to capitalise  on the rebound.                             <br>                            Some good build-up play from Haber near the hour mark fizzled  out in the Celtic penalty area with Parkin waiting on the final ball.                             <br>                            Samuel flighted in a 68th minute cross that Myrie-Williams  awkwardly sent towards the Celtic goal, but Forster was up to the  challenge and cleared the danger.                             <br>                            St Johnstone continued to search for an opening, although Parkin  was caught in an offside position with a close-range header in the 78th  minute.                             <br>                            Samaras almost made it three for Celtic with less than 10  minutes to play, but lost his footing and sent a close-range shot wide  of Smith&#39;s right-hand post.                             <br>                            Grainger was sent in for an early bath for a second bookable  offence following a tackle on Stokes, then Smith was at full-stretch as  Ki curved in a long-range free-kick that inched wide.                             <br>                            The match was over as a contest when McGinn swung a leg at a  loose ball in the dying minutes of the game and the ball drifted past  Smith and into the back of the St Johnstone net.                             </div>                              <div class="bo">                                           </div>                              Story from BBC SPORT:<br> http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9137535.stm<br> <br> Published: 2010/10/30 13:00:48 GMT<br> <br> &copy; BBC MMX    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="matchLiveText collapsible">    <ul><li> Final Result </li><li> Full Time </li><li> 90:00+2:15  The match has reached full-time.        </li><li> 90:00+0:26  Unfair challenge on Anthony Stokes by Kevin Rutkiewicz results in a free kick.
