Tired of seeing his team torn apart and players recruited by the big spending, high revenue teams in Italy, Spain, Germany and England, he proposed setting up a league which would maximise the revenue of smaller clubs which, though successful in their own countries, were unable to break into the revenue and largesse enjoyed by the regular participants in the latter stages of the Champions League. What was envisaged was a league made up of the top teams from Belgium, Holland, Scotland, Portugal, Denmark, Norway and Sweden playing each other in a competition which was not controlled by UEFA or any of the various national leagues. The games would attract media interest and generate, it was hoped, significant television revenue for the participating clubs which would better allow then to compete against what would become the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-14" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G14</a> clubs.<br><br>The ideas were developed at the beginning of the 1999-00 season and MacDonald went to Ajax to listen to the proposals, returning animated and enthusiastically advocating their investigation. He believed that this showed a direction which Celtic could take which would remove them from the big-fish-in-a-small-pond view that was Scottish football even under the recently started <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Premier_League" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Scottish Premier League</a>. The ideas were made public in Scotland at the Annual General Meeting in September 1999 and picked up by the media. The SPL chief executive, Roger Mitchell, immediately spat the dummy over the proposals saying that Rangers (for they too had jumped onto the bandwagon that MacDonald had started rolling, after initially indicating that they were not interested) and Celtic had a contract to fulfil with the SPL and as such the Atlantic League was a non-starter. Kenny Dalglish went so far as to state that he believed that Celtic would not be playing in Scottish football within five years. MacDonald was very clear on what he wanted. <br><br>He said: <br><blockquote>&quot;If there is going to be change then we want to be part of the discussions. Celtic, together with the SPL and the SFA, must be proactive with UEFA, FIFA and others in discussions on how to make the economic model better. <br>&ldquo;I don&#39;t know what the outcome will be. <br>&quot;It is clear that when a Premier League manager cannot afford a player&#39;s salary because it is the equivalent of a sixth of the turnover of his business, and you contrast that with Barcelona who I understand have just done a pay-per-view deal worth $50million a year for five years, and you contrast that with Celtic and Rangers who genuinely want to compete in Europe and therefore compete to attract the better players, then obviously the economic model which we have in Scotland is not going to generate success in Europe for any Scottish club. <br>&quot;We have to have discussions on how we develop a scenario which works for everyone and Celtic are going to be involved in those discussions.&quot; <br>&quot;In our strategic review we are looking at the market in which we operate and asking if Celtic can compete in Europe in this market. <br>&quot;If you look at the economics there needs to be change. The current Scottish model is not a good one. <br>&quot;If that ultimately means we play our football in a market other than Scotland and it&#39;s for the betterment of Celtic and Scottish football then that is what will happen. <br>&quot;Let&#39;s be practical. We won&#39;t bring other clubs with us in terms of where we play our football. I don&#39;t know the answer but whatever it is it has to be healthy for Scottish football - not Celtic in isolation. <br>&quot;We can&#39;t be too parochial because we will be seen as trying to row our own boat and others will try to frustrate us. <br>&quot;I advocate an approach which looks at everybody&#39;s interests - see if there is a solution which we could all still be part of but there must be change.&quot;<br>&quot;For domestic competition alone last season (1998-99) I&#39;m told Manchester United received TV money somewhere in the region of &pound;10million. Negotiations will start soon on the English premiership TV rights and they are expected to be worth &pound;1billion. In total we got pounds &pound;3.4million. Celtic earn just 8% of their total revenue from television rights, as opposed to 26% by English Premiership clubs and 37% in Serie A. &pound;3.8million a year doesn&rsquo;t secure many stars.<br>&quot;In terms of the number of spectators coming through the turnstiles we are the fifth biggest club in the world, yet the money we receive is minuscule. It all comes down to TV audiences. What can you attract? Italy, Germany, France and England are all plus 50million in terms of audience. You then look at Spain with 35million. <br>&quot;In Holland there is 15million, in Scotland 5million and if you put that together with Portugal, Belgium and others you might get a 50 million round-up. That makes sense and has to be given consideration.&quot; <br><br></blockquote>(quoted from <i>Daily Record</i>, 5/10/99)<br><br>What has to be borne in mind is that this was a very fluid and dynamic period in the history and development of the game. The G14 group were finding their own feet. UEFA and FIFA as runners and rulers of the game were realising that they could no longer run the game without consultation, but their positions were not clear and they frequently found themselves at loggerheads. But overwhelmingly what was being felt was the influence of money, media and market. The game was going world-wide. Clubs and the game had to move or be l
