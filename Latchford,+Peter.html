A likable and  athletic character Latchford was prone to conceding the odd soft goal  but for the most part he was a solid last line of defence who was  capable of pulling off some truly astounding saves.<br><br>In March 1975  he lost a howler of a goal to Danny Kellachan of Partick Thistle and  the fans wondered what had possessed Jock Stein to sign him but in May  he was Celtic&#39;s keeper in the 3-1 win against Airdrie in the 1975  Scottish Cup Final and by the end of that year he was well established  as Celtic&#39;s number one, seeing off the challenges of both Ally Hunter  and Denis Connaghan in the process.<br><br>He established himself as the  Celtic number one during the 1975/76 season and although Celtic did not  win any silverware the big Englishman had a fine season. In October  1975 he saved a penalty from Alves when Celtic grabbed a great 0-0 draw  in Oporto against Boavista in the ECWC.<br><br>In the 1976/77 season  Peter was excellent, bolstered by the superb Pat Stanton-Roddy MacDonald  central defensive partnership in front of him. He had a magnificent  game in the 2-2 draw at Ibrox in March 1977 which all but guaranteed the  league. With minutes remaining Peter, who was limping because of  injury, hurled himself across goal to turn away an Alex MacDonald shot  much to the approval of the Celtic fans jammed behind his goal.<br><br>In  1978 he was named as the Celtic Supporters Association Player of the  Year because of his heroics throughout the disastrous 1977/78 which  would have been a lot worse had it not been for Latchford&#39;s consistent  displays. Sadly the defence in front of him was an unmitigated disaster.  In March 1978 against Hearts at Hampden in a League Cup semi final he  made a breathtaking save, throwing himself at the feet of Malcolm  Robertson as he looked set to score, helping Celtic to a 2-0 win.<br><br>In  late 1978 he lost his place for a short period to Roy Baines but  regained his spot and on May 21st 1979 he was a hero in the 4-2 title  winning game against Rangers though he had contributed greatly earlier  in the season by saving a penalty from Rangers&#39; Alex Miller in a 3-1  Celtic derby victory in September.<br><br>In March 1980 he was  controversially fouled in the Bernabeau stadium against Real Madrid and  could do nothing to prevent the 3-0 defeat that night. On May 10th 1980  he was a solid presence in an inexperienced Celtic defence when he won  his third Scottish Cup Final medal when Celtic defeated Rangers 1-0. On  the stroke of full time, after 120 minutes, Peter clutched not only a  high ball but Mike Conroy also, and as the two of them disentangled the  referee blew for full time with a happy Peter posing happily, still  retaining the ball in his arms.<br><br>In the summer of 1980 Peter  suffered a hand injury and Pat Bonner took over the keeper&#39;s role and  would be Celtic&#39;s first choice until 1995. Peter surprisingly stayed  until 1987 much to the detriment of his career as he could have been a  first choice elsewhere, but he remained loyal to Celtic.<br><br>He had a  rare appearance on October 1st 1980 against Politechnica of Rumania and  was again controversially fouled, causing the goal which eliminated  Celtic.<br><br>In January 1986 he answered the call and helped the Hoops  during an uncomfortable period when Bonner was injured. On January 11th  1986, ever the character, he chased Eric Black outside the area and  performed a spectacular sliding tackle. It was well loved by all who saw the incident (see <a href="/page/1986-01-11%3A+Celtic+1-1+Aberdeen%2C+Premier+Division" target="_self">match report</a>). He helped to stabilise the  defence although Bonner returned in March and the title was won again in  May.<br><br>Peter had a wonderful rapport with the Celtic fans and  before each game they would chant - &#39;Peter Latchford, give us a wave&#39; -  to which Peter would wave and the fans would roar their approval. He was  a likable character and hugely popular with the fans throughout his  Celtic days.<br><br>In the 1978/79 season Peter played in opposition to  his brother Dave Latchford who was Motherwell&#39;s goalkeeper during  several Celtic-Motherwell games that season. His other brother was Bob  Latchford, a hugely successful England international, who is mainly  remembered for his period at Everton between 1974 and 1981 and who had a  fine partnership with Kevin Keegan for England.<br><br>His last game was as a losing finalist to Rangers in the <a href="/page/Glasgow+Cup" target="_self">Glasgow Cup</a> on 7th May, 1987 when the young makeshift Celtic team was beaten by a <a href="/page/Baillie%2C+Lex" target="_self">Lex Baillie</a>  own-goal. On leaving Celtic he had two seasons with Clyde before  retiring from playing at the age of 35. He went into Goalkeeper coaching  and had spells with Forfar, Clyde and Hearts. He rejoined Celtic as  Goalkeeping coach at the start of the 1997-98 season, when Pat Bonner  left. He was sacked from that position by <a href="/page/David+Kells" target="_self">David Kells</a> on the day that Kenny Dalglish and John Barnes were appointed, on 10th June 1999.<br><br>Latchford  remains a popular figure among the Celtic support and he is a regular  pundit on Celtic TV where he makes no attempt to hide his love for the  Hoops. At his very best Peter was undoubtedly a first class keeper and  there were several games that Celtic won or in the worst case had the  points saved by him - the other side of the coin was that at his worst  Peter could give the support nightmares with some shocking mistakes but  over the piece he was a real character and well liked by the fans.<br><br>At time of writing, he is still a goalkeeping coach with Queen of the South.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" height="109" width="505">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1975-87</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  187</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  27</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  39</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  19</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  272</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Shut-outs: </td><td align="center" width="16%">52</td><td align="center" width="16%">9</td><td align="center" width="16%">15</td><td align="center" width="16%">6</td><td align="center" width="16%">82 <br>(30%)</td></tr></tbody></table>  </div><h3>Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>Scottish League<br></b><ul><li><font size="2"><a href="/page/1977" target="_self">1976-77</a>, <a href="/page/1979" target="_self">1978-79</a></font></li></ul><b>Scottish Cup<br></b><ul><li><font size="2"> <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1974-75" target="_self">1975</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1976-77" target="_self">1977</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1979-80" target="_self">1980</a></font></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <font color="#333333"><a href="/page/Latchford%2C+Peter+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></font></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <h3>     The Bhoy In The Picture: Peter Latchford</h3><h3>  <img align="right" alt="Latchford, Peter - Kerrydale Street" height="224" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/UFHARhrMhkod1VoOLjJvtQ9635/GW196H224" title="Latchford, Peter - Kerrydale Street" width="196"></h3> Written by St Anthony (<a class="external" href="http://celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=769:the-bhoy-in-the-picture-peter-latchford&catid=36:images&Itemid=60" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Celtic Underground</a>)<br>Sunday, 25 September 2011 08:52  <br> <br>Peter Latchford signed for Celtic on loan in February 1975 and I can   still vividly recall a game against Partick Thistle shortly after. It   was a horrible wet and windy day and the conditions on the Parkhead   pitch were terrible. A Partick Thistle defender, by the name of Danny   Kellachan, sent a high free kick into the Celtic penalty area. He over   hit it and Latchford misjudged that the ball was going over his bar and   could only look on in horror as the ball dropped behind him and into  the  empty net. To say the Celtic fans were not impressed by their new   goalie is putting it mildly. <br> <br> It says a lot for the big genial Englishman that he had the strength of   character to overcome such a setback and go on to be one of the most   popular Celtic players of that era. It also says a lot for the patience   of the Celtic fans that they did not turn on the big man and allowed  him  to find his feet (and his hands !) in due course in Scottish  football.     It&rsquo;s said that England boss Don Revie, a close friend of  Jock Stein,  recommended Latchford when Stein was looking for a &lsquo;keeper  at a time  when Denis Connaghan and Ally Hunter were failing to impress.  He arrived  at Parkhead from West Bromwich Albion at a difficult time  when the  great Celtic team of the 1970&rsquo;s was going through a period of   transition. <br> <br>Peter&rsquo;s biggest advantage was that he quickly established a  brilliant  rapport with the Celtic fans. Before each game, especially at  Parkhead,  the fans had their pre match ritual and would chant:<br>&lsquo;Peter Latchford, Peter Latchford, give us a waaaaave, give us a waaaaave !!!&rsquo;<br> <br>To which Peter would reply with a wave. The fans would then chant back:<br><i>&lsquo;Latchford !!!&rsquo;&hellip;. &lsquo;Latchford !!!&rsquo;&hellip;.. (or very occasionally) &lsquo;Latchford for England !....Latchford for England !&rsquo;</i><br> <br>However  much we loved the big man it was clearly a ridiculous  proposition that  he could compete with either the great Peter Shilton or  Ray Clemence  as England goalkeeper although he did revel in the  nickname &lsquo;The Cat&rsquo;  which was a slightly double edged nickname some fans  had bestowed on  him.<br> <br>At that time street vendors sold button badges with distasteful   slogans outside Parkhead (one can still recall the likes of &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a   soft spot for Rangers &ndash; quicksand&rsquo; or &lsquo;1690 &ndash; we want a replay&rsquo;) and   there was one for Peter &ndash; &lsquo;Latchford holds more balls than Britt Ekland.&rsquo; Wonder if Rod Stewart had one of them, the attractive Miss Ekland being a glamorous flame of Rod&rsquo;s from that period.<br>Peter  Latchford had many fine games for Celtic. He saved a penalty  from  Boavista&rsquo;s Alves in Portugal in October 1975 which helped Celtic to  the  quarter finals of the old European Cup Winners Cup. He had another   fine match against Real Madrid at Parkhead in 1980 but had a sorry   experience in the second leg in the Bernabeau when he was impeded for   Real&rsquo;s first goal on the night when Celtic when down narrowly on   aggregate.<br> <br>Celtic fans will always take to their hearts players who excel in   games against Rangers and Peter was most capable in that respect. In   March 1977 he received a shoulder injury at Ibrox and bravely played on   as there were no substitute goalkeepers in those days. With minutes to   go and the game tied at 2-2 he threw himself across goal to palm away a   goal bound header by Alex MacDonald much to his own discomfort but to   the great appreciation of the Celtic fans massed on the terracing  behind  his goal.<br> <br>In September 1978 he saved a penalty from Alex Miller to help Celtic   to a 3-1 victory however his best performance against Rangers came at   Ibrox in December 1979 in what was Celtic&rsquo;s last game of that decade.   The Ibrox pitch was frosty and rock solid and Celtic did not play well.   Time and again Rangers threw balls into the box with &lsquo;Gas Meter&rsquo;  defying  the Rangers forwards. Eventually he was only beaten by a Derek   Johnstone header after he had lost his footing on the treacherous   surface but, thankfully, Bobby Lennox equalised within 60 seconds.<br> <br>In the summer of 1980 Peter suffered a hand injury and Pat Bonner   took over the keeper&#39;s role and would be Celtic&#39;s first choice until   1995. Peter surprisingly stayed until 1987 much to the detriment of his   career as he could have been a first choice elsewhere, but he remained   loyal to Celtic.<br> <br>In the 1978/79 season Peter played in opposition to his brother Dave   Latchford who was Motherwell&#39;s goalkeeper during several   Celtic-Motherwell games that season. His other brother was Bob   Latchford, a hugely successful England international, who is mainly   remembered for his period at Everton between 1974 and 1981 and who had a   fine partnership with Kevin Keegan for England in the 1970&rsquo;s.<br> <br>It has to be said that Peter had his flaws as a goalkeeper but he  was  generally forgiven by the fans who appreciated that the big man  gave  his all. A likable and athletic character Latchford was prone to   conceding the odd soft goal but for the most part he was a solid last   line of defence who was capable of pulling off some truly astounding   saves.<br> <br>My own favourite memory of Peter is at the end of the 1980 Scottish   Cup final. After 120 minutes of play Celtic were hanging on to a 1-0   lead when Peter came out for a high ball on the penalty spot. He caught   the ball but also grabbed team mate Mike Conroy round the neck and the   two of them became caught up together. After disentangling the referee   blew the final whistle and Peter, with ball still in hand, turned   joyfully to salute the Celtic fans behind him at the Kings Park end of   Hampden.<br> <br>Peter Latchford was a genuine character in an era when players were   encouraged to display their own distinctive personalities. For those of   us who remember the big man we will always do so with happy memory.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Becoming A Bhoy: Peter Latchford <br></h3>By: Laura Brannan on 21 Mar, 2012 09:32<br>Celticfc.net<br><br><b>Do you remember how the move to Celtic first came about?</b><br>Big  Jock was having a problem with his goalkeepers, he had Ally Hunter and  Denis Connaghan and I think Ally was having a crisis of confidence at  the time. I played for West Brom against Leeds, I was maybe about 21 or  22, with the youth team. It was a wet and windy day and I had a blinder.  Don Revie was there, I know that because I saw him, but I didn&rsquo;t think  anything of it. At that time I was out of the first-team and I had  already said to my manager, Don Howe, that I didn&rsquo;t want to play reserve  football. That&rsquo;s why I was in the youth team at that time, because I  had asked to play. I didn&rsquo;t want to sit around because in those days  there was nobody on the bench. If you weren&rsquo;t playing you were sitting  in the stand and that was no good to me. To cut a long story short, it&rsquo;s  not what you know, it&rsquo;s who you know and Jock Stein had phoned Don  Revie asking: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for a keeper, do you know any?&rdquo; He replied;  &ldquo;I might have the very guy&rdquo; &ndash; and the rest is history. <br>  <br> <b>What did you think when you heard it was Celtic who were interested in signing you?</b><br>The  gaffer called me up, it was a Friday morning and we were training. He  asked if I wanted to go out on loan and I said yes. He asked if I wanted  to know where I was going and I said it didn&rsquo;t matter. I asked if it  was for a first-team and he said yes so I said I would go. He smiled and  he said; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in this country. It&rsquo;s Celtic&hellip;up in Glasgow.&rdquo; I went  back out to training and got a hold of Bud Johnston, the ex-Rangers  player. I told him I had a chance to go Scotland and when I said it was  Celtic he couldn&rsquo;t believe how lucky I was. He told me to go and then  before I knew it the whole squad had heard about it within seconds and  they were all telling me to go as well. Bud told me I would love it and  then went on to tell me all the stories about Celtic and Rangers. I  think it was the next day, or the Monday, I jumped in the car and drove  up to Glasgow.<br>  <br> <b>What did you know about Celtic at that time?</b><br>Absolutely  nothing. Well that&rsquo;s not true, I knew who they were. I would watch the  Scottish football on a Saturday as you do, but apart from that I didn&rsquo;t  know much. I just wanted to play football, that&rsquo;s what it was all about.  I was so naive at the time and I had no idea what I was letting myself  in for.<br>  <b><br> You certainly know now though, have you since build a good affinity with the club?</b><br>Oh  yes, of course, you can&rsquo;t not have an affinity with a place you have  been working at for so long. I&rsquo;ve been with Celtic, on and off, for  about 35 years now, either playing or coaching and it&rsquo;s great, what else  would I want to do.<br>  <br> <b>Do you remember what the media reaction was to you signing for Celtic?</b><br>Disbelief  I think. I had already played for the England U23s before I came up to  Scotland and some people ask me if I felt coming up here enhanced my  chances of a cap even more &ndash; but I say it killed them. They can&rsquo;t look  that far north, they&rsquo;re struggling to get up to Newcastle, never mind  over the wall. I had no chance, going to Scotland was going the back of  beyond as far as folk in London were concerned. It&rsquo;s different now, but  even with that disadvantage at that time I still loved it. <br>  <br> <b>How much of a change was Celtic compared to what you were used to down south?</b><br>I  went from playing in front of about 12 people in a reserve game up to  playing at Hampden in front of 80,000 in cup finals. It was scary but as  I keep trying to explain to people, if you can&rsquo;t go and enjoy that then  you&rsquo;re in the wrong job. If someone says there are 100,000 fans out  there of course it&rsquo;s going to be scary, as in what happens if you make a  mistake? But they&rsquo;re not going to actually jump on you on the pitch.  You&rsquo;ll get hell for it in the shops and on the street but if you can&rsquo;t  go out and enjoy that occasion, and look forward to it then you  shouldn&rsquo;t be playing football at the top level. You have to deal with  that kind of pressure day in, day out at Celtic.<br> <br> <b>Was that the first time you had moved away from England and was it a daunting prospect?</b><br>I  was just married and when the loan deal was first signed I told my wife  I would be away the following week. She was really confused when I said  I was going up to Scotland but when I explained why I reassured her I  would only be there for three or four days then I would come home again.  So that became my routine - I used to come up on a Tuesday morning and I  would catch the first train back on the Saturday after the game. I  would train on the Monday morning with West Brom and back up again the  next day &ndash; unless there was a midweek game then I would just stay up. <br>  <br> <b>At what stage did you know the move was going to be made permanent?</b><br>I  didn&rsquo;t because when I left after the cup final, Big Jock didn&rsquo;t say  anything, he just asked if I&rsquo;d enjoyed my time. I said yes and he said:  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; He was then involved in that car crash so it was Sean  Fallon who actually signed me and it was a while before Jock came back  in.<br>  <br> <b>So at the end of the season did you think everything was just going to go back to normal? </b><br>Yes,  I was away back to West Brom, but I was absolutely delighted when  Celtic came back for me. They asked if I wanted to sign and I said yes  straight away. We had a change of manager at West Brom at that time and  he had told me I could go because he was going to be changing things  around so it was perfect for everyone.<br>  <br> <b>Did much change when the move became permanent? </b><br>Yes,  I got a house and I didn&rsquo;t have to go up and down on the train anymore &ndash;  there was a lot less travelling! It still took a good year to settle in  before we got a house. It was okay for me but it took a while for my  wife to settle down and make new friends. That part of your life takes a  while. As far as the club was concerned though, it was back to the same  old crowd for me, day in, day out, with the same lads.<br>  <br> <b>Are you happy with what you went on to achieve at Celtic or do you have any regrets?</b><br>I&rsquo;ve  no regrets but I would still have liked to have won a lot more and gone  further in Europe. The European games were one of these big factors  that helped me decide to come back because I knew we would be in the  Cup-Winners&rsquo; Cup. Apart from the money players get nowadays the only  thing I&rsquo;m jealous of is the number of times they get to play in Europe.  If we lost that first tie that was it. Although we played a lot of  friendlies against top European opposition at that time, the league  system they have now is great. Even watching the youngsters playing that  type of football in the NextGen Series is fantastic, I would have loved  that.<br>  <br> <b>And finally, what would you say was the highlight of your Celtic career?</b><br>Definitely  the 4-2 game against Rangers, that was some atmosphere. I try to  explain to folk the feelings when we went into the dressing room after  the final whistle and then to come back out to what seemed about 90,000  fans. I tell the young boys I work with now and they don&rsquo;t believe me,  they say; &ldquo;But the stadium only holds 60,000!&rdquo; Not in my day son, they  were all sitting around the track, it was great. Real Madrid away was a  great game, even though we lost, so was the home tie as well. I had a  great time at Celtic and worked with a great bunch of lads, we all  enjoyed ourselves which is what I wanted to do. <br></div></div>
