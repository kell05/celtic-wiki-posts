I appreciated what they did.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;I didn&#39;t feel I got that in my last six months with City.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;There was a small problem with the negotiations with City.<br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;There were too many discussions and not enough decisions, but I never felt I would not sign for Celtic.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;I had the full support from the gaffer, Gordon Strachan, and the board and I was sure everything would end up fine.&quot; </font><font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">He added: &quot;The gaffer stayed in touch with me.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;When  you see a club really wants you it makes a difference. You feel they  are on your side. When you feel you have that support it&#39;s enough.</font><font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;The new manager, Mark Hughes, arriving at City didn&#39;t affect me.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;My  decision was always to leave City. If Sven-Goran Eriksson was the  manager or someone else, I really didn&#39;t care. I wanted to leave the  club.&quot; Samaras is keen to play as often as possible for Celtic after  rarely getting a chance at City under Eriksson.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;It was not exactly that they did not want me. I just didn&#39;t play the games I wanted to play, &quot; said the 23-year-old.</font><font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;I was part of the team at City, but I wanted more games &ndash; and that&#39;s the reason I left.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;You must work hard because if you say &#39;they don&#39;t want me so I quit&#39; then your career will suffer. And that&#39;s no good.&quot; </font><font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">The  striker is now relishing the challenge of trying to take a top-team  jersey from last season&#39;s first-pick pairing of Jan Vennegoor of  Hesselink and Scott McDonald.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">Samaras  said: &quot;They had a great season and scored a lot of goals, but I am also  here now and I will try to make things harder for them.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;It will be good for all of us if it&#39;s competitive because you push yourself to be better and better.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;It&#39;s  not the best thing to go to a club in January, as you have only four  months and must show really quickly what you can do. You need to learn  about your coach, your team-mates and also the club while settling in  the city.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;I  was a little unsure because I was on loan, but now I&#39;m really excited  to have signed.&quot; Samaras insisted he will never reach for the panic  button, as he simply doesn&#39;t play the strain game.</font> <font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;This might sound weird, but I don&#39;t feel pressure. I don&#39;t suffer from stress, &quot; he said.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;The only thing I need is to go out there and enjoy the games and try and play attacking football, that&#39;s it.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">It&#39;s a game. My character is like this, but some other players may have another character and can&#39;t handle stress.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;I  know Barry Robson said something else and, of course, there is pressure  at a massive club because you always have to win and play attacking  football, or you have problems with the supporters and media.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;But some people can handle it differently from others.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;The pressure is there for everyone, but for me panic goes around my head. My only love is to play football.&quot; </font><font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">Samaras has already proved he is a winner by striking crucial goals on Celtic&#39;s march to last season&#39;s SPL title.</font><font face="Arial"> </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;I never give up. I always believe in myself and the team, &quot; he said.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;A lot of people gave up on us after we lost at home to Motherwell and said we had lost the league.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;But we showed great spirit and heart. You never know what will happen in football, what to expect.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;You get spirit and heart if you have some personalities in the dressing room who give you character.</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;Maybe other teams don&#39;t have that, but we do &ndash; and that&#39;s the reason we finished so well last year.&quot;</font> <font face="Arial"><br><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">(c) 2008 Express Newspapers </font><font color="#000000" face="Arial">The Daily Express</font> <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Stephen Halliday: Unable to stomach a lunchtime kick-off, Samaras may become Celtic&#39;s cup scapegoat</h3>  <div>  <div class="subheadline">  <h2>  Greek striker&#39;s future in doubt after being axed from midweek squad</h2></div>  <div>  </div></div><br><div class="viewarticlepanel">  <div class="multiimageoff">  <div>  <img alt="Samaras, Georgios - Kerrydale Street" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/Ek7KhKvODMywIIxe8oXm_Q799" title="Samaras, Georgios - Kerrydale Street"></div>The Scotsman   </div></div>  <div>  Published Date: 15 April 2010 </div>  <div class="byline">  By Stephen Halliday:<br><br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/spfl/samaras-will-leave-legacy-of-love-at-celtic-1-3394776?utm_medium=twitter&amp;utm_source=twitterfeed</div>IN  THE lingering fall-out to any seismic cup shock suffered by one of the  Old Firm clubs, there are invariably some of those involved who pay a  heavier price than others. History informs us they are usually  strikers.When Rangers lost to Berwick Rangers in the Scottish Cup in  1967, widely considered the greatest upset of all time in the tournament  until the past few days, forwards Jim Forrest and George McLean were  made the scapegoats and never played for the Ibrox club again.   <br><br>Just  ten years ago, Ian Wright was the front man quickly hunted out of town  when Celtic suffered their own previous Scottish Cup nadir at home to  Inverness Caledonian Thistle.<br><br>So when the team-sheets were issued  at Celtic Park on Tuesday night, it was easy to wonder if Georgios  Samaras is destined to be the man who carries the can for last  Saturday&#39;s convulsive semi-final defeat against First Division Ross  County at Hampden.<br><br>Neil Lennon not only dropped the Greek  international striker, who had started all three previous matches since  the interim manager replaced Tony Mowbray, but did not even name him  among the substitutes. German right-back Andreas Hinkel suffered the  same fate and watched Celtic&#39;s gritty if unspectacular 2-1 victory over  Motherwell from the stand.<br><br>Lennon insisted afterwards that no-one  had been specifically targeted for their part in the weekend debacle,  saying: &quot;They are still part of the squad. I had to pick a team to win  the game. It could have been anybody. Don&#39;t forget you have three  under-21s to pick as well so sometimes you have international players in  the stand.&quot;<br><br>The Ulsterman also made it clear, however, that he  felt no need to offer any form of explanation to the players he had left  out and Samaras may find it difficult to force his way back into the  side. All in all, it was an unfortunate evening for the 25-year-old.<br><br>The  curse of matchday programme printing deadlines saw Samaras adorn the  front cover for Motherwell&#39;s visit and occupy the main inside pages with  a lengthy feature article and poster. In an interview clearly conducted  before Saturday&#39;s early afternoon humiliation against Ross County,  Samaras informed the Celtic supporters of his distaste for the lunchtime  kick-offs which are prevalent in Scottish football. It is something  they had probably discerned already from his feckless weekend display at  Hampden.<br><br>&quot;I prefer to play night time games,&quot; said Samaras.  &quot;It&#39;s better than waking up at eight o&#39;clock in the morning and you have  to get out for a 12 o&#39;clock kick-off. I&#39;ve been here three years so  it&#39;s not as bad now, but at the start I thought to myself &#39;that&#39;s not  possible&#39;. You can do it maybe three or four times a year, like I did  when I was at Manchester City, but not every weekend.<br><br>&quot;In  Holland, the games are always at night time, just like in Greece with  the national team. Your build-up for a game is better, and more  relaxing, for a night time game rather than a 12.30pm kick-off. I think  most of the players agree with me.&quot;<br><br>With Celtic&#39;s next two  matches against Hibs and Dundee United both having 12.15 kick-offs, it  would perhaps be wise not to bet on a quick recall to the starting  line-up for Samaras.<br><br>Yet it sums up the enigmatic nature of the  former Heerenveen player that after his first match in charge of Celtic  three weeks ago, the 3-1 defeat of Kilmarnock, Lennon was moved to heap  praise on Samaras, stating that he &quot;was the best I&#39;ve seen him&quot;.<br><br>But  talent and ability has seldom been an issue in appraising Samaras.  Application and consistency are a different matter. He has been an  endlessly frustrating figure in the eyes of the Celtic support since  Gordon Strachan recruited him, initially on loan at the end of the  2007-08 title-winning season and then on a permanent three-year  contract.<br><br>There were spells during this season, notably around  November and December, when he appeared capable of being a hugely  influential figure in Mowbray&#39;s bid to shape Celtic in a manner both  attractive and successful. Samaras scored six goals in five matches  during one especially purple patch before fading badly.<br><br>His  overall strike rate of 37 goals in 98 games for Celtic is more than  decent, but his recent return of just one goal in his last 14  appearances certainly vindicates his omission by Lennon.<br><br>Irrespective  of whether he plays for Celtic again this season, Samaras is almost  certain to be on the biggest stage of them all this summer. His place in  the Greece squad for the World Cup finals in South Africa is highly  unlikely to be threatened by events at Celtic. Greek coach Otto Rehhagel  holds Samaras in high regard, having played him in ten of the 12  qualifiers played to reach the finals.<br><br>It was a sumptuous pass  from Samaras which created the goal from Dimitrios Salpingidis to defeat  Ukraine in Donetsk in November in the play-offs, just another example  of the player&#39;s fine technical gifts.<br><br>With Lennon making clear  the need for major surgery on the Celtic first team squad this summer,  it remains to be seen whether Samaras will be one of those off-loaded.  He is under contract until 2011, but a good World Cup may attract  suitors. <br><br>Just don&#39;t expect clubs from countries where fixtures kick-off at lunchtime to be among them.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Samaras: We want to repay &#39;unbelievable&#39; fans</h3><font size="2">By: Mark Henderson on 04 Mar, 2011 13:36   <br><br>DURING  Celtic&rsquo;s recent 3-0 win over Rangers, Georgios Samaras did something he  had never done before when involved in a game of football. Kris Commons  had just struck the Hoops&rsquo; third goal of the game in the 70th minute  and the ball was at the other end of the field from the Greek striker. <br><br>Normally  that wouldn&rsquo;t have made any difference to his focus on the match but  such were the scenes around him, he found himself pausing for a few  seconds and transferring his gaze away from the action to survey what  was happening in the stands around him. <br><br>What greeted him was a  sight and a sound he has never experienced in his career, as the entire  home support jumped up and down in jubilation before embarking on an  impromptu mass huddle. <br><br>It was just another reminder to Samaras  about how special a club Celtic are, and he insisted that this kind of  backing would inspire the whole team to deliver some silverware at the  end of the season. <br><br>&ldquo;This is my fourth season here at Celtic and I  have to say that was the best atmosphere I have ever seen in my life,&rdquo;  he told the matchday programme in an exclusive interview. &ldquo;It was even  better than Champions League nights. It was something unbelievable. <br><br>&ldquo;To  be honest, it wasn&rsquo;t just me as I chatted with some of my team-mates  after the game about it. I caught myself for a few seconds in the game  just looking at them instead of the game. I was like &lsquo;What&rsquo;s going on  here&rsquo;. <br><br>&ldquo;The ball was down the other side and I was looking  around me. Normally, I never do that as I stay focused on the game, even  if the atmosphere is good or bad. But it was the only time in my life  that the crowd just struck me. It was unbelievable. I saw some clips on  YouTube later on and they were even better. <br><br>&ldquo;To see 50,000  people doing a big huddle and jumping up and down in the stands - I have  never seen anything like that in my life. <br><br>&ldquo;You might see it in  Greece, Spain or Italy where you have the Tifosi &ndash; the really fanatic  fans who sing from the first to the last minute. But this was the whole  stadium. <br><br>&ldquo;We, the football players, know that and everybody  knows how special a club this is, and we&#39;re all working really hard to  bring some success and win some trophies again &ndash; something we didn&rsquo;t do  last year. <br><br>&ldquo;And the supporters must realise how big they can be  and how much they can help us, not just in derby games. I know it&rsquo;s not  possible every week but I hope they can be with us in every game and we  can do it on the pitch for them.&rdquo;</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Samaras  </h3>Written by St Anthony <br>Thursday, 04 October 2012 18:41<br>From Celtic Underground<br><br>Source:   http://www.celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=963%3Ahow-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-samaras&amp;catid=49%3Aseason-2012-2013&amp;Itemid=85&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter<br><br>Regular  readers to this site (there may very well be one or two) may recall  this article I wrote 15 months ago regarding Georgios Samaras.<br><br>After  last night&rsquo;s dramatic win in Moscow Eddie Pearson contacted me to ask  if I was a fan of Samaras&rsquo; yet. And the answer is..&hellip;&hellip;.yes.<br><br>During  the summer a friend remarked to me that Celtic needed a big striker up  front who had pace and, preferably, a shot like a cannon. My reply to  him was that we already had a player like that at Parkhead &ndash; Samaras. He  has everything in his locker a striker requires and ideally the team  should be built around his talents but it&rsquo;s not only me who felt that  there was something missing in the big guy&rsquo;s make up.<br><br><br>There&rsquo;s  no doubt big Geo splits the Celtic support. It reminds me of the way my  Dad used to describe Big Yogi, John Hughes, when I was younger &ndash; &lsquo;Half  the crowd used to swear by him and the other half swore at him&rsquo;. And yet  despite all the criticism thrown his way you cannot doubt that Samaras  has talent.<br><br>Neil Lennon described the seven week summer spell  between the initial draw against Helsinki and victory over Helsingborgs  as &lsquo;a living hell.&rsquo; I know what he means. Normally a draw against  Finnish and Swedish opposition would see Celtic fancy their chances but  with recent Euro disasters fresh in the memory, and an inexperienced  side, confidence wasn&rsquo;t exactly high.<br><br>I can recall the night at  Parkhead when Helsinki took the lead and I have to say I thought the  worst. However, the team showed great spirit to recover and take a 2-1  lead to Finland. In both away legs in Scandinavia Samaras scored vital  goals and showed his experience in a young Celtic team. Qualification  was a major achievement given the financial constraints we face in the  SPL. In those four qualifying matches I rated Samaras as Celtic&rsquo;s best  player. The relief felt by Lennon (and the fans) was enormous and it  remained to be seen how the young Celts would fare in the group stages.<br><br>In  Moscow Samaras played well and helped to hold the shape of the team by  keeping his position out wide on the left. In the final seconds he  attacked Izzaguirre&rsquo;s cross and headed home a glorious winner as  watching Celtic fans all over the world let out exclamations of joy. At  last big Sammi had showed us what he was capable of and showed a bit of  heart into the bargain.<br><br>The win against Spartak was Celtic&rsquo;s best  in many years. Perhaps the most impressive thing is that this team does  not rely heavily on one individual, such as a Larsson or a Nakamura, as  we have tended to do in the past. This is a side who look solid in  every area and have players on the bench who can come on and change a  game.<br><br>So well done to Georgios Samaras on leading the Celtic  charge in Europe. Whatever happens now, and we all hope for the very  best, the big man has made a considerable impact. Hopefully the  confidence he will gain from these goals will help him carry on the good  form for the rest of the season.<br><br>There are some reading this who will be surprised at my sentiments. Well done Georgios. I am so proud you are a Celt.<br>Last Updated on Thursday, 04 October 2012 18:48  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>Hellas and back: The renaissance of Georgios Samaras</h3>The Scotsman<br><br>By ANDREW SMITH<br>Published on Sunday 18 November 2012 00:00<br><br>THERE  was a time that mentioning Georgios Samaras in the same sentence as  Henrik Larsson would have had Celtic-supporting lynch mobs beating a  path to your door.<br><br>The fifth away European tie of the season for  Neil Lennon&rsquo;s side, which pits them against Benfica in a potentially  momentous Champions League group game on Tuesday, demands comparison  between the pair. It does so by dint of the fact it presents the Greek  with an opportunity to usurp the great Swede.<br><br>Samaras, with the  help of a couple of kindly deflections, has been credited with goals in  every one of Celtic&rsquo;s on-the-road assignments in the past four months.  Not since Larsson did so in earliest rounds of two UEFA Cup tilts  between 1998 and 1999, has a player at the club scored in four straight  European away games. Celtic&rsquo;s peerless goal plunderer of recent times  couldn&rsquo;t make it five. Neither, for that matter has any other player at  the club. If Samaras does so in two days, there is every chance it will  be part of all sorts of history &ndash; owing to the fact that a win for  Barcelona in their game at Spartak Moscow earlier on Tuesday evening  would allow Celtic to progress for the last 16 were they to snatch a  score draw in Lisbon&rsquo;s Stadium of Light.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s agm last week  inevitably reminded of the comment from Lennon at the previous year&rsquo;s  shareholder gathering when he said the insouciant character was the sort  of player &ldquo;who could get me the sack&rdquo; on being harangued about his  continued selection of Samaras as Celtic struggled to keep pace with  Rangers. A year on the Celtic manager was able to point to that league  being won because of the rangy performer&rsquo;s ability to &ldquo;play teams on his  own at times&rdquo;. A &ldquo;long and frank chat&rdquo; two years ago cleared the air  between the pair, Lennon recalled, and was the first step towards  Samaras being able to play in an atmosphere not polluted by boos from  his own fans. Made captain for the win over Barcelona, in part as  appreciation from Lennon for having struggled back from an ankle injury  while not fully fit, the 27-year-old was given a standing ovation as he  left the pitch. No player in Celtic&rsquo;s history has every completed such a  spectacular turnaround in the followers&rsquo; affections.<br><br>&ldquo;For me  that speaks volumes for him as a person,&rdquo; said Lennon. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any  doubt about his talent but it was just about his consistency, which he  has found now. Now, he&rsquo;s never been prolific, we know that, but he  weighs in with important goals at times and brings something to the team  that others don&rsquo;t. Particularly in Europe, where he is very, very  important to the way we play.<br><br>&ldquo;This season has been pretty  stop-start with injury. He had the elbow injury when he was away with  Greece then we got him back in for the Moscow game. He didn&rsquo;t play great  because it was his first game for two or three weeks but we know we  will get something out of him [and he scored the winner]. He has  definitely become more consistent. I think the players respect him, what  he did in the Euros, what he has done for us in Europe, what he has  done for us domestically.&rdquo;<br><br>And what he wants to continue doing,  Samaras has shown no desire to move away even when there seemed 50,000  Celtic supporters who would have personally driven him all the way to  Azerbaijan if he&rsquo;d found a club there. &ldquo;He loves it here,&rdquo; said Lennon.  &ldquo;He loves the club, and the supporters have really taken to him now.  When he&rsquo;s fully fit and flowing, he&rsquo;s a tremendous player. He&rsquo;s a very  intelligent boy, a great professional, and he&rsquo;s never given me one day&rsquo;s  problem.&rdquo;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  Samaras: my motivation is more medals, not money</h3>Monday 22 April 2013<br>The Herald<br><br>Georgios Samaras has revealed his motivation at Celtic continues to be medals and not money.<br><br>The  Greece international came on as substitute against Inverness at  Parkhead yesterday and scored a superb fourth goal in the 4-1 win which  clinched the Clydesdale Bank Premier League title.<br><br>With skipper  Scott Brown sitting in the stand recovering from surgery to solve an  abductor problem, Samaras was the longest-serving Celtic player on the  pitch when the final whistle confirmed his third SPL championship medal.<br><br>The  28-year-old forward, who signed from Manchester City in July, 2008  following a loan spell at the club, also has a League Cup winners medal  and gets the chance to win his second Scottish Cup when Celtic take on  Hibernian in the final of the William Hill Scottish Cup next month.<br><br>As  he reflected on his time at Parkhead while also looking to the future,  Samaras claimed &quot;winning games and titles&quot; was what kept him going.<br><br>&quot;I play football because I love it,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I want to have great memories when I have retired.<br><br>&quot;These memories are about winning games and trophies, not the money.<br><br>&quot;I love this club. I have been here six years and I feel that I have more to give.<br><br>&quot;I am 28 and I do not know how long I will play football, maybe seven or eight years, maybe 10 years, maybe 12.<br><br>&quot;I like to live my life in the now. I do not know what will happen in the future.<br><br>&quot;I feel nice at this club so we will see what happens.&quot;<br><br>Samaras  joked when asked if longevity in the game could equal that of Ryan  Giggs, who is still turning out for Manchester United at the age of 39.<br><br>He said: &quot;He is a legend. He is one of the best players in European football in the last 20 years.<br><br>&quot;But I cannot see the future. I do not have this special power...yet.<br><br>&quot;It is nice to live in the now and wait to see what happens in the future.&quot;<br><br>Former  Celtic striker Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink recently claimed Samaras was  on his way to becoming Mr Celtic but he believes that accolade belongs  to Brown.<br><br>&quot;I think Broony is Mr Celtic,&quot; he said. &quot;He came here six months earlier than me.<br><br>&quot;It was great to hear those words from a great player like Jan, a great man as well.<br><br>&quot;I really appreciate what he said because I respect him.<br><br>&quot;But I think this club already has a great leader in Broony.<br><br>&quot;We all look up to him. In Scotland, the captain has to be Scottish.<br><br>&quot;Broony is perfect for this role. I cannot see anyone replacing him in this position.&quot;<br><br>Despite  the absence of traditional rivals Rangers from the SPL this season,  Samaras insists this season&#39;s title win did not elicit a different  feeling.<br><br>&quot;No, the same,&quot; said the former Heerenveen player. &quot;It has been a tough season. It is not easy to win games and win titles.<br><br>&quot;It is about 20-25 players working hard, helping each other. If you play and do well, that is good.<br><br>&quot;If you look at the whole campaign, we deserved to win the league. Fifteen points is a big difference.<br><br>&quot;We focused more on the Champions League and the start of the season so we were a bit flat then.<br><br>&quot;But we deserved to win the title.&quot;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><span class="diffRemove">  </span><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Samaras will leave legacy of love at Celtic</span><span class="diffRemove">Georgios Samaras has recently passed 250 appearances for Celtic.
