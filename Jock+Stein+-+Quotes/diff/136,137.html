Sometimes we are inclined to forget that. The only chance of bringing them into stadiums is if they are entertained by what happens on the football field.&quot; <br><b>Jock Stein</b> <br><br>&quot;It hasn&rsquo;t been the money that has kept me at Celtic Park. I&rsquo;ve done what I&rsquo;ve done out of a kind of passion &hellip; See, Celtic have been wonderful to me. You&rsquo;ve heard of people being brought back from the dead? Well it was Celtic that brought me back from the dead.&quot;<br><b>Jock Stein<br></b><br>&ldquo;Cups are not won by individuals, but by men in a team who put their club before personal prestige.&rdquo;<br><b>Jock Stein before Lisbon 67 </b><br><font color="#333333"><br>&quot;My proudest moment? Every Friday morning when I look at the board at Celtic Park and see my name on the team sheet for tomorrow&rsquo;s game.&quot;<br></font><b><font color="#333333">Jock Stein (when a Celtic player &amp; team captain)<br></font></b><br>&quot;Nobody wants to know what the manager is saying. The team said it all on the park.&quot;<br><b>Jock Stein</b> <br><br>&quot;We like to think that whoever we play, we are a football team, nothing more. We are a football team who will play anyone from anywhere, from any walk of life, from any religion, from any creed. That is Celtic Football Club.&quot;<br><b>Jock Stein</b><br><br>&ldquo;Unlike many other Celts, I cannot claim that Celtic was my first love &hellip; but I can say that it will be my last love.&rdquo;<br><b>Jock Stein in a speech at a Supporters night in 1955<br></b><br><font color="#000000">&quot;If I can achieve for Celtic what I have achieved for Hibs, then I feel I will have done well for them.&quot;</font><br><b><font color="#000000">Jock Stein on becoming Celtic manager, possibly his only understated remark!<br></font></b><br>&quot;The secret of being a good manager is to keep the six players who hate you away from the five who are undecided.&quot; <br><b>Jock Stein<br></b><br><font color="#000000">&quot;I enjoy being manager here, because I like the people who support us.&quot;</font><br><b>Jock Stein</b><br><br><font color="#000000">&quot;Celtic jerseys are not for second best, they don&#39;t shrink to fit inferior players&quot; </font><br><b>Jock Stein</b><br><br><font color="#000000">&ldquo;I&#39;d far rather talk about players, they are the people who make things happen.&ldquo;</font><br><b>Jock Stein<br><br></b><font color="#000000">&ldquo;You&#39;re too fond of Charlie Gallagher and Harry Hood. You wouldn&#39;t win a league with 11 Charlie Gallaghers or Harry Hoods.&ldquo;</font><br><b>Jock Stein<br><br></b><font color="#000000">&quot;There is no substitute for experience &quot;</font><br><b>Jock Stein<br><br></b><font color="#000000">&quot;Have the first issue ready for the week after the [Scottish] Cup Final and leave a blank space on page one for a picture of the boys with the Cup!&quot;</font><i><br></i><b><font color="#000000">Jock Stein on the new &quot;Celtic View&quot; in his first season as manager</font></b><i><br></i><br><font color="#000000">&quot;I think it is important to win a match, but I think what is even more important is the manner in which you win.&quot;</font><br><b>Jock Stein</b><br><br><font color="#000000">&quot;The most pleasure any manager can get is seeing everyday boys joining the Club as youngsters and growing into men and giving themselves a better social standing than they could ever have dreamed of previously.&quot;</font><br><b>Jock Stein<br><br></b>&quot;You go down that pit shaft, a mile underground. You can&rsquo;t see a thing. The guy next to you, you don&rsquo;t know who he is. Yet he is the best friend you will ever have.&quot; <br><b>Jock Stein on the miners</b><br><b><br><font color="#000000">(Before a European Cup game to Hunter Davies (an English Journalist) touring round Celtic and Rangers grounds who was commenting on Celtic&#39;s unpretentious surroundings compared to Rangers more &quot;cathedral-like stadium&quot;)</font></b><br><font color="#000000">&quot;Ach, Rangers are alright, but they still haven&#39;t invented blue grass.&quot;</font><br><br><font color="#000000">&ldquo;25% of our [Celtic&rsquo;s] managers have been Protestant!&rdquo;</font><br><b><font color="#000000">Jock Stein on being appointed manager of Celtic, when pointed out with headlines in the papers and by people that he was the first Protestant manager of Celtic (he was only the 4th in the clubs history (retold by Hugh McIlvaney)) </font><br></b><br><font color="#000000">&ldquo;Is it alright if he&rsquo;s very cheeky that ah can skelp &lsquo;em?&rdquo;</font><br><b><font color="#000000">Jock Stein jokingly to Billy McNeil&rsquo;s family as he convinced them to let him sign for Celtic (as told by Billy McNeil) </font><br></b><i><br></i><font color="#000000">&ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t Orange but we were staunch!&rdquo; </font><br><b><font color="#000000">Jock Stein on his family background to Hugh McIlvaney </font><br><font color="#000000">(from BBC life story program on Jock Stein 20</font><font color="#000000">07) </font><br></b><br><font color="#000000">&quot;If they were interested in what I had to say they would get here in time.

Along come the hacks and Jock starts, just loud enough for them to hear. &#39;Here&#39;s such and such coming, big gambler . . . this one&#39;s having it off with so-and-so&#39;.

He would never take the praise himself. It was always about the players and how great the team were. That magnanimity tells you everything about him.

He looked at them, and said: &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;re proud of yourselves. You&rsquo;re doing people out of a living.&rsquo; None of them said a word. Then he said to me: &lsquo;This is an absolute bloody disgrace. You go down that pit shaft, a mile underground. You can&rsquo;t see a thing. The guy next to you, you don&rsquo;t know who he is.
