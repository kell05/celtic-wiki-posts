Despite being the head of the European  Coaches Union, a member of FIFA&#39;s technical committee at France &#39;98, and despite having coached Czechoslovakia to European Championship success 1976 and  the quarter finals of the World Cup at Italia &#39;90, very few Celtic fans  knew a great deal about him. <br><br>The dignified Slovak had also  coached at such clubs as Sporting Lisbon, Aston Villa, and Fenerbahce,  but this counted for nothing as far as the press were concerned. He had a  hard act to follow, and many fans were irate at the time it took to  land the new man. <br><br>All the indications before his appointment  were that Venglos was not the first choice. It appears that that  distinction belonged to Egil Olsen, who initially agreed to take the job  but then backed out for reasons which are still not entirely clear.  Egil Olsen has claimed it was due to the 3 month quarantine rules for  his dog, and he couldn&#39;t do it! Daft idiot, and looks like we got a  lucky escape as his previous role was as Norway manager which saw that  side play the long ball game to the letter (very dull football) and his  career afterwards was nothing much to write home about.<br><br>Hampered  by the lateness of his own appointment, a severe injury crisis  (exacerbated by the World Cup), a bonus row, and a much delayed entry  into the transfer market, Venglos got off to a worryingly poor start.  Only three of the first ten league matches were won, the team made an  ignominious early exit from the League Cup, and after failing to qualify  for the Champions League, matters reached a head on 3 November 1998  with the disastrous loss to Zurich in the UEFA Cup. <br><br>One  immediate casualty was General Manager Jock Brown, but Venglos&#39; own job  was hanging by a thread when Celtic faced Rangers at Parkhead on 21  November. Strengthened by the signings of Riseth, Mjallby and Moravcik,  Venglos&#39; team responded with an unforgettable 5-1 thrashing of Rangers,  which went down in history as &quot;The Humping!&quot;. That gave Venglos much  needed breathing space and results gradually improved. The support was  very much behind him now and grew to love him.<br><br>A major setback  occurred when the long-sought after new striker, Mark Viduka, went AWOL  immediately after completing his transfer, and the team promptly lost  2-1 to Hearts at Tynecastle. After the winter break, Celtic began to  play some of the most exhilarating football seen in years, with Larsson  in stupendous form. Notably, it was Venglos who converted Larsson into  the free-run central striker that was to make him a legend. Some would  argue it was more Venglos than even Jansen who really set off Larsson  onto the road to greatness.<br><br>The biggest problem for Venglos was  to turn around the team having started late in his job. When he brought  in players, they could be sublime (Lubo and even the much maligned  Viduka) but other players need time to bed in, and he had no lengthy  pre-season to settle the squad of players and embed some tactics into  their general play. There were numerous great performances through the  season and we racked up high scores against many sides, such as a 7-1  win over Motherwell and a 5-1 win over Aberdeen, so it was highly  entertaining to watch. <br><br>However, at the end, it was always asking  a lot to make up the lost ground in the title race, and the challenge  faltered on 24 April with a 1-0 defeat by St Johnstone which brought a  long healthy run of performances to an end.<br><br>The league title was  conceded in traumatic circumstances at Parkhead on 2 May in a  controversial match v Rangers which was lost 3-0. The shocking  performance by the referee (Hugh Dallas) was overshadowed by his being  coined by an idiot supporter. That incident took the focus off of what  was a bad refereeing performance onto our support, and the referee and  Rangers got away with it.<br><br>The Scottish Cup remained the sole hope  of consolation but in the final against Rangers, a much criticised team  selection failed to rise to the occasion, giving an insipid performance  which left many muttering darkly about the Head Coach&#39;s future. <br><br>Must  add about the treatment met out to him by the press. Venglos was quite a  placid gentleman in comparison to his counterpart at Rangers, yet he  was the one being personally attacked and mocked too often. It was a  slight on the state of Scottish football and journalism the way that  Venglos was treated. <br><br>On signing Lubo, the amount of mockery that was  aimed at him was ridiculous with media commentators ignorant on the  player and using his transfer as a way to take cheapshots at Venglos.  How Lubo proved them wrong, but the underlying media attacks on Venglos  should not after be brushed under the carpet. <br><br>Venglos was simply  done by this point and had to handle too much. He did state that he  wanted to continue but it was best that he stepped down for his own  sake. <br><br>It says much for the genuine esteem in which Venglos was  held that he was able to retain much of his dignity even after the new  management team of Kenny Dalglish and John Barnes was installed a short  while later. Venglos retained employment at Celtic, moving to the newly  created post of European Technical Advisor, however nobody seems to know  what he actually did in this role for the club in later years. The  position was likely nominal and given out of respect.<br><br>Most of the  circumstances surrounding his season in charge were unfortunate, but  many had felt at the outset that he was never really the man for the  long-run for this most demanding of jobs given his age. In truth, he  wasn&#39;t a man to stick around. In around a 32 year period he had been  involved with numerous different clubs &amp; international sides. So it wasn&#39;t necessarily just  age which was to possibly stop him from carrying on, as his history  showed he was one to like to move around. <br><br>Regardless, he was highly  respected by Chairman Fergus McCann (who was not an easy man to please  for team managers), and McCann stated that Venglos was the manager he  worked with that he favoured the most (and McCann worked with far more  than he should have in his own short tenure).<br><br>The Celtic support all grew to respect Venglos a great deal and hoped him the very best.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3"

welcome on Jozef Venglos&#39; appointment in July 1998</b><br><br>&quot;I  see myself as a coach not a diplomat. You have to realise I am a new  coach and this is a new atmosphere. When you are a coach you always hope  to find a good dressing-room. The players are doing their duties very  well.&quot;<b><br>Jo Venglos (on questioning by media over player bonus wrangles)</b><br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want to mix up one game with another. When you go to the market, apples are apples and plums are plums.&quot;<br><b>Jo Venglos (1999)</b><br><br>&ldquo;In  my position, I watch a lot of European games and study them. I look at  the tactics, psychology and pattern of play. But when Celtic play I act  more like a fan. I was impressed by their tactics against Barcelona, but  during the game I didn&rsquo;t act like a neutral. Afterwards, I looked at  what happened in greater detail. But when the game was on, I kept my  fingers crossed for everyone at Celtic. I have such a strong attachment  to the club and it&rsquo;s impossible not to feel passionate about Celtic when  I watch the team. Most of the time, I watch European games as a coach.  But when Celtic play, I am like any other fan.&rdquo; <br><b>Jo Venglos in interview with the Sun (Dec 2012)</b><br><br>&quot;What  a smashing guy he is, I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again, he is  the finest man I haver ever met in my life. That&#39;s quite an accolade.  The most decent, honourable, full of integrity, warm, friendly,  supportive.&quot;<br><b>Jock Brown (Celtic General manager) on Jo Venglos CU Podcast 210 (2014)<br></b><br>&quot;He should not have been the manager, I&#39;m not convinced he was the  manager, his name was the manager but I&#39;m not convinced he was picking  the team.&quot;<br><b>Mark Burchill on Venglos</b><br><b>  </b><b>  </b><b>  </b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div>
