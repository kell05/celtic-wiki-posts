We all wanted him to develop and mature into something special. People of KDS we got our wish. I give you Aiden McGeady, Kerrydale Street Player of the Year.<br>There were times during the season when Aiden was simply unplayable. The domination in Europe with the Benfica game and the mesmerizing display he put on against Aberdeen were performances players dream of in a lifetime of playing the game. Yet Aiden delivered those days and many more. He was consistently our creative force, his trickery refined to yield an end product, his physique and pace improved through a tough off season workout program and important goals rounding out his game. We have been lucky enough to witness the growth of a huge talent on our own turf. Before the adoring eyes of Celtic Park he has taken his skill and combined it with hard work and coaching to emerge as a true superstar.<br>There were times when it seemed Celtic had stalled during a game and the fans and players always looked to Aiden to provide that spark, rarely did he disappoint.<br>There were times the kids in the youth setup wanted to learn an Aiden move and the coaches complied rewarding them for their skill. There will be plenty more kids doing exactly that in the future!<br>There were times when Aiden got the ball and Paradise fizzled with expectation. As the season went on it became EVERY time we got the ball to him.<br>There were many full backs going without sleep on a Friday night knowing that next day there was a definite possibility that Aiden was going to make them look stupid. Then do it again. And again. And again.<br>I have no doubt that Aiden&rsquo;s future will involve playing at the very highest level but for now the Celtic fans need do nothing more than appreciate the best home grown talent of this generation.<br>Mikebhoy: &ldquo;McGeady is not a winger, and never has been.

He has set the bar very high though, and Aiden failed to come close to the impact Maloney made. I hope just Aiden has more competition this season because he is never consistent enough to hold down a first team place.&rdquo;<br>Bobbybhoy: &ldquo;I think the number of MOTM&#39;s he got from some people last season were just for having his name on the team-sheet. Give me an example of one scintillating display over 90 minutes by McGeady last season. You&#39;ll struggle. Tricks and flicks aren&#39;t enough, IMO&rdquo;<br>Djr: &ldquo;I do not see him being a first choice pick this coming season but being used a lot as a sub to turn games or change of tactics UNLESS he can stamp authority on EVERY game he get&rdquo;<br>WalfridsDream: &ldquo;When he starts he is rarely consistent and is too easily bullied off the ball. He is far more effective coming off the bench when teams tire in the last 30 mins. Until he gets stronger I would use him mostly this way<br>Jimmy_mac &ndash; &ldquo;McGeady won out due to some of the best individual moments that I&#39;ve seen at CP in a while (Benfica, Barca, Aberdeen!)&rdquo;<br>Tiger_whoods: &ldquo;McGeady finally arrived this year and we got i would say great performances early on until he started getting double and triple teamed, make no mistake more protection for him and he WOULD be world class&rdquo;<br>Madtim1967: &ldquo;every player has their price, altho in Mcgeadys instance I would hate if the club sold him anytime soon. Hes only gonna get better too . Must keep him for a few years yet&rdquo;<br>Hybrid_moments: &ldquo;I wouldn&#39;t take &pound;15m for him. He&#39;s the only player who has entertained more or less throughout the year really. Could you imagine how dour Celtic would have been to watch without him this season?&rdquo;<br>Nacho Novo: &ldquo;I don&#39;t know what happened there. I had him (Aiden) in my back pocket probably. But I didn&#39;t tell him that. It&#39;s not a problem. For me, nothing happened. It was a football game and these things happen&rdquo;<br>Desmodobhoy: &ldquo;football is about entertaining, and thats what Aiden is best at&rdquo;<br>StefMcDef: &ldquo;Inside, outside, over the top, for pace, tracking back, putting in tackles, leathering in stinging shots near the end, putting in crosses, scoring the winner.
