Johansen is going to be excellent for us and giving Stokes a partner brings out the best in him! Pitch invasion a bit daft though would never have happened if that arsehole steward had just let Brooney clap the fans. <br><br>(Quiet Assasisn of KDS)<br><br>The first half was poor. Some delightful football in the second. Was chuffed as hell for Henderson getting his goal. And Johansen trying to protest his innocence after practically vaulting into the North Stand :lol: Got to say though, left a wee but disappointed at the end. The pitch invasion was harmless but it really wasn&#39;t needed. The way Thistle seemed to be dictating things was rather bizarre. Both teams will leave as normal but the Celtic team will return? The team seemed to want to go to the stand right away :ponder: The tone of the announcement that the Celtic team would not return smacked of a Primary School teacher telling unruly weans off. It was pathetic. The crowd was perfectly under control at that point. Also in the first half stewards were confiscating banners from folk who had them hanging over the hoardings instead of just telling them to put them away. Pretty pathetic. It has to be said though, the first wee guy on the park was hilarious. Benny Hill stuff at times with him and stewards falling all over the show. :lol: Some absolutely cracking goals and great to have two so late. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Partick Thistle</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    12  Gallacher         </li><li>    02  O&#39;Donnell         </li><li>    03  Taylor-Sinclair         </li><li>    22  Fraser         </li><li>    13  Gabriel         </li><li>    15  Mair         </li><li>    28  Erskine      (Elliott - 63&#39;

The Scotsman<br><br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport<br><br>Updated on the 27 March<br>2014<br>01:23<br><br>Published 26/03/2014 21:46<br><br>125 comments<br>Print this<br><br>IT HAS been both completely predictable and utterly inevitable ever since they kicked off their campaign at the beginning of August. But nothing could diminish either the joy or the sense of satisfaction experienced by Neil Lennon, his players and the Celtic supporters as they clinched the inaugural SPFL Premiership title last night.<br><br>SCORERS: Partick: Elliott (85); Celtic: Stokes (3, 90); Henderson (49), Johansen (53), Commons (90)<br><br>Champions of Scotland for the 45th time, they have passed the finishing line with seven games to spare. It is the quickest the title has been secured since 1929, when Rangers wrapped it up with eight games remaining.<br><br>With a third consecutive championship under Lennon&rsquo;s guidance, Celtic are currently the undisputed and largely unchallenged superpower of Scottish football. As their fans struck up chants asking for &ldquo;ten in a row&rdquo;, it is certainly difficult to envisage their dominance being threatened any time soon.<br><br>Against a Partick Thistle side who remain just two points above the relegation play-off spot, Celtic were set on their way to victory by Anthony Stokes&rsquo; third-minute opener. It was not until the second half that the champions fully hit their stride, 17-year-old substitute Liam Henderson and Stefan Johansen scoring to put them firmly in command.<br><br>Christie Elliott pulled one back for Thistle with five minutes remaining, but Celtic added flourish to their coronation with two goals in stoppage time by Stokes and Kris Commons. The only sour note came after the final whistle when a pitch invasion by around 200 of their fans led to a planned players&rsquo; lap of honour being cancelled.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s rapid retention of the title had appeared assured when Stokes provided them with their early breakthrough. Thistle were simply caught cold by the pace and urgency of Celtic&rsquo;s start to the match, their defending at the goal far too ponderous. Emilio Izaguirre galloped into space down the left, the Honduran full-back cutting inside to loft over a cross with his notionally weaker right foot towards the far post. With the home defence caught flat-footed, Stokes barely had to raise himself off the ground to guide a looping header beyond Paul Gallacher from close range.<br><br>So dominant was Celtic&rsquo;s opening to the match, there was an immediate expectation they would waste little time in increasing their lead. But they gradually lost that fluency, while in contrast their hosts began to grow into the contest.<br><br>There was encouragement for the Thistle fans when, in a better spell of play by their favourites, Prince Buaben managed their first attempt on target, his shot charged down by the Celtic defence. With full-backs Stephen O&rsquo;Donnell and Aaron Taylor-Sinclair both willing to surge forward at every opportunity, it was Thistle who started to enjoy some attacking momentum.<br><br>They lacked the incisiveness in and around the penalty area to test Fraser Forster, but they were unsettling the Celtic defenders. When Efe Ambrose was dispossessed by Lyle Taylor while dwelling on the ball, Charlie Mulgrew had little option but to bring the striker down on the edge of the penalty area, earning a booking in the process. Kallum Higginbotham stepped forward to take the free kick, but his low effort went wide of Forster&rsquo;s right-hand post.<br><br>Thistle continued to press eagerly in search of an equaliser. A lack of composure led to Chris Erskine passing up a good opportunity in the 30th minute. Gary Fraser and Taylor combined neatly on the right to engineer space for Erskine on the edge of the penalty area. The on-loan Dundee United midfielder pushed the ball beyond Ambrose&rsquo;s challenge but his touch was just too heavy, denying him a clear shooting chance.<br><br>Izaguirre was extremely fortunate to escape a caution from referee Steven McLean a minute later when he cynically halted Erskine&rsquo;s run just outside the penalty area. Thistle were unable to make anything of the resulting free kick.<br><br>Celtic were offering far less than might be expected in response. They had a promising set-piece situation of their own when Commons was fouled by Gabriel Piccolo on the edge of the 18-yard box. Commons took it himself but sent the ball sailing way over the top of Gallacher&rsquo;s crossbar.<br><br>Lennon made a change at the start of the second half, introducing Henderson for Adam Matthews. It necessitated a reshuffle, Ambrose moving to right-back while Mulgrew dropped back into central defence. But it was Henderson&rsquo;s presence in midfield which quickly provided the fresh impetus Celtic required.<br><br>The teenager, in only his fourth first-team appearance, grabbed himself a slice of title-clinching history at the club when he made it 2-0 in the 49th minute to spark wild celebrations among the visiting support behind the goal Celtic were now attacking. Izaguirre&rsquo;s cross from the left was dummied by both Commons and Griffiths as the ball travelled across the face of the Thistle penalty area. It was collected by Henderson, who had made a well-timed run on the right, and he showed admirable composure to guide a low right-foot shot across Gallacher into the corner of the net. The party could now start in earnest as far as the Celtic fans were concerned and even the remotest prospect of a Thistle recovery was extinguished when the champions made it 3-0 four minutes later.<br><br>O&rsquo;Donnell misjudged his attempt to cut out a long forward pass from Mulgrew and his error was seized upon by Johansen. The Norwegian burst down the left, playing an exchange of passes with Griffiths before slamming a low, left-foot shot beyond the helpless Gallacher from around eight yards. Thistle offered what proved futile resistance when substitute Elliott beat Forster with a fine right-foot shot in the 85th minute. Celtic&rsquo;s response was very much in the manner of champions. Substitute Georgios Samaras provided two piercing passes in stoppage time, the first slammed home by Stokes, the second driven under Gallacher by Commons.<br><br>Venue: Firhill<br><br>Referee: S McLean<br><br>Attendance: 7,549  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br>By Clive Lindsay BBC Scotland Sport<br><br>Celtic secured their third Scottish title in a row with seven games to spare after a five-goal demolition of Partick Thistle at Firhill.<br><br>It is the earliest the Scottish top flight has been secured since Rangers won on 16 March in season 1928-29.<br><br>After Anthony Stokes headed in early, it was a party waiting to be unleashed.<br><br>Liam Henderson and Stefan Johansen added to that before Christie Elliot&#39;s reply and Stokes and Kris Commons ensured the champagne flowed.<br><br>The victory establishes an unassailable 26-point lead over second-placed Aberdeen as Celtic are crowned champions for the 45th time.<br><br>With the Dons having been held to a draw away to Ross County 24 hours earlier, the scene had been set for Neil Lennon&#39;s side to win the title in a Glasgow derby.<br>Liam Henderson and Stefan Johansen celebrate<br><br>Liam Henderson and Stefan Johansen both scored in the second half<br><br>Many Celtic fans might have taken greater pleasure in securing it at the home of a certain other club in Scotland&#39;s biggest city, but the absence of Rangers from the top flight has made their task easier for the second season running.<br><br>Thistle had gone into the game desperate for points at the other end of the table, where they sit two points ahead of second-bottom St Mirren in a five-team fight to avoid a relegation play-off.<br><br>The Maryhill outfit were seeking a third straight home win after a season-long wait for a home victory since their return to the top flight, and manager Alan Archibald had voiced his determination to avoid hosting a championship party.<br><br>However, Emilio Izaguirre sent over a cross from the left and the unmarked Stokes stepped out of the shadows at the back post to head past goalkeeper Paul Gallacher from eight yards.<br><br>Celtic had scored 11 goals in their previous three games and it looked like they were about to unleash another goals-fest as the ball pinged about a penalty box unconvincingly guarded by a nervous home defence.<br><br>Whether it was down to Celtic&#39;s complacency or premature feelings of celebration, Thistle did well to weather that early pressure and work their way gradually into the match.<br><br>They took control for a period in the first half and Johansen and Izaguirre were fortunate not to earn yellow cards as the champions-elect became increasingly edgy.<br><br>However, since losing to Barcelona in the Champions League, Celtic have played 17 domestic games and only lost goals in two of them - both in defeats by in-form Aberdeen. Thistle rarely looked like they had the ability to unlock the visitors.<br><br>Henderson had been left out of Celtic&#39;s starting line-up as Efe Ambrose returned to the defence, but the winger&#39;s introduction at half-time for full-back Adam Matthews breathed new life into Lennon&#39;s side.<br><br>Caught out early again, the Thistle back-line was made to look foolish as Izaguirre&#39;s cross was dummied first by Commons and then Stokes, allowing the unmarked 17-year-old to fire low into the far corner for his first Celtic goal.<br><br>It was two goals within four minutes as Johansen played a one-two with Leigh Griffiths before powering into the penalty box and firing his second goal in as many games.<br><br>Only then did Thistle become an attacking threat, Lyle Taylor just failing to make contact with an Aaron Taylor-Sinclair cross to the front post; Gary Fraser&#39;s powerful long-range drive being turned wide by Fraser Forster and then Taylor heading straight at the goalkeeper.<br><br>Commons was denied by a Gallacher save, while Stephen O&#39;Donnell forced Forster into more action at the other end.<br><br>Thistle had cries for a penalty waved away by referee Steven McLean when a shot from Prince Buaben shot struck the arm of Charlie Mulgrew, before Elliot fired past Forster.<br><br>By then, however, Celtic were already well on their way to ensuring they would become the first champions since the Scottish Premier League became the Scottish Premiership after its merger with the Scottish Football League.<br><br>A superb Stokes volley and Commons finish on the break in the dying seconds finished the job, keeping the title at Celtic Park<br><br>BBC<br>Celtic boss Neil Lennon hails &#39;breathtaking&#39; title-winners<br><br>Neil Lennon hailed his Celtic side&#39;s title-winning 5-1 defeat of Partick Thistle as a &quot;simply breathtaking&quot; way to emphasise their Scottish dominance.<br><br>Celtic secured their 45th Scottish title with seven games to spare.<br><br>&quot;It was a fantastic night for the club, a fantastic performance, a fantastic support,&quot; Lennon told BBC Scotland.<br><br>&quot;Now we are really stamping our authority on the game in Scotland and want to take it further.

This is unquestionably the best league campaign I&#39;ve had as a manager.<br><br>&quot;We are the title favourites every season, but we&#39;ve been emphatic this year.&quot;<br><br>It is the earliest the title has been secured since Rangers won on 16 March in season 1928-29.<br><br>Lennon was not only proud of having only lost once in 30 league games so far but also with his side&#39;s style of football, goals tally and clean-sheet record.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got a very demanding support and aim to please. Certainly from the turn of the year, we have played a style of football that augurs well for the future,&quot; he said.<br><br>Celtic were unable to have a planned lap of honour at Firhill Stadium after a pitch invasion by some Celtic fans.<br>Play media<br><br>Highlights - Partick Thistle 1-5 Celtic<br><br>Lennon was not too concerned, saying they would make up for it at home to Ross County on Saturday. That was echoed by captain Scott Brown.<br><br>&quot;We were going to do a lap of honour, but I think it&#39;s just the stewards that are left now,&quot; said the midfielder. &quot;We&#39;re still having fun.<br><br>&quot;We knew we had the players to do it. The first-half performance wasn&#39;t the best, but we came out guns blazing in the second half and Partick Thistle couldn&#39;t deal with us.&quot;<br><br>Scotland defender Charlie Mulgrew was disappointed not to be able to share his joy with the visiting support.<br><br>&quot;It was a great result and a great way to end the season, but it would be nice for some fans to be here,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes you get carried away in the moment and the fans are obviously happy. These things happen.&quot;<br><br><br>  BBC<br>Celtic: How Scottish Premiership champions have had to up game<br>By Tom English BBC Scotland<br>Comments (200)<br><br>Any anxiety Celtic might have felt at having their celebration punctured by a Jag from Partick Thistle eased early at Firhill.<br><br>Anthony Stokes scored in the opening minutes, no home defender in his air space. A gift on party night. A goal that sent Neil Lennon&#39;s team on their way to a rout and a third straight league title.<br><br>They didn&#39;t win it where they wanted, but they won it how they wanted.<br><br>Stokes, the seasoned campaigner, calmed the nerves with the first. Liam Henderson scored the second and brought the feel-good factor that comes with the rise of a young player nurtured in the Celtic Park nursery.<br><br>Stefan Johansen added the third and offered further evidence that his signing was an astute piece of business by Lennon.<br><br>Then Stokes again and finally Kris Commons, the goal machine who has done something that few at Celtic Park thought possible - a midfielder who has scored goals in a similar flow as their principal striker of last season, the departed Gary Hooper.<br><br>This was a typical experience for Celtic on the road to the championship. Overpowering and ruthless. Explosive at times.<br><br> &ldquo;What is undeniable is that Celtic have upped their game&rdquo;<br><br>In the league, Lennon&#39;s team have been strong and reliable and, on occasion, excellent. You can point out the myriad traumas in their Champions League campaign, you can flag up the embarrassment of their League Cup exit to Morton and remind them of the hurt inflicted on them by Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup.<br><br>But in the Premiership, they have ruled.<br><br>Just one loss. More points already than they had in all of last season. The player of the year in Commons. The signing of the season in Virgil van Dijk. Fraser Forster&#39;s record-busting resistance in goal.<br><br>This Celtic campaign has been better than the last one, which is an achievement given that the last one featured more than &pound;20m worth of talent that has subsequently been sold.<br><br>And it&#39;s almost certainly going to prove better than the one that began this treble, achieved in the year of Rangers&#39; meltdown.<br><br>Lennon&#39;s first championship was achieved with a points total of 93. With seven games left, Celtic are now sitting on 84 points. The century is not beyond them.<br><br>What is undeniable is that Celtic have upped their game. So, too, have the teams around them.<br><br>Aberdeen, Motherwell and Dundee United have made big, if not, gargantuan strides. Aberdeen and United have already out-done their points totals from last season and Motherwell are odds-on favourites to do the same pretty quickly.<br><br>The progression on the field is obvious, but the statistical manifestation of it is interesting. Aberdeen have won 63% of their games in all competitions this season. That&#39;s up from 30% last season. You have to go back 21 years before the Dons won with such regularity.<br><br>United have won 53% of the time - up from 33%. It&#39;s been 27 years since the Tannadice side won with such consistency.<br>Kris Commons<br><br>Kris Commons completed the scoring in Celtic&#39;s 5-1 victory at Firhill<br><br>Motherwell, the same. Stuart McCall, one of Scotland&#39;s most impressive club managers, has moved things forward despite having had to rebuild his team in the summer. The Steelmen have won 54% of their games - a 14% rise. In 29 years the Fir Park side have not won as often as they have in this current season.<br><br>Of course these numbers will change. And there are nuances to all of this. There wasn&#39;t such a gulf between sides in Scotland a quarter of a century ago. The quality was distributed more evenly. Games were harder to win. Achieving consistency was more difficult when the country had multiple sides capable of big things.<br><br>The point is this, though: these clubs are winning more than they have done in many years and yet Celtic have still destroyed them in the league table.<br><br>Lennon&#39;s side are a seismic 26 points ahead of their nearest rival and have had to play some very good football to pull it off.<br><br>There are those who will argue until the cows come home - or, more the point, when Rangers come back - that Celtic&#39;s title is devalued because they haven&#39;t had to beat much. The truth is that they have beaten improving teams and they have beaten them more impressively than they have before.<br><br>The elephant in the room - or the Teddy Bear - is Rangers. The ecstatic Celtic supporters at Firhill - including those who invaded the pitch - would have little truck with the notion that their title means less because they haven&#39;t had to beat Rangers to seal it.<br>Play media<br><br>Highlights - Partick Thistle 1-5 Celtic<br><br>That&#39;s what they say in public at any rate. Defiance to a man and woman.<br><br>In private, you wonder. How could it mean the same? Would it mean the same to Barcelona if they won La Liga without Real Madrid in their slipstream? In any championship in the world where a historic rivalry exists between two behemoths, it has to matter if one of them is missing from battle.<br><br>The moment of victory has to feel different, the sense of fulfilment not what it might have been had you trampled your greatest rival underfoot.<br><br>Rangers will return, but for all the hubris we have heard from Dave King, the would-be redeemer of Ibrox, Celtic should be in an even stronger position then than they are now by the time the League One champions reappear in the top tier.<br><br>They&#39;ll certainly have another title. They may have extra Champions League millions and whatever riches they get in due course for their marketable assets like Forster and Van Dijk. They are so far ahead of Rangers at the moment that they can&#39;t even see them in the rear-view mirror.<br><br>This was a rousing victory that sealed a strong campaign. Celtic forever pine for foreign shores, for the English Premier League or some kind of European league. A modest little ground in a small corner of Glasgow was good enough, though. Paradise of sorts.  <br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Partick Thistle 1, Celtic 5.<br>90:00 +3:48 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Partick Thistle 1, Celtic 5.<br>90:00 +2:54 Goal scored<br><br>Goal!
