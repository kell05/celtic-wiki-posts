Five minutes later another intimation was raised from a alarm in  Great Eastern Road, sent by a man named Anderson, residing in Yate  Street, Camlachie. <br><br>The Central and Eastern Divisions, under firemaster  Paterson, were turned out, and on their arrival in the narrow roadway  between the football ground and Janefield Cemetery the firemen found   that the stand itself was a mass of flames, and the was no or little  hope of saving the pavilion. The fire had originated near the east-end  of the stand, and fanned by a slight easterly wind the flames were blown  westward with terrible rapidity. In a incredible short time they worked  their way through the open woodwork with a loud and ominous crackling  which could be heard at a considerable distance. <br><br>The wind carried the  sparks in the directions of the &quot;Grant&quot; Stand and at one time there was  serious danger of it becoming ignited. Fortunately the breeze was not of  sufficient strength to carry the embers such a distance, but the  scorched and blackened grass bore testimony to the danger which this  operation was placed. At this juncture the fire presented a magnificent  spectacle.<br><br>When at its height the fire shed a brilliant  reflection on the sky, which was seen for miles around. As far as  Coatbridge, the semi-circular glow showed clear above the horizon. From  the other side of the park the spectacle was a fine one, the whole  erection with the woodwork of the terracing and the roof all ablaze, the  iron struts and girders standing out against the bright background, and  parts of the corrugated iron roof falling in large sheets into the  burning basement of the structure and throwing up great showers of  sparks and flames. <br><br>About half an hour after the brigade arrived the  large flagstaff which stood above at the centre of the stand fell  outwards into the street, carrying with it a portion of the structure.  The fire at this time had spread to the west end of the grand stand, and  soon the pavilion also was in flames, This building being, like the  stand, principally of wood and light inflammable material, burned  rapidly and although some of the rooms in the ground flat were not  destroyed by fire, the structure was completely wrecked.<br><font size="4"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font><h3>Description of Stand </h3>The  grand stand, which was on the north-east side of the field, was about  110 yards in length and 30 yards in breadth. It was constructed after  the usual pattern of such erections, with terraced seats rising  backwards from the cycling track to the outside of the ground to a  height altogether of about 50 feet. It provided sitting accommodation of  about 3500 spectators, and had a corrugated iron roof supported on  steel struts and girders. The pavilion which stood a little to the  North-west of the stand, was a comparatively small building. being only  40 feet by 30 feet and two storeys in height. <br><br>It included the rooms of  the club, a billiard room, in which was a table which cost &pound;75, retiring  rooms for the players, bathrooms, and other apartments. In the pavilion  was a large quantity of what in football parlance is described as  &quot;stock&quot;, consisting of players clothing, hurdles and other athletic  apparatus, and seats for the track, to the value of about &pound;500. when  erected 10 years ago the stand and pavilion cost about &pound;6000. The  erections, however, have from time to time been strengthened and  improved to meet the requirements of the Dean of Guild court.<br><br>So  recently as the International match. which was played on the 9th of last  month. The stand was completely renovated, and having been officially  inspected by the Master of Works the liners of the Courts declared it to  be safe and sound in every respect<br><b><font size="4"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font></b><h3>The Damage</h3>The  erections destroyed were insured to the extent of only about &pound;2000; and  there was no insurance on the contents of the pavilion. The loss to the  club will therefore amount to fully &pound;4000. The stand which has been  destroyed, it should be understood. is the grand or north, stand and not  the &quot;Grant&quot; stand which is on the opposite side of the field.<br><br>We  are informed that, notwithstanding, the structure of the stand, the  match between the Hibernians and Celtic will be played tonight according  to arrangement.<br><br><a class="external" href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/545/1904k.jpg/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Posted Image" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/f6cB92Lv0zn2410ipoIQmQ91258" title="Posted Image"></a><br><font size="4"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font><h3>Evening Telegraph, 10th May 1904<a class="external" href="http://kjellhanssen.com/2012/12/05/celtic-park-on-fire/celtic-park/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img align="right" alt="Celtic Park" height="246" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/MKuCRwV5_0MRiA77uKgqsg11532/GW205H246" title="Celtic Park" width="205"></a></h3><font size="4"><br></font></div><b>Great fire at Celtic Park<br>Grand Stand and Pavilion Gutted<br>&pound;6,000 damage; only partly insured<br>Club likely to lose &pound;4,000</b><br><br>The  grand stand and pavilion at the grounds of the Celtic Football Club,  Glasgow, were completely destroyed by fire last night. The central and  Eastern Divisions, under Firemaster Paterson, were turned out, and on  their arrival in the narrow roadway between the football ground and  Janefield Cemetery the firemen found that the stand itself was a mass of  flames, and that there was little or no hope of saving the pavilion.  The fire had originated near the east end of the stand, and, fanned by a  slight westerly wind, the flames were blown westward with terrible  rapidity. In an incredible short time they worked their way through the  open woodwork with a loud and ominous crackling which could be heard at a  considerable distance. The wind carried the sparks in the direction of  the &ldquo;Grant&rdquo; Stand, and at one time there was serious danger of it also  becoming ignited. Fortunately the breeze was not of sufficient strength  to carry the embers such a distance, but the scorched and blackened  grass bore testimony to the danger in which this erection was placed. At  one juncture the fire presented a brilliant spectacle.<br><br>Before the  police arrangements had been thoroughly perfected the crowd in Janefield  Street was very dense, and numbers had climbed upon the wall of the  cemetery. When at its height the fire shed a brilliant reflection on the  sky, which was seen for miles around. As far away as Coatbridge the  semi-circular glow showed clear above the horizon. From the other side  of the park the spectacle was a fine one, the whole erection with the  woodwork of the terracing and the roof all ablaze, the iron struts and  girders standing out against the bright background, parts of the  corrugated iron roof falling in large sheets into the burning basement  of the structure and throwing up great showers of sparks and flames.  About half an hour after the brigade arrived the large flagstaff which  stood above at the centre of the stand fell outwards into the street,  carrying with it a portion of the structure. The fire at this time had  spread to the west end of the grand stand, and soon the pavilion also  was in flames. This building, being like the stand principally  constructed of wood and of light and inflammable material, burned  rapidly. The upper storey was completely destroyed, and although one or  two of the rooms in the ground flat were not burned out, the building  was totally wrecked. By midnight the flames had pretty <span class="diffRemove">wellspent</span><span class="diffAdd">well-spent</span>  themselves. All the corrugated iron of the roof had fallen in great  twisted masses among the burned and ruined terracing, and the beams and  girders lay bent among the other debris, the whole presenting a  picturesque sight.<br><br>The grand stand, which was on the north side of  the field, was about 110 yards in length and 30 yards breadth. It was  constructed after the usual pattern of such <span class="diffRemove">errections,</span><span class="diffAdd">erections,</span> with terraced  seats rising backwards from the cycling track to the outside of the  grounds to a height altoghether of about 50 feet.

The loss to the Club will therefore amount to fully &pound;4,000.  The stand which has been destroyed, it should be understood, is the  grand, or north, stand &ndash; not the &ldquo;Grant&rdquo; stand, which is on the opposite  side of the field. Notwithstanding the destruction of the stand, the  match between the Hibernians and the Celtic will be played to-night  according to arrangement.<br><br><br></div>
