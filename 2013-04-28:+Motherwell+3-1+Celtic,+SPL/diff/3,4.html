staff<br>April 28, 2013<br>Henrik Ojamaa was on the scoresheet for Motherwell &copy; PA Photos<br>Enlarge<br><br>Motherwell clinched a Europa League spot in impressive style by coming from behind to beat Celtic 3-1 in an entertaining Scottish Premier League clash at Fir Park.<br><br>Gary Hooper opened the scoring for the visitors in the 39th minute before Henrik Ojamaa levelled seconds before the interval.<br><br>Motherwell&#39;s top scorer Michael Higdon put the home side ahead from the spot five minutes into the second-half after Celtic defender Charlie Mulgrew was adjudged to have fouled Ojamaa just inside the box.<br><br>Five minutes later right-back Mikael Lustig headed a Tom Hateley cross against his own post with the luckless Hoops goalkeeper Fraser Forster seeing the ball come off him and into his own net.<br><br>Motherwell moved on to 60 points, nine ahead of third-place Inverness with three games remaining, and it would take a remarkable collapse to deprive the Steelmen of second spot but Europe is guaranteed.<br><br>There should be no surprise that Celtic looked ropey at times.<br><br>Having clinched the SPL title last week against Inverness, and with one eye on the early return in the summer for Champions League qualifiers, Hoops boss Neil Lennon allowed Kris Commons, Joe Ledley, Efe Ambrose and Kelvin Wilson to go on holiday.<br><br>Among the six changes to the visitors&#39; side there were rare starts for defender Thomas Rogne, midfielder Tom Rogic and striker Tony Watt.<br><br>The game was delayed five minutes for running repairs to an advertising sign on the roof of one of the stands and then the home side applauded Celtic on to the park in tribute to their title win.<br><br>Watched by Lennon sitting in the stands serving the second of a three-match touchline ban, Watt flashed a drive over the bar from the edge of the box in the first minute.<br><br>Celtic had a decent chance in the 17th minute when stand-in skipper Georgios Samaras set up Beram Kayal at the edge of the box but the Israel midfielder&#39;s strike, powerful as it was, went straight to Well keeper Darren Randolph.<br><br>A trademark Mulgrew free-kick from 30 yards on the half-hour mark had Randolph throwing himself to his left to parry clear but three minutes later he made an even better save from Hooper, who had escaped Stevie Hammell at the back post to latch on to Rogic&#39;s cross.<br><br>It looked like the former Scunthorpe striker would have the easiest of tasks knocking in from three yards but Randolph brilliantly blocked the volley and the Steelmen breathed again.<br><br>There was a claim for a penalty at the other end seconds later when then ball looked to have come off Rogne&#39;s arm from a Keith Lasley flick but referee Euan Norris was having none of it.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s opener came when Watt sped past Simon Ramsden down the left and took advantage of Randolph coming too far off his line to knock the ball over to the unmarked Hooper.<br><br>The striker&#39;s header came off the crossbar before he gathered the rebound and knocked it over the line.<br><br>Motherwell looked rattled but were level when Lasley played in Ojamaa who went past Mulgrew with ease and before Lustig could intervene, he drove low past Forster and in at the near post.<br><br>It was an encouraging end to the first-half for Stuart McCall&#39;s men and there was only five minutes gone in the second-half when Mulgrew clashed with Ojamaa in the Celtic box and the referee pointed to the spot.<br><br>Higdon confidently slammed the penalty high past Forster for his 25th SPL goal of the season and the keeper&#39;s misery was compounded five minutes later when Lustig inadvertently put a searching cross from Hateley against his own post with the ball rebounding off the stopper and into the net.<br><br>The game stretched rather dramatically thereafter.<br><br>The home defence looked as fragile as Celtic&#39;s but in the 63rd minute Forster had to stretch to make a good save when Chris Humphrey&#39;s shot deflected off Mulgrew and looked like looping over him, with the Hoops defender completing the clearance.<br><br>The Fir Park side had a great chance to increase their lead in the 69th minute when Ojamaa sent James McFadden racing clear with a pass that cut open the Hoops defence but, with Humphrey looking for the cut-back, he drove straight at Forster, who made another decent save from Higdon&#39;s low drive from the edge of the box moments later.<br><br>The game petered out in rather ramshackle style with Celtic squandering a series of half-chances and substitute Anthony Stokes, on for Samaras, hitting the post but the home side deserved the cheers they got from their fans at the final whistle.<span class="diffRemove">

football for the 2013/14 season by coming from behind to beat Celtic at Fir Park.<br><br>Gary Hooper put the visitors in front at the second attempt after initially heading against the crossbar.<br><br>Henrik Ojamaa levelled for Motherwell following good work from Keith Lasley.<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew&#39;s clip on Ojamaa allowed Michael Higdon to score from the penalty spot, then Mikael Lustig&#39;s misplaced header came off post and Fraser Forster for Motherwell&#39;s third.<br><br>This energetic and attacking performance from Motherwell secures their place in a Europa League qualifying round - the fifth time in six years they will play on the European stage.<br>Play media<br><br>Stuart McCall&#39;s men are also one point away from confirming a second-place finish in the Scottish Premier League.<br><br>Neil Lennon&#39;s Celtic are already SPL champions but have now lost on both of their visits to Fir Park in 2013.<br><br>Almost immediately after the slightly delayed kick-off caused by a loose advertising board on the roof of a stand, Celtic&#39;s Tony Watt hit a dipping half-volley narrowly over Darren Randolph&#39;s crossbar following Tom Rogic&#39;s flighted pass.<br><br>And Motherwell showed early attacking intentions, too, when Nicky Law&#39;s whipped cross almost found Shaun Hutchinson in the six-yard box.<br><br>Rogic and Celtic captain Georgios Samaras combined at the edge of the box to create a shooting opportunity for Beram Kayal, but the midfielder&#39;s effort was held at head height by Randolph.<br><br>Referee Euan Norris overruled his assistant&#39;s offside flag to allow Kayal another blocked shot inside the box as the visitors continued to press.<br>Gary Hooper&#39;s 29th goal of the season gave Celtic the lead at Fir Park<br><br>Gary Hooper&#39;s 29th goal of the season gave Celtic the lead at Fir Park<br><br>As he so often does, James McFadden took it upon himself to excite the Fir Park crowd just short of the half-hour, jinking between Kayal and Lustig on the left-hand side before sending a right-foot strike high and wide of the far post.<br><br>Celtic reacted through a swift attack engineered by the impressive Rogic, who fed Samaras to deliver low for Hooper in front of goal, but the attentions of Motherwell full-back Stevie Hammell scuppered his finish.<br><br>&#39;Well goalkeeper Randolph then offered any potential suitors something of a sales pitch.<br><br>The Irishman dived left to keep out Mulgrew&#39;s free-kick before making himself big to brilliantly deny Hooper from close range at the back post after Watt&#39;s precise cross.<br><br>At the other end, Thomas Rogne&#39;s handball did not bring a penalty for Motherwell, which was made all the more hard to swallow given that the Hoops broke the deadlock a minute later.<br><br>The lively Watt eluded Simon Ramsden on the left and poked a cross over the onrushing Randolph for Hooper to first head against the bar before he netted the rebound.<br>Play media<br><br>But Motherwell hit back on the stroke of half-time.<br><br>Captain Lasley used his experience to collect and distribute the ball in two touches, setting up Ojamaa to fire in low at Forster&#39;s near post from 18 yards.<br><br>And the Estonian forward won an innocuous penalty when clipped by Mulgrew after the restart.<br><br>Player of the season nominee Higdon stepped up to convincingly convert into the top-right corner for his 26th goal of the campaign.<br><br>Higdon, albeit seeming to be in an offside position from Tom Hateley&#39;s cross, made his presence felt again immediately as Motherwell got their third.<br><br>The Liverpudlian forced Lustig to head against his own post, with it rebounding off the back of Forster and into the net.<br><br>Watt&#39;s blocked shot almost got Celtic back into the game before Forster kept them in it, reacting brilliantly to claw away a Chris Humphrey drive which had deflected off Mulgrew.<br><br>Celtic introduced Paddy McCourt but Motherwell&#39;s chances flowed freely; McFadden thwarted by Forster when he looked odds on to score before Celtic&#39;s keeper stopped Higdon&#39;s low shot.<br><br>Substitute Anthony Stokes hit the post for the visitors late on but Motherwell deserved their victory.<br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>90:00 +3:13 Full time<br><br>Full Time The
