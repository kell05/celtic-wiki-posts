In an historic perspective, it can be rather more generous to him than to his younger relatives Michael and Kevin Kelly.<br><br>By modern standards, he was an autocrat, no question of that, but his role was hardly extraordinary for his era. What he didn&#39;t do, though, was recognise the changing trends around him in the game (e.g. the track suited <a href="/page/managers" target="_self">managers</a>, the development of European football) until it was almost too late. He appointed <a href="/page/Stein%2C+Jock" target="_self">Jock Stein</a>, initially with reluctance, just in time for the club, but at least he did that and established a good working relationship with the Big Man up until his death. Stein appears to have respected Kelly considerably. <br><br>Ultimately the debit side may outweigh to the credit side when analysing Kelly, but even so, he had noble qualities that deserve to be remembered. His Corinthian approach was genuine and players were often dropped for on-field misdemeanours when the club was not compelled to do so by the disciplinary rules of the day. Even Stein was known to drop a player out of deference to Kelly. <br><br>On balance, historians will have to see Kelly as a hopeless idealist, not really equipped to lead Celtic in a modern (or possibly any) age. However, people cannot deny that his philosophy was not that far from that of sections of the supporters either and in that respect, we cannot deny him his label as a true Celt. However, the old board eulogised him in a way that was right out of proportion to his achievements and nothing illustrated their nepotism and cronyism more than this. For that, perhaps the supporters now would condemn Kelly rather vehemently than they ought to.<br><br>Bob Kelly used to swat away criticism easily and forced his critics during the barren years in the early 1960&#39;s voicing that they should wait until the upcoming juniors were to come into the senior side. These &quot;<a href="/page/Kelly%27s+Kids" target="_self">Kelly&#39;s Kids</a>&quot; were to be the hallmark of Celtic&#39;s success under Jock Stein. Additionally, Bob Kelly alone can&#39;t be held responsible for all the failings of the players at the time in the barren years of the late 1950s/early 1960s. Legendary coach Jimmy Hogan was brought into the club to assist, yet at Celtic the players treated him poorly and various players (like the fans favourite Charlie Tully) treated training with disdain. Passing the buck onto the Chairman alone can be viewed as misleading or simply too convenient for some.<br><br>And yes, his stand during the <a href="/page/Eire+flag+-+The+Irish+flag+controversy+%281952%29" target="_self">Irish flag affair</a> in <a href="/page/1952" target="_self">1952</a> was probably his finest moment, where he stood up proudly to the bigots and simpletons who were trying to equate the hoisting of the Irish flag to being a sectarian icon. Complete nonsense of a situation in reflection, however it was a serious issue in the environment at the time and it took a strong and brave stance from Bob Kelly to take on the establishment.<br><br>On a bigger scale, Bob Kelly must be applauded for his stance in the European Cup 1968/69 where due to the Soviet invasion in Czechoslovakia he made a stand against playing against Eastern European sides after Celtic had been paired with the Hungarian club Ferencvaros at the height of the Cold War. Bob Kelly led the protests that led to others following his brave stance and threatening a boycott.<br><br>Chairman          Bob Kelly insisted Celtic could not possibly travel to Eastern Europe          in such sensitive political times. As          a result the European Cup had to be re-drawn keeping clubs from Eastern and Western Europe apart. Celtic got St-Etienne          instead. In return, FC Levski (Sofia), Ferencvarosi, Dinamo Kiev and Ruch Chorzow withdrew; clubs from Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia remained in the competition.<br><br>Notably, it is said Bob Kelly&#39;s own hopes of getting a knighthood were boosted by the fact he threatened to withdraw Celtic from the European Cup because they were drawn against Ferencvaros of Hungary. He was deserving of the title for this stance and it&#39;s something we should respect in this instance. <br><br><div>As Jock Stein was to state following Robert Kelly&#39;s passing: </div><blockquote><div><i> &quot;No man has done more for the club [Celtic] in every way than Sir Robert Kelly&quot;.</i></div></blockquote><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Opinion 2   </h3><img align="right" alt="Robert Kelly - Kerrydale Street" height="515" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/6AqMTU29kJtoNJkhHw-Vgw59070/GW330H515" title="Robert Kelly - Kerrydale Street" width="330">Kelly&#39;s interference with team selection was so erratic and inexplicable that it possibly cost Celtic three Cup Final defeats - <a href="/page/1955" target="_self">1955</a> (<a href="/page/Clyde" target="_self">Clyde</a>), <a href="/page/1956" target="_self">1956</a> (<a href="/page/Hearts" target="_self">Hearts</a>) and <a href="/page/1961" target="_self">1961</a> (Dunfermline). Celtic could have won at least 2 of these (<a href="/page/Hearts" target="_self">Hearts</a> were probably superior in 1956) but for his meddling in the team selections, and this was reflected in many other results as well.<br><br>One of the stranger selections was that of picking <a href="/page/Goldie%2C+William" target="_self">William Goldie</a>. Willie had not originally been selected for the side but was spotted by his team mates walking to the ground as a spectator with his Celtic scarf wrapped around his neck. He was picked up by the team coach and so impressed was Chairman Robert Kelly with Willie&rsquo;s keen following of the team that he decided to play him. Willie Goldie was said to be at fault for the goals (he was the goalie) and never played for Celtic again!<br><br>Also, despite having players of the calibre of <a href="/page/Miller%2C+Willie" target="_self">Willie Miller</a>, Evans, Peacock, Collins, Fernie, Mochan, the two McPhails, Tully, Dunky McKay, Crerand etc. Celtic won only one league Championship between 1939 - 1965 (inclusive). He was quite content to preside over such mediocrity.  Truth is that he and the board were seeing Celtic as a birthright, and the standing of Celtic was more important than anything else. That is admirable but the standing of Celtic as a club and icon for the Scottish and Irish communities has only any credibility in achievement and not by wallowing in mediocrity by  living off of past glories.<br><br>Interference and incompetence was a major reason why Paddy Crerand left for Man Utd. Notably, Celtic could have had Matt Busby as the first team&#39;s manager at one point but Bob Kelly&#39;s board squandered that.  Things could have been so much easier for all.<br><br>When Bobby Evans left he scathed about the board stating: <br><blockquote>&quot;<i>He [i.e. the Celtic Captain] has no decisions to take about team changes or tactical changes. The answers to these problems come from the directors&#39; box [i.e. chairman Bob Kelly] to the track - and are passed to the field by the trainer.</i>&quot;<br></blockquote><br>One other example of meddling by the board/coaches was as per the following example (as re-told by journalist Archie MacPherson):<br><br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;John  McPhail told me that he was playing badly and expected to be dropped.  Jimmy McGrory and the directors had a meeting outside the dressing room  after which McGrory read out the team, including John McPhail, but [then  chairman] Bob Kelly was not with the other directors when the team was  announced.</i><br><br><i> &ldquo;After the game, Bob Kelly asked John McPhail  why he was playing. McPhail said, &ldquo;I was picked&rdquo;, to which Bob Kelly  replied, &ldquo;You were not supposed to be&rdquo;.</i><br><br><i> &ldquo;It turned out the Bob Kelly had diarrhoea and was unable to get instructions through on who he wanted to play.&quot;</i><br></blockquote> <br>In other spheres he was not very progressive, including not being supportive of the European competitions or the World Cup, and being very antagonistic towards TV involvement in football. It showed a lack of foresight.<br><br>When Jock Stein was appointed, one of his first tasks was to ensure that Bob Kelly was made clear that only one man was in charge of the first team and that was Jock himself. Otherwise, he&#39;d likely have left.  Not an easy task. Even after being made clear of who was in charge, he still liked to go to the changing rooms before kick-off to give a pious little speech. After one such talk, Jock Stein closed the door on him turned to the team and said &quot;<i>Right, you can forget all that for a start!</i>&quot;.  It was for Jock more a case of ensuring they knew whose word was most important.<br><br>He may have brought the club Jock Stein, but sadly the &quot;revolution&quot; didn&#39;t continue into the boardroom. The management squandered the opportunities from the team&#39;s success financially with little to show from it at the end of it all, and player unrest grew.  His successors were little better and showed that Bob Kelly was still an old school man at heart with no restructuring done to the board management into an increasingly commercial sporting world.<br><br>The worst part was that as a conservative member of the board, it entrenched a system that in time was to lead to the disastrous &#39;Celtic Takeover&#39; period where the club came close to administration if not outright collapse.

The conventional view of Kelly  is that he was an ambiguous character who was for some autocratic,  meddling and ignorant and yet for others, a visionary, a man of  principle and above all the man who was central to Celtic&rsquo;s great period  of success.<br><br>Let&rsquo;s start with the basic facts concerning Robert  Kelly. He was appointed as a director of the club in 1931, and became  chairman in 1947. He stepped down as chairman in 1971. One can  immediately see that in terms of service to the club, his contribution  was immense. He gave forty years of unstinted effort which saw the club  experience the good, the bad and the sublime.<br><br>For me the key date  was 1947 as it marks his ascension to power, with power being the  operative word. One has to try and get a sense of how football clubs  were run in those days to understand Bob Kelly.<br><br>Celtic like most  British clubs of that epoch, was essentially run by local businessmen  and quite often by small family dynasties. Clubs were passed down from  father to son, very much like a family heirloom. Parochialism was the  name of the game. Football was Scottish and then British, foreigners  simply didn&rsquo;t count. There was very much an emphasis on being &lsquo;safe&rsquo;,  and not taking big risks and keeping costs as low as possible. Given the  depressed economical situation of that era, it made perfect sense. Then  it was very apt to describe football as being the working man&rsquo;s game.<br><br>Two  seminal figures enter the Celtic world in the early fifties under  Kelly&rsquo;s watch. One was a certain Jock Stein who as a journeyman defender  signed from Llanelli Town in 1951. The other intriguing figure was that  of Jimmy Hogan, who deserves a book on his own.    Hogan was born in Lancashire in 1882, six years before Celtic came into  being.Born into an Irish family with eleven siblings, the diminutive  figure became a giant on the European continent. Hogan dismissed what he  saw as the &lsquo;kick and rush&rsquo; style of English football which placed great  emphasis on power and strength, rather than technique. He emphasized  skill and technique over brute strength. He like Brian Clough many years  later was a voice in the wilderness.  Being ignored in England he took himself off to continental Europe  and there made his name. He coached the legendary Hungarian team which  dismantled the England team at Wembley in 1953 by six goals to three. It  wasn&rsquo;t just the score line that stood out, but the manner of England&rsquo;s  defeat. They were comprehensively outclassed on the field, and the whole  notion of tactical awareness was a novel concept to the land that gave  the world football. Jimmy Hogan was central to this, and Ferenc Puskas  the magic Magyar, testified to this when playing for Real Madrid. Helmut  Schoen who managed the world cup winners of West Germany in 1974, also  cited Jimmy Hogan as being a major influence.<br><br>When Kelly invited  Hogan to coach at Celtic in the fifties he was already a very old man,  but possessed by an almost missionary zeal he set about converting  Celtic&rsquo;s players to his cause. The likes of Charlie Tully who refused to  be coached by anybody and dismissed the old man as a crank. Tully great  player as he was, did not respond to being told what to do. However  others did listen and learned, in particular the young Jock Stein who  understood intuitively the message Hogan was trying to impart. Great  emphasis was placed on ball control, retaining possession, tactical  deployment and above all physical fitness.<br><br>These ideas seem quite  normal by today&rsquo;s standards, but way back in the early fifties they  were revolutionary. Hogan&rsquo;s ideas and methods were inculcated to Stein  whose natural intelligence allowed him immediately to recognize their  worth.<br><br>Kelly&rsquo;s greatest decision was to appoint Jock Stein as  Celtic manager which in itself was a bold move. The revered but  ineffectual Jimmy McGrory was replaced by a man who had proved himself  first at Dunfermilne and then Hibernian.<br><br>What sort of players did  Stein inherit? It has to be said that the basis of the Lisbon Lions  team was already there, but they were disorganized, demotivated and in a  general state of disarray. Pat Crerand had been allowed to leave for  Manchester United, but the vastly superior Bobby Murdoch replaced him  after Stein made the inspirational decision to switch him from inside  right to right half. In short, the players were already there under  Kelly&rsquo;s watch. He had the contemporary idea of finding, developing and  retaining local talent. Willie Wallace and the veteran Ronnie Simpson  would be added, but the nucleus was in place due to Kelly&rsquo;s philosophy.  The rest was up to the genius that was Jock Stein, Kelly despite the  stereotype did not interfere in team selections. Kelly and Stein had a  very amicable relationship based on mutual respect.<br><br>Kelly was  very much a proud Catholic and equally proud of his Irish forbears. We  can still see the black and white photos of him with numerous members of  the Catholic clergy. He was determined that Celtic should never bow to  the forces of ignorance and sectarianism that governed (and continue to  govern) Scottish football. The current spat with Peat and co, were as  nothing to what Kelly faced in the fifties and sixties. Glasgow and  Scotland was much more polarized than it is today. Having an Irish  sounding name or coming from a Catholic school meant automatic exclusion  from the workplace. Rangers operated an open sectarian policy of  recruitment, aided and abetted by those who ran the game. Many Catholics  felt totally excluded from mainstream Scottish society. Outwith their  faith and their families, Celtic football club remained the sole  institution that championed the cause of the underdog Catholic  population. The great flag dispute when Celtic were ordered to take down  the Irish tricolour from the main stand due to its &lsquo;provocative&rsquo;  nature, was one of Kelly&rsquo;s finest moments. He refused to be bullied by  the bigots and the tricolour continues to flutter above Paradise.<br><br>Kelly  remains a perplexing figure, on the one hand despotic and intransigent  and yet on the other hand perceptive and receptive to new ideas. It was  Kelly who sent the young Jock Stein to &lsquo;observe&rsquo; the World Cup finals in  Switzerland in 1954. There he saw Hogan&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;s the mighty Magyars  narrowly lose to West Germany in the final. When one reads of the input  of Stein and to a lesser extent of Hogan, we see the genesis of the  &ldquo;Celtic way&rsquo; of playing football. The Stein/Kelly era was the definitive  period when the Celtic way emerged. It didn&rsquo;t happen by chance, it was  created by Jock Stein and nurtured by Bob Kelly.<br><br>It was also  Kelly who mooted the idea about Celtic joining the English league as far  back as the late sixties. He also foresaw the coming importance of  television revenue for football and its consequences. Kelly&rsquo;s visionary  outlook is perhaps an example for those running the show at Celtic Park  in 2010.</td> </tr>  </tbody></table>    			 			 			<br><img align="bottom" alt="Brother Walfrid Remembrance (2012) - Pic" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/VtwOnYOxBBFifAxE1jUJlw229176" title="Brother Walfrid Remembrance (2012) - Pic"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Brother Walfrid Remembrance (2012) - Pic" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/BbHmCAguvHvhsn842RPQvg189884" title="Brother Walfrid Remembrance (2012) - Pic"><br><br><h3>Bob Kelly in Lisbon</h3><img align="bottom" alt="[Untitled]" height="612" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/TW0fMF4Yfs9ThN2xCGmOpA370825/GW944H612" title="[Untitled]" width="944"><br></div></div>
