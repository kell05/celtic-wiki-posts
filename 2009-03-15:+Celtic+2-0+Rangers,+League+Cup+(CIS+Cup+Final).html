Also WGS&#39; first also come to think of it.<br><br>With Celtic out of the Scottish Cup and the League as close as can get (3pts ahead only of the Huns), this is supposedly meant to have been our effort to ensure the Huns can&#39;t do a Treble!  For them, a chance to get a psychological boost in their efforts to stop us winning the league.  In all honestly it&#39;s window dressing, and the league is far separate for all.  Regardless, any match against the Huns must be won and this is for a trophy.<br><br>Almost full-strength squads for both with no excuses, a bright sunny day (first this year) and we&#39;re all off to Hampden on the Sunday before &quot;St Patrick&#39;s Day&quot;. First surprise of the day is that WGS has bamboozled us again with team selection including the unpopular inclusion of Loovens in defence and moving Caldwell to midfield.  Nice one!  Baffled Celtic fans as miffed with the manager as they have been through much of the last quarter of the season so far.<br><br>Before the game, credit to the Hampden staff for putting up a good display at the final. Was wonderful to watch.<br><br>Anyhow, match itself is covered more fully in the match reports below, and low and behold we are winners again! Our first victory over the Huns in a cup final in twenty years!  Great stuff. Looked as if this would go all the way to penalties at the end of the 90mins, both sides impotent in front of goals, but Naka swung round a great corner kick for O&#39;Dea to get his head at the end and become an unlikely match winner. His first goal for two years and a cracking way to celebrate St Patrick&#39;s Day (sort of).<br><br>In truth, we should have had this wrapped up in the 90mins, albeit Rangers did have their chances, and again we are making things hard for ourselves. The 4-5-1 was changed to 4-4-2 with Samaras on after we squandered much of our advantages during the game. Biggest surprise was the form of Glenn Loovens! Written off by 99% before the start of this game, he was excellent and was unfortunate not to get a goal which was cleared off the line by Rangers. <br><br>Hinkel was another deserving credit, although in the first half Kyle Lafferty had the measure of him but things were different in the second half. McGeady, Naka &amp; Brown played some great football with some nice touches. A joy to watch. Tireless running saw McGeady finally bagging the goal he deserved, albeit from the penalty spot after Kirk Broadfoot brought him down in the final minute of extra-time.<br><br>However, shooting was appalling and for all our good work we had few shots on goal. Samaras was woeful and squandered some gilt edged chances. The league is most important, and performances in front of goal like this are going to lose us the league.<br><br>At the end of it all, we stopped the Huns treble chances, we picked up our morale and way outsung the curiously quiet Huns!

Attendance 51,193</div>  <div class="TailParas">Celtic won this brutal, sometimes engrossing slog of a Co-operative Insurance Cup final at Hampden Park yesterday, and it was one of those unarguable occasions when the better team won. Gordon Strachan&#39;s side were far more creative and dangerous than a cautious Rangers, to the point where it would have been galling for the Celtic legions inside this stadium had their rivals speared them at the death.</div>  <div class="TailParas">As it transpired, Celtic failed to convert four or five good chances inside the regulation 90 minutes, yet ironically required just two of the added 30 minutes of extra-time to pave the way to victory through a Darren O&#39;Dea header. The eventual 2-0 outcome was harsh on Rangers, but only in terms of the Ibrox men&#39;s sheer guts and effort. Open, attacking desires Rangers did not have.</div>  <div class="TailParas">On a shambles of a newly-laid Hampden pitch, with players stumbling and sliding over every square yard of it, Rangers were made to pay for their cautious approach. Walter Smith&#39;s game plan was to go with Kenny Miller as a lone striker but for too long it left his side bereft of attacking instincts. Rangers changed their strategy as the match wore on, introducing both Nacho Novo and Kris Boyd and playing a more attacking 4-4-2, but they were to suffer for their earlier dourness.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Rangers had no one to match the squirrelling, unrelenting pest that was Aiden McGeady. The Ireland winger gave Celtic endless energy and ideas, popping up here, there and everywhere to taunt and sometimes humiliate Rangers. There still remains something unfinished about McGeady&#39;s game, but on days like these his oldfashioned tanner ba&#39; skills are a joy for his team-mates and a thorough nightmare for opponents.</div>  <div class="TailParas">In this context, this final reached an apt climax after 118 minutes of sapping football, when McGeady, once more running at Rangers with the ball, scampered past Kirk Broadfoot and into the Rangers area only for the big, clomping defender to trip him. Given his performance, there was only one man to take that penalty for Celtic, and after Broadfoot had received his red card and headed for the tunnel, McGeady calmly pinged the ball past Allan McGregor for Celtic&#39;s second goal.</div>  <div class="TailParas">It was a strange final in the sense that both teams went with lightweight &mdash; not to say midget-like &mdash; strike forces. Celtic, suffering their current dearth of strikers&#39; goals, played McGeady off Scott McDonald in attack, while Rangers played Miller through the middle, with Kyle Lafferty some distance away on the left flank. Given that, in Scottish football, the ball spends quite a bit of time in the air, both attacks were left helpless when it came to an aerial threat.</div>  <div class="TailParas">For too long in the game it just didn&#39;t work for Rangers, and Smith will surely have questioned his game plan of going with Miller alone and isolated, with Lafferty a pained onlooker.</div>  <div class="TailParas">It was a strange strategy that often left both Miller and Lafferty looking frustrated, and only seemed to feed into Celtic&#39;s hands.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Smith had his own reasons for going 4-1-4-1 and leaving Kris Boyd on the bench until the 75th minute, and the Rangers manager has won plenty of football games in the past with formations that others questioned.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Yesterday, however, the system made Rangers impotent for more than an hour. For fully 42 minutes, until Lafferty threw in a shot that Artur Boruc palmed away, Smith&#39;s side looked abject while Celtic created three or four decent chances.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Rangers did eventually change things as the second half wore on, first bringing Novo into the fray after 58 minutes, and then Boyd. And the upshot of these changes was simple and clear: they gave Rangers, now playing 4-4-2, an aggressive edge they had previously lacked.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Strachan had said that, in terms of his fallow strikers, he couldn&#39;t &quot;hang around waiting for something to happen... you have to try to make it happen.&quot; In this context Strachan was true to his word, dropping both Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras to his bench, and playing an eyebrow-raising team, with Glenn Loovens in defence, Gary Caldwell in midfield, and McGeady off McDonald in attack.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Celtic certainly lacked height and physique in attack, but at least they had mobility, and the plan served them well. They took this game to Rangers throughout and thoroughly deserved their win. And McGeady caused all four of Rangers&#39; big defenders quite a toll of anxiety.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Celtic should have taken the lead before they did through O&#39;Dea.</div>  <div class="TailParas">McGeady had already set up McDonald, who volleyed over, and then, from the same creator, Scott Brown volleyed over McGregor&#39;s bar from 14 yards. Loovens then headed over from Shunsuke Nakamura&#39;s high, looping free kick, by which point, just before half-time, Celtic were looking thoroughly dominant. When Brown then crashed a shot a foot over Mc- Gregor&#39;s bar, it left a distinct impression that Celtic&#39;s game plan was proving more effective than that of Rangers.</div>  <div class="TailParas">The most acutely dangerous play Rangers enjoyed after an hour of football came from a bizarre piece of theatrics in his own goalmouth from Boruc. Taking Stephen McManus&#39;s back-pass on the bobbly pitch right in front of his goal, the Celtic goalkeeper attempted a Johan Cruyff-style flick between his ankles, only to slip on the surface and invite Lafferty to lunge in.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Boruc eventually bashed the ball clear, but might easily have conceded a goal. With the game threatening to drift into an agonising penalty shoot-out, O&#39;Dea broke the deadlock two minutes into the extra period. The defender got ahead of Boyd to head Nakamura&#39;s free kick past McGregor.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Then, with the game in its deaththroes and the Celtic fans in full song, McGeady once more ran at Rangers &mdash; this time, at Broadfoot &mdash; and won the penalty. The little winger swept home his side&#39;s second goal with aplomb from the spot.. &quot;Smith had no one to match the squirrelling, unrelenting pest that was Aiden McGeady</div>  <div class="TailParas">(c) 2009 Times Newspapers Limited.

He praised McGeady&#39;s part in the triumph, initially as an auxiliary striker behind lone front man Scott McDonald and then in his more accustomed wide position in the latter stages of the contest.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;Aiden got it right today,&quot; said Strachan. &quot;He played in two different roles. He played as a striker in the first half and then he went wide, because we knew he still had plenty of energy left in him. That&#39;s what he has got, fantastic energy. He did well, because it wasn&#39;t really a running pitch as such. You could see it wasn&#39;t conducive to running, but he got it right today.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">Strachan was even more fulsome in his praise of a less likely hero for Celtic, Republic of Ireland under-21 international central defender Darren O&#39;Dea, who filled in at left-back and headed home the opening goal in the first minute of extra-time.</div>  <div class="TailParas">The 22-year-old had been agitating for temporary leave from Celtic earlier this season as he grew frustrated by his lack of first-team opportunities at the club, but Strachan&#39;s refusal to let him go was spectacularly vindicated for both parties yesterday.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;I couldn&#39;t be more pleased for Darren,&quot; said Strachan. &quot;If anyone deserves something like this, it is him. He has had disappointments this season. He wanted to go out on loan in January, just to become a better player and come back to us as a better player. But I felt we were going to need him between then and the end of the season.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;He was disappointed by that decision, but he didn&#39;t let his disappointment affect himself or the rest of the squad. It is great when you see young men getting the rewards like that. Both of the guys who scored today have come through the club&#39;s academy, which is good for us.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">Strachan caused no little surprise with his team selection and tactical approach yesterday, opting to leave both of his recently misfiring strikers, Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras, on the substitutes&#39; bench.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;I think most things I do in Scotland raise a lot of eyebrows,&quot; added Strachan. &quot;I knew very early in the week how we were going to play. You have to make decisions as a manager and sometimes you make good ones.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;Sometimes you make bad ones, but it worked out alright today.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;I could have gone with Jan up front and I&#39;m sure we would still have won. I could also have gone with Sammy and could have gone with Marc Crosas in midfield. But we explained to them what we were going to try and do and they were good about it. They didn&#39;t let their disappointment affect the squad in any way.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;Forget tactics, it is all about players. I heard all that on Saturday with Manchester United and Liverpool. They both play the same tactics every week, but good players win on the day.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">Strachan identified O&#39;Dea&#39;s goal, heading in a Shunsuke Nakamura free-kick, as the signature moment of Celtic&#39;s victory but admitted he was concerned when his team missed several opportunities to increase their lead before McGeady&#39;s late clincher.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;The free-kick made the difference,&quot; he said. &quot;The delivery of it (by Nakamura) and the bravery (of O&#39;Dea) made the difference. The first goal makes a big difference in these games.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;I liked our composure after we scored the first goal. We didn&#39;t panic when there was a bit of pressure on us.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;We made more chances after that because we were composed. But from the first chance we didn&#39;t take after that, though, I was thinking &#39;here we go&#39;. I thought both sides were up for it. There was a great spirit out there from both teams.</div>  <div class="TailParas">&quot;The result and performance today don&#39;t tell me anything I didn&#39;t know before. I don&#39;t think it makes any difference. All it gives you, as manager of Celtic or Rangers, is a couple of days leeway when you are able to stick your head above the parapet.&quot;</div>  <div class="TailParas">(c) 2009 </div>  <div class="TailParas">The Scotsman</div>  <div class="TailParas">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <h3 class="Title">Celtic grind their way to glory</h3>  <div class="Provided">  <div>16 March 2009</div>Provided by: <a href="reuters://REALTIME/verb=Headlines/ric=%22GPW:IRISEX%5Cs%22" target="_self"><font color="#000099">The Irish Examiner</font></a></div>  <div class="TailParas">  <div class="LeadPara">TRY telling Darren O&rsquo;Dea that the Scottish League Cup is worthless. The Dubliner set aside months of frustration at Celtic to inspire the Bhoys to deserved extra-time triumph at Hampden yesterday and dash Rangers&rsquo; hopes of a clean sweep of domestic trophies.</div>  <div class="LeadPara">After 90 tense but mediocre minutes had failed to produce a goal, O&rsquo;Dea, who had not scored since Celtic beat Livingston in February 2007, leapt to head a Shunsuke Nakamura free-kick past Allan McGregor in the first of the additional 30 minutes.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Then, in the dying seconds, Rangers defender Kirk Broadfoot was red-carded by referee Dougie McDonald for denying McGeady a clear goalscoring opportunity and the Republic of Ireland international scored from the spot.</div>  <div class="TailParas">There was little between the sides in normal time but Celtic&rsquo;s superior fitness paid off and they must take a psychological boost in their bid for their fourth Premier League title in succession, a race in which Celtic lead Rangers by three points.</div>  <div class="TailParas">The extra time eventually brought some drama to an indifferent match but there was plenty to talk about before a ball was kicked.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Celtic manager Gordon Strachan surprisingly dropped both his off-form strikers Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras, leaving McGeady to partner Scott McDonald.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Rangers defender Madjid Bougherra failed to recover from a calf injury, leaving Broadfoot to partner David Weir at the heart of the defence with Lee McCulloch protecting just in front.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Kris Boyd, who had patched up his very public rift with manager Walter Smith which had seen him sent home form training, started on the bench.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Stripped bare of the tribalism which poured down from the packed stands, the first half was little more than mediocre.</div>  <div class="TailParas">The tactical and personnel changes seemed to unsettle both sides and the newly-laid Hampden pitch, which began cutting up from the first whistle, did little to help the flow.</div>  <div class="TailParas">In the 25th minute, with the game slowly suffocating, Hoops&rsquo; bustling midfielder Scott Brown came close when he sent a shot from 25 yards whistling over the bar.</div>  <div class="TailParas">Four minutes later Celtic stopper Glenn Loovens rose highest in a packed six-yard box to meet a deep Nakamura free-kick but directed his header just wide of the far post, seconds before the on-rushing Brown knocked a McGeady cross over the bar.</div>  <div class="TailParas">There was more heat than light generated but two minutes from the break, Celtic goalkeeper Artur Boruc was called into action for the first time and he pulled off a terrific save from Kyle Lafferty&rsquo;s volley, after the Northern Irishman had easily held off Hoops defender Andreas Hinkel.</div>  <div class="TailParas">The second half was marginally more eventful, although ultimately just as frustrating.

Pedro Mendes, but O&#39;Dea, making a rare start, headed in 90 seconds into added time.<br><br>Aiden McGeady added the second from the spot after Kirk Broadfoot was sent off.<br><br>Celtic manager Gordon Strachan had sprung a surprise by giving a first Old Firm start to Loovens, with Gary Caldwell moving forward into midfield and misfiring strikers Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink and Georgios Samaras being left on the bench.<br><br>It looked like it was going to be a midfield war of attrition, with Rangers playing just Kenny Miller up front as Kris Boyd was left on the bench as expected.<br><br>McManus pleased after tough cup victory<br><br>Even without their moody top scorer, it was Rangers who started the brighter and Sasa Papac got in behind the Celtic defence only to be ruled offside.<br><br>But Celtic settled and began to take control to put increasing pressure on a Rangers side denied the speedy presence of in-form Madjid Bougherra, who failed a fitness test.<br><br>Kirk Broadfoot&#39;s return from injury meant a straight swap at the heart of a defence that survived a period of pressure during which Scott Brown fired a long-range effort over the crossbar, McGeady shot across goal and Loovens sent a looping header wide.<br><br>McGeady was causing Steven Whittaker all sorts of problems and, after skipping past the right-back, sent in a low cross that Brown volleyed over from 15 yards.<br><br>Yet it was Rangers who forced the first save of the game a minute before the break on a heavy, re-laid pitch on which players found it difficult to stay on their feet never mind control the ball.<br><br>Smith disappointed with extra-time loss<br><br>Lafferty held off Andreas Hinkel to take the ball on his chest before firing a powerful effort that Boruc turned superbly over the bar at full stretch.<br><br>Rangers also created the first danger of the second half, Steven Davis sending a low drive a few feet wide from the edge of the box.<br><br>Walter Smith had moved Lafferty up front, it was beginning to pay dividends and the Rangers manager brought on fit-again Nacho Novo to partner the Northern Irishman in place of Kenny Miller.<br><br>Lafferty came close to stealing the opener off the toes of Boruc when the goalkeeper tried some fancy footwork before hastily clearing a back-pass in front of his own goal.<br><br>Celtic almost made the breakthrough themselves when David Weir tripped McGeady 20 yards out and McGregor turned Nakamura&#39;s curler aimed at the back post past for a corner.<br>Celtic celebrate Darren O&#39;Dea&#39;s goal<br>O&#39;Dea scored his first goal in two years to put Celtic ahead at Hampden<br><br>The Rangers goalkeeper again did well, beating the ball away after Brown let fly from close range after turning Broadfoot on the six yard line.<br><br>It was Mendes&#39; thigh to the rescue from the resulting corner, clearing off the line from a powerful Loovens header.<br><br>Boruc turned a powerful Novo drive over the crossbar as Boyd, who fell out with his manager after being left on the bench last weekend, prepared to replace Lafferty.<br><br>Rangers had looked the more likely to score in the dying seconds, but Celtic took the lead in extra time when O&#39;Dea&#39;s header from a Nakamura free-kick looped over McGregor.<br><br>Interview: Celtic manager Gordon Strachan<br><br>McDonald and Samaras both squandered chances and McGregor had to tip a Brown pile-driver over the bar as Celtic eased to victory, the goal seemingly having sapped the energy from Rangers&#39; legs and their chances of a domestic treble.<br><br>And, in the dying seconds, Broadfoot clipped the heels of McGeady, the Rangers defender was sent off and the Celtic midfielder dispatched the resulting penalty.<br><br>Celtic : Boruc, Hinkel, Loovens, McManus, O&#39;Dea (Wilson 105), Caldwell, Nakamura, Scott Brown, Hartley (Samaras 72), McGeady, McDonald, Samaras (Vennegoor of Hesselink 120).<br>Subs Not Used: Mark Brown, Crosas.<br><br>Booked : Hinkel, O&#39;Dea, McGeady, Boruc.<br><br>Goals : O&#39;Dea 91, McGeady 120 pen.<br><br>Rangers : McGregor, Whittaker, Weir, Broadfoot, Papac, Davis, McCulloch (Dailly 82), Ferguson, Mendes, Miller (Novo 58), Lafferty (Boyd 76).<br>Subs Not Used: Alexander, Edu.<br><br>Sent Off : Broadfoot (120).

So does that mean we&#39;re both entertaining, brilliant teams now? Make up your mind.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m talking about people in general. That was a good cup final; a one-goal final,&quot; the Celtic manager added.<br><br>Strachan praised his goalscorers, Darren O&#39;Dea and Aiden McGeady, for their displays.<br><br>&quot;Darren wanted to get first-team football and it&#39;s amazing how, in life, if you work hard enough and stick at it, you will get a goal,&quot; he said.<br><br>Interview: Celtic manager Gordon Strachan<br><br>&quot;Aiden played up front to start with and he was effective there.<br><br>&quot;Then he went wide and was effective there. He must be pleased because it wasn&#39;t an easy running surface when you had the ball.<br><br>&quot;We did well and we were brave.&quot;<br><br>O&#39;Dea insisted he was happier getting another game for Celtic than scoring the opener in the Co-operative Insurance Cup final win over Rangers at Hampden.<br> <br>It is good to score in any game, but to score in a cup final is brilliant<br><br>Celtic defender Darren O&#39;Dea<br><br>The 22-year-old, who has struggled to pin down a first team place in recent years, was deputising again at left-back in place of injured Lee Naylor but scored his first goal in two years.<br><br>&quot;It was more special to be playing than to score to be honest with you,&quot; O&#39;Dea said.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve not played as much as I would have liked. Obviously to get a goal is the icing on the cake.<br><br>&quot;It is good to score in any game, but to score in a cup final is brilliant. My last goal was against Livingston in the cup - I think it was my last game as well!<br><br>&quot;Every time I go up I look to score, you don&#39;t just go up to make up the numbers. But I can&#39;t look too far forward. I just want to play in the next game, that&#39;s all I want.&quot;  <br></div></div>
