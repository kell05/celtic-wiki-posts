A talented player with good pace and stamina, many saw a good future for him at Celtic.<br><br>A promising youngster, Liam Miller had been farmed out to ex-Celt Mark Reiper&#39;s Aarhuus side in Denmark in 2001 along with another young Irish Celt, Mike Doyle.<br><br>The high point of his career with Celtic was definitely his goal for Celtic against Lyon in 2003, where he was the final man at the end of a magnificent 24 passing sequence by Celtic of a kind many of us thought could never be achieved by an SPL team, let alone by the Celtic First Team against European opposition. <br><br>On various occasions, if the team needed a boost the cry for &quot;<i>Miller time</i>&quot; (a pun on a popular beer&#39;s advertising catchline) was called for to help out. Fellow players had pointed him out for the future.<br><br>Along with Maloney, Marshall and Kennedy, Liam was expected to be the heart of the young team that would be Celtic&#39;s future. In the Autumn of 2003 he broke through with a fine performance in the 1-0 win over Rangers at Ibrox and two weeks later he was a stand out with two goals in the 5-0 thrashing of Hearts. He had several outstanding games in Europe, scoring another spectacular goal <span class="diffAdd">this time </span>against Anderlecht, and Martin O&#39;Neill came under fire for not playing him in what was to be the crucial Champions League defeat in Lyon in December 2003.<br><br>The main problem was that he was injury prone, which held back his career and when the crunch time came for contract negotiations, a variety of events and issues led to his move to Man U (the club he supported as a boy along with Celtic), simply he was poached. Man U were willing to pay him higher and for a longer contract, and <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> weren&#39;t willing to (due to his continuous injuries), and the result is viewed differently depending on which side you&#39;re on. <br><br>In fairness, Celtic were likely a bit slack in tying him up on a good contract although it was reported that he had been offered a contract worth &pound;20,000 per week in October and had stalled on it for three months. The resulting furore amongst Celtic fans about loyalty and so on didn&#39;t help the club, but his move thankfully did not affect the First Team on the pitch (although a transfer fee would have been nice).<br><br>In the Spring of 2004 he was recalled into the squad and made a few appearances as substitute and was roundly jeered by a large section of the Celtic support. This was understandable as they were deeply aggrieved not at his leaving but in the manner of his leaving, especially as the club had supported him through his many injuries between the age of 16 and 21. The fans regarded this as an act of treason, some even branded him unnecessarily as a &#39;Judas&#39;.<br><br>Alex Ferguson (Man U manager) had high hopes for him: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;We recognised the potential of Liam, he has had a great season at Celtic. He is very much part of our progressive thinking of developing a young team over the next few years.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>In any case, his move to Manchester Utd didn&#39;t work out and he moved on to Sunderland at the start of the 2006-07 season after a loan spell at Leeds. Despite starting well under the management of Roy Keane his performances soon fell away and he was moved on in January 2009. He took a short contract with QPR but was released at the end of the season. His international career was on the same kind of downward spiral.<br><br>In September 2009 he joined Hibernian as a free agent and recovered his career, however again that move didn&#39;t work out long-term and he moved on to Perth (Australia) in 2011, and after a spell going round clubs in Australia he was back in Ireland playing with Cork City. He later enjoyed a spell in the US. So what he may have lacked in any honours, he made up with in airmiles.<br><br>A sad loss at the end of what was potentially a very good player for Celtic. If only he had stayed at Celtic, he could have got himself more appearances, a longer run out and thus more experience to build on what was once a precocious talent, but that&#39;s another story.<br><br><h3>Passing Away</h3>Sadly, in Nov 2017, it was publicly announced that he had cancer, so any past indiscretions were now all by-the-by, and all were behind him in the hope of a recovery.<br><br>He was to pass away soon after in Feb 2018, prematurely dying at the young age of 36 leaving behind a wife and three children. It hit everyone hard, and our sympathies and respect were with his family at this difficult time.<br><br><div>Black armbands were worn at the following Celtic match (v Partick Thistle) and a minute silence was respected and held in his memory. Across all the clubs he played for there was a lot of respect paid his way, and he will be remembered for some fine moments for his Celtic performances in the Champions League, most notably matches against Anderlecht &amp; Lyon in particular.</div><div></div><div><br>A benefit game was held in Cork to help raise funds for his family between a Manchester United legends team managed by Roy Keane and a combined Celtic/Ireland side managed by Martin O&#39;Neil. Interestingly, it created a little history as the game was being held at a GAA ground in Cork, who having initially vetoed the ideas (as &#39;soccer&#39; is a foreign game), the GAA authorities were forced to backtrack after the backlash from all corners.</div><br>Imagine saying to a young boy from Cork that one day he&rsquo;d play for  Celtic, Man U, Leeds, Ireland&#39;s national side and Cork City, as well as then getting spells across sides in the US &amp; Australia. That&rsquo;s more life than most  of us will manage.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7"

I dreamed of  playing for Man United and I got that opportunity as well. I don&rsquo;t know  how many other people can say they played for their two childhood clubs,  or even one childhood club.&quot; <br><b>Liam Miller<br></b><br>&quot;Long before Celtic, Man U &amp; Ireland, Liam Miller was almost a  mythical figure in Cork schoolboy football. Can&rsquo;t overstate his impact. I  didn&rsquo;t know him but we all knew about him, heard about where he was on  trial, what club was in for him. Then we watched him live out our  dreams.&quot;<br><b>Kieran McSweeney on Twitter</b><br><br>&quot;And while we&#39;re talking about Next Big Things That Never Quite Happened, we ought to mention that Sheffield United are planning a bid for Liam Miller - you know, the new-Roy-Keane-except-he&#39;s-half-the-size-and-a-bit-rubbish.&quot; <br><b>Guardian July 2006</b><br><br>&quot;Liam Miller leaving was a devastating blow for everybody. He was such a talented lad and him being allowed to leave was very disappointing for people who are working down below. You get some talent and all of a sudden it&#39;s away, &agrave; la Maloney, which was the same thing.&quot;<br><b>Tommy Burns Apr 2006</b><br><br>&quot;I put Liam Miller on the transfer list. He was late too often. I was sick of the excuses and I told him I&#39;d had enough of it. His agent rang me to tell me that Liam lived on a busy junction and it was hard to get out.&quot;<br><b>Roy Keane in his biog on Miller</b><br><br>&quot;It happened so quickly. It wasn&rsquo;t like I knew they were interested for weeks or months, or anything like that. It was around the January transfer window so I went down and was shown around Carrington and spoke to everyone at the club.<br>&quot;It was hugely impressive. Anyone would find it impressive. An opportunity like that doesn&rsquo;t come around too often. Looking back, I thought it would be a great place to go and play football.&quot;<br><b>Liam Miller on move to Man U (2016) <br>(source: <a class="external" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2623619-former-manchester-united-man-liam-miller-on-old-trafford-and-new-life-in-the-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2623619-former-manchester-united-man-liam-miller-on-old-trafford-and-new-life-in-the-us</a>)</b><br><br>&quot;Hindsight is a great word.

Looking back, I have played for some fabulous clubs and I certainly don&rsquo;t reflect back and wish I had done anything different. I have no regrets over leaving Celtic when I did. It was the right move for me at that time. I grew up supporting Celtic and Man United and I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to play for those two clubs. When you go to a club like Manchester United&mdash;one of the top three clubs in the world&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t really get much bigger. <br>&quot;I was used to the pressure of having to win every week at Celtic, but it still doesn&rsquo;t prepare you for what is demanded of you at United.

(He did spend a season in Copenhagen but I seem to remember he was injured for a lot of that season as well).<br><br>During pre-season 2003-2004 he played, and played well, in a number of the friendlies. He was going into the third year of a three year contract. He started the season well and in August MON started to negotiate a new contract with him and his agent. (Given his previous six seasons of non-contribution and terrible injury record I don&#39;t think MON could have been accused of dithering at that point.)<br><br>In October Miller shook hands with MON on a new three year contract. All that was needed was the agent to appear to finalise the signing of the papers.<br><br>At the stage the agent disappeared and couldn&#39;t seem to find the time to travel to Glasgow. In Ireland rumours of a move by that shower from Manchester were starting - even in the media.<br><br>End of October Miller plays a stormer against Anderlecht at CP, his best game for Celtic imo - in Scotland the media wondered who Sir Bollix was up watching. Even when he left after Miller was subbed they couldn&#39;t figure it out! In Ireland the headlines were &#39;Miller for Old Trafford&#39;.<br><br>Through November, as reported by Celtic, the agent still wasn&#39;t available. Miller was telling us every day in the press how he loved Celtic and wanted to stay.<br><br>In December he pissed off to Manchester and signed the contract.<br><br>There are many things Celtic &amp; MON can be criticised for - not signing up Liam Miller soon enough though is not one of them. The villains of the piece were quite clearly Miller himself, the agent and Sir Bollix - and even the great Keano was involved a wee bit.<br><br>Be that all as it may. I remember posting at the time that I was glad it was someone else paying him &pound;20K a week and not us. The guy had talent but imo was always too weak and too injury-prone to justify those type of wages from us. Nothing that has happened since has changed my mind.&quot;<br><b>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>(Torquemeda of KDS forum June 2011)</b><br><br>  Anyone who says Liam Miller wouldn&#39;t have made it at Celtic is suffering from Jilted Lover syndrome. He was a terrific prospect and I was sick when he left. Some blame the club but I blame more his arsehole of an agent, a guy called Fintan Drury who worked in the RTE sports department (better known as the ManUre Supporters Club West) and who wanted nothing more than to have a ManUre player on his burgeoning sports agency&#39;s books. Miller was not the first young player to have his head turned by an unscupulous agent and won&#39;t be the last.<br><br>In my view, he would have been a mainstay in the Celtic midfield for years. The move to ManUre came way before he was ready for it, and any subsequent career failures can be put down to the loss of confidence that that particular failure created for him. ( I&#39;m sure in his quiet moments he shakes his head in bewilderment at where it went wrong. It wasn&#39;t all bad. I recall a game at Lansdowne Road when Ireland stuffed Sweden (Henke et al) 3-0 and Miller bossed the midfield, scoring a 30-yarder in the process.<br><br>And I&#39;m always amazed (and amused) at the difference in reaction to Miller and Maloney, whose treachery in spinning us all on for nine months when we all knew he was on his bike sticks in my craw still. If Villa&#39;s manager hadn&#39;t been MON, we wouldn&#39;t have got a cent for the little two-faced sod. But for some reason that I could not even guess at KDS seems to have a blind spot when it comes to Malaysians!  <b>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>Liam Miller</h3>Source: Not The View <a class="external" href="http://www.ntvcelticfanzine.com/farewell+then/fwl+miller.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Link</a><br><br>So farewell then Liam Miller, the latest in a long list of players who come to Celtic, make their name then float off down south (Pierre, Di Canio, Viduka...).<br><br>The really galling thing about this departure is that he was meant to be one of our own. He was a product of the youth set up, and when no one else would touch him because of injuries we saw him through.<br><br>Miller made his debut on the last day of season 1999-2000, the day Dalglish gave the boys their chance. Like most of the youngsters that day he looked alright. Kenny had played his last card well. The fans went home confident about the future of the club having seen the kids win 2:0.<br><br>But the next season was a complete washout because of injury, just as his previous season had been. In order to rehabilitate him he was sent to Denmark to play for Aarhus under Mark Rieper. He impressed them so much that they tabled a bid to buy him but Celtic resisted insisting that his future lay at Celtic Park.<br><br>He started to make a first team impact at the end of last season, providing some much needed guile in the midfield and stemming any talk of having to fork out X million pounds for a new midfielder.<br><br>He started this season like a train, scoring and creating some fine goals. His manager was keen to use and to protect him, reminding fans that it wasn&#39;t really fair to expect Miller to be controlling Champions League games with the amount of limited experience he had. Yet some of his performances suggested he could do just that.<br><br>Celtic have been running a goal of the season competition in recent weeks, but we all know that the real goal of the season isn&#39;t included; Liam Miller at home to Lyon. More than 20 passes from one side of the pitch to another, from back to front, before a killer cross and scoring header. You can&#39;t beat it, but it isn&#39;t in the list, because regardless of how fine a goal it is it hurts to see it now.<br><br>After another master class and goal against Anderlecht his game went decidedly downhill. The press were asking why we hadn&#39;t signed the boy up yet. OFM was cool about it. He told the press that talks had begun and an offer was on the table. Liam hadn&#39;t made any noises about being unhappy with the offer, he expected him to sign it.<br><br>Then just two days after the New Year demolition of Rangers (Miller replaced Hartson as a sub), with every Celtic fan on top of the world he brought the whole show crashing to earth. Not only would he be leaving, but also because he would have turned 23 by the time the season ended we would receive nothing for him. The press were ecstatic. Celtic had been put in their place. This kind of thing never happened to Rangers (because they haven&#39;t produced anyone good enough, but forget that for now), it&#39;s all the board&#39;s fault, O&#39;Neill must leave after this etc. etc.<br><br>On top of all this it overshadowed the signing of Stephen Pearson, a young player who wants to play for Celtic, but made sure that he didn&#39;t sign a pre-contract so as to ensure that Motherwell got some recompense for bringing him up as a player.<br><br>One reason for his dip in form had been that Man U had contacted him right after the Anderlecht game. Of course Miller then began his &#39;I&#39;ve always supported Man U&#39; stuff, even having the cheek to say &#39;I&#39;ve given Celtic 6 years&#39;! Given six years? Taken more like.<br><br>The rumour mill, of course, went into overdrive, although the most interesting thing was that the board took no real criticism. They had made the boy a fair offer, an offer the manager approved of. The point of betrayal was Liam Miller himself.<br><br>Immediately after his departure was announced it was revealed that he wouldn&#39;t play for some time due to injury. Conspiracy theorists had a laugh at that. Initially the reaction of many had been that he should never wear the shirt again, but that soon gave way to the school of thought that we wanted to let him know exactly what we thought of his actions.<br><br>His appearances have always provoked a mixed reaction, some booing a Celtic player (which is a sure fire way to kick off a heated argument) some cheering him. He was allowed to lift the league trophy, though God only knows why, but surely he won&#39;t be part of the 16 for the cup final, that would be appalling.<br><br>At the age of 23 - hardly a &#39;young player&#39; - he&#39;s managed less than 25 first team games, and now he&#39;s decided that Old Trafford is his next logical step. Quite who is to make way from him is another matter, especially when you consider that established international midfielders, who aren&#39;t chronically injury prone, are handing in transfer requests due to lack of first team opportunity at Old Trafford.<br><br>Normally we finish these things with &#39;We wish him well,&#39; but I just can&#39;t do it because I&#39;m not sure that I do. He&#39;s stabbed us all in the back and I just can&#39;t forgive him.<br><br>AB MURDOCH  <b>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>Liam Miller gave Celtic fans some great memories &ndash; let&rsquo;s hope he gets the chance to make a lot more</h3><div class="author-details"><div class="author-name-container"><a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/author/profile/76063.Neil_Cameron/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">Neil Cameron</font></a> <br>Nov 2017 </div></div><div class="article-row-container"><div class="article-row-container-left"><div>             <div class="article-hero light-background"> <a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/15659767.Neil_Cameron__L" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/15659767.Neil_Cameron__L</a></div><div class="article-hero light-background">iam_Miller_gave_Celtic_fans_some_great_memories_____let___s_</div><div class="article-hero light-background">hope_he_gets_the_chance_to_make_a_lot_more/</div>Liam Miller (centre) runs away to celebrate after scoring with Chris Sutton and Didier Agathe (right) ready to join in<div class="article-credits clearfix"></div><div></div><div class="article-body"><div>  IT was so appropriate Liam Miller&rsquo;s best game in a <a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/search/?search=Celtic&topic_id=8739" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">Celtic</font></a> jersey came on Bonfire Night.   His breath-taking performance in a thrilling Champions League match at Parkhead against Lyon was like a firework in that he sparked, left the punters eyes and mouths wide open in wonder and then it was all over far too soon.   Miller played only 26 games for Celtic; however, the skinny Cork lad made one hell of an impact. <br><br><div><div class="advert-container"><div></div></div>  His name was known before the 2003/04 season when, at the fairly old age of 22, Martin O&rsquo;Neill threw him into the first-team. The Irishman played in a winning side at Ibrox, and he played well, scored in that European match against Lyon and in a home tie with Anderlecht.   Why it had taken him so long to get noticed was partly due to injury problems, he had more than his fair share as a kid, and also O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s renowned reluctance to look to less established players. <br><br>  Indeed, Miller was in the last year of his contract, he was quickly offered a long-term deal, but soon there were rumblings that he could be off at the end of that season on a Bosman. Such rumours were to prove accurate.   In the New Year it was revealed Miller had signed for Manchester United, the team he&rsquo;d supported to the extent the number 43 he wore at Celtic was in honour of Eric Cantona. You do the arithmetic. <br><br>  I recall at the time thinking it would hard for anyone to turn down Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester United but that he would struggle to get a game, and that&#39;s what happened. If it can ever be a mistake to sign for such a great manager and massive club, then this was it.   Had he stayed, there is every chance Miller would have become a Celtic great. He showed more than enough in less than 30 games that he had it in him. <br><br>  Ach, but ask yourself this. What would you have done? Okay, Miller didn&rsquo;t become the next Roy Keane, but went on to have a more than decent career, probably made a right few quid, and the fans of Sunderland in particular have hugely fond memories of the midfielder who helped Keane&rsquo;s team win the Championship. <br><br><div class="advert-container"><div></div></div>  Let&rsquo;s go back to that night a smidgeon over 14 years ago &ndash; now there&rsquo;s a thought &ndash; and Celtic&rsquo;s 2-0 win over Lyon. Parkhead under the floodlights is pretty special and that night beat most. For me, it&rsquo;s in my top five games I&rsquo;ve ever watched in the ground.   From start to finish, the crowd sang and the stands bounced. There was a coat of paint between two attacking teams, and in the first half, Alan Thompson missed a penalty, just to add to the drama.   It had been reported that Paul Le Guen, then Lyon manager, had questioned Henrik Larsson as a player and so the Swede&rsquo;s feathers were ruffled. He went onto have one of those games which had those responsible for the marks out of ten wondering if he could sneak a 9.9 into the paper. <br><br><div></div>  In the second-half, he received the ball from Jackie McNamara, pulled off a step-over which bamboozled his &ldquo;marker&rdquo; and the resultant cross was headed home by Miller, the smallest man on the park. <br><br>  Larsson repeated his trick not long afterwards and this time Chris Sutton was the man. However, after the game, we all wanted to talk to Miller.   And, so, this 22-year-old, he looked 15, stood in front of whatever the collective noun for Scottish football writers is (a bawbaggery?) as we barked questions at him. <br><br><div class="advert-container"><div></div></div>  Miller mumbled some answers in the thickest Irish accent ever, this was well out of his comfort zone, and no matter how much we tried, this wasn&rsquo;t a lad prepared to sing his own praises. He was quiet, shy and modest. It was difficult not to really take to him.   And now this awfy nice husband and father is fighting pancreatic cancer, which serves as a reminder that life is a million miles from fair.   Nobody has a bad word to say about the man.   I hope with all my heart Miller can beat this. He gave 60,000 people including myself some wonderful memories that Bonfire Night.   It would be only right if he got the chance to make a lot more memories for his family. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div></div></div></div><h3>  Liam Miller: Former Celtic and Manchester United midfielder dies aged 36</h3><br> http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43011780<br><br>Liam Miller<br>Tributes paid to Miller on Friday described him as &quot;a gentleman, a friend and a great player&quot;<br><br>Former Celtic and Manchester United midfielder Liam Miller has died at the age of 36.<br><br>Miller, who won 21 caps for the Republic of Ireland between 2004 and 2009, had been suffering from cancer.<br><br>Miller started his career at Celtic in 2000 before moving to Old Trafford four years later, also playing for Leeds, Sunderland, QPR and Hibernian.<br><br>Celtic said they were &quot;deeply saddened&quot;, adding their &quot;thoughts are with his family and friends&quot;.<br><br>BBC Scotland pundit Tam McManus, who played with Miller at Hibs, tweeted: &quot;I&#39;m afraid it is true that Liam Miller has sadly passed away today.

A product of the Celtic Youth Academy, the Irishman made his  competitive Hoops bow as a 19-year-old in a 2-0 win over Dundee United  in May 2000.  But the midfielder made his big breakthrough into the senior side in  the 2003/04 season, following a profitable loan spell with Danish club  AGF Aarhus.  In July of that year, he opened his account for the club in a 3-0  away victory against Kaunas in a UEFA Champions League qualifier. A few  months later, the Cork-born player also found the net in a memorable 2-0  triumph over Lyon in the group stages of the competition.  After making 44 first-team appearances for the Bhoys, Liam, by then a  full Irish internationalist, joined Manchester United in the summer of  2004, having signed a pre-contract with the Old Trafford side.  Along the Red Devils, he also starred for Leeds United, Sunderland,  Queens Park Rangers and Hibernian, before continuing his football career  in Australia, enjoying spells at Perth Glory, Brisbane Roar and  Melbourne City.  After a year with hometown club Cork City, Liam headed to the United  States in 2016, and joined North Carolina based-team Wilmington  Hammerheads.  The thoughts and prayers of everyone at the club and the Celtic  family are with Liam&rsquo;s family and friends at this deeply sad time.  To pay tribute to Liam, a minute&rsquo;s silence will be held before  tomorrow&rsquo;s Scottish Cup tie with Partick Thistle and the Celtic team  will also wear black armbands. </div>					 						 						 							<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  A TRIBUTE TO LIAM MILLER</h3>by St Anthony<br>18/10/03 SPL CELTIC v HEARTS CELTIC PARK - GLASG0W Celtic&#39;s Liam Miller second celebration<br>http://celticunderground.net/a-tribute-to-liam-miller/<br>Every Celtic fan will have been devastated to hear of the news of Liam Miller&rsquo;s sad passing from illness at the age of only 36.<br><br>Liam was originally spotted while playing in Cork as an under14 for Ballincollig Boys Club by Mick Conroy, the popular Celtic player of the late 1970&rsquo;s and early 1980&rsquo;s, who was coaching there. The young Liam immediately impressed Celtic youth team officials when he went to Glasgow for a one-week trial on Conroy&rsquo;s recommendation.<br><br>Having signed for the Celts, who he had supported as a boy, he made steady progress through the underage ranks with Celtic youth coach, Willie McStay, marking him out as someone who was a &lsquo;little bit special&rsquo;.<br><br>Liam&rsquo;s growing reputation was enhanced in the summer of 1998 when Ireland astonished the football world by winning the UEFA under 16 European Championships which were held in Scotland. Ireland beat Spain and Portugal along the way and then Italy in the final. played at McDiarmid Park. Celtic were fortunate to have two young Irishman on their books from that winning team, Liam and Jim Goowin.<br><br>He made his first team debut on the last day of the season back in 2000 in a 2-0 win against Dundee United on the day Henrik Larsson made a dramatic return from injury. Other young hopefuls, Goodwin, Brian McColligan, John Convery and Ryan McCann also made their debuts that day where it is reckoned Celtic fielded their youngest ever side under the careful eye of caretaker manager, Kenny Dalglish.<br><br>Liam was expected to push on and make an impact during the campaign that followed. Instead, hampered by injuries, he remained a peripheral figure, making just one more appearance in the 12 months that followed. A six month loan spell in Denmark with AGF Aarhus then came, at the end of which Marc Rieper, the former Celtic defender, then managing the Danish outfit, came close to landing the youngster for just &pound;300,000.<br><br>Ireland&rsquo;s youth manager, Brian Kerr, talked to Liam and his family at that time regarding the player&rsquo;s growing frustration at his lack of progress, and he returned to Celtic Park in the hope his chance would finally come.<br><br>Liam&rsquo;s big break came in the summer of 2003 when Celtic played Arsenal in a prestigious friendly game. The result was 1-1 with Liam scoring Celtic&rsquo;s goal with an excellent shot on the turn. Paul Lambert sustained an injury shortly after and Liam was given an extended run in Martin O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s team that autumn.<br><br>His first big break came when he came on as a substitute against Lyon at Parkhead in the Champions League and scored the opening goal in a 2-0 win with a header following a scintillating move. Days later he started at Ibrox in difficult circumstances. Celtic won 1-0 and Liam was said to have played like a veteran. He had added much needed pace and directness to Celtic&rsquo;s midfield and he was an excellent passer of the ball. The midfield duo of Miler and Petrov was reckoned to be the cornerstone of O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Celtic team for the future.<br><br>Another spectacular Champions League goal was netted by Liam against Anderlecht in a 3-1 home victory. In the away game in Brussels Liam was controversially left out as Celtic went down 1-0 and, somewhat unusually, Martin O&rsquo;Neill was heavily criticised by the support for leaving Liam out of the team.<br><br>On January 3rd 2004, Liam was part of the Celtic team who thrashed Rangers 3-0 at Celtic Park. He was now in the last 6 months of his contract and although Celtic had a deal on the table since October, nothing had been signed. Manchester United manager, Alex Ferguson, saw his chance and persuaded Liam to sign a pre contract for United, just days after the victory over Rangers.<br><br>Celtic fans were unhappy at what the regarded as disloyalty and Liam lost his place in the team. He made sporadic appearances towards the end of the season but left quietly for Old Trafford in the summer of 2004.<br><br>It&rsquo;s reckoned that Liam was heavily persuaded to join United by his fellow Cork man, Roy Keane. Sadly, the move never worked out and after that Liam moved clubs regularly with moves to Leeds, Sunderland, Hibs added to spells in Australian football and the USA.<br><br>However, it remains a great source of regret to Celtic fans that Liam did not stay longer at Parkhead to develop is talents and allow us to further enjoy his energetic and enthusiastic displays in the hoops.<br><br>Liam Miller is survived by his wife Clare and his three children Kory, Leo and Belle and the thoughts and prayers of every Celtic fan are with them at this difficult time.<br><br>It was a great pleasure to have witnessed Liam Miller playing for Celtic.<br><br>Eternal rest grant unto him O Lord and may eternal light shine upon him.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Obituary: Liam Miller fulfilled two boyhood dreams</h3><div class="article__meta">                                 				                                 				<div class="article-meta__byline ">                                         <div class="article-meta__byline-info-container">                         <div class="article-meta__byline-name-container">                                                             RONNIE ESPLIN                                                     </div>                         <div class="article-meta__byline-contact-list">                                                                         </div>                      </div> 				</div> 								  				                  								 				<div class="article-meta__timestamp article-meta__timestamp--same-day">                                              Published:                         23:10                                                      Saturday 10 February 2018                                                                   					 				</div>				 		</div>  	<br><br>Former Celtic, Manchester United,  Hibernian and Republic of Ireland midfielder Liam Miller, who died on  Friday night at the age of 36 from pancreatic cancer, fulfilled two  boyhood dreams.
