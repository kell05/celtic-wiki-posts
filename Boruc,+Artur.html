A great start on how to describe any player to have played for us  but who or what is the man that lies behind the song? <br><br>When  Boruc was signed for Celtic we were never to know what to expect. One  Polish colleague of this writer warned after he&rsquo;d signed for us that he  was a great goalkeeper with a bad habit of losing his concentration and  was a bit of a maverick. So were we to get the same? Boruc early on said  at one point that he was only interested in his home club Legia Warsaw  (doing the &quot;L&quot; sign with his thumb and index finger which referenced  them), and this created a mini hoo-haa, and he wished the atmosphere at  Celtic was like as it was at Legia Warsaw. (in fairness the home atmosphere at  Celtic was dipping until the emergence of the Green Brigade). <br><br>He  actually ended up helping to bring back some colour to matches and in  time he was to love the club as much as the support itself. If anything he was a catalyst to the rebirth of the Celtic atmosphere.<br><br>First  task for Boruc was to bite his tongue and wait (an admittedly difficult  task for him) as David Marshall was the no.1 in goals. Poor form, bad  luck and injury pushed David Marshall behind Boruc who took advantage.  Early performances demonstrated a confident (even arrogant) goalkeeper  who just seemed to be the answer to our goalkeeping dreams. For some  reason, Celtic had not been blessed with many exceptional goalkeepers  post-WW2, and to finally have two (potentially) was a bit of a shock to  the system. David Marshall was a very good keeper, but Boruc was  something more, and in time Marshall sadly had to move on for the  benefit of his own career.<br><br>So how did it all turn out for Boruc?  Crazy that&#39;s how! Packed full of incidents both on and off the park and  then more back on the park. Not since McAvennie or Di Canio have we had a  character like Boruc, and that is always a mixed blessing. One major  difference between them and Boruc is that Boruc ended up repeatedly  getting involved in the divide issue between Rangers and ourselves, and  in that made himself tabloid fodder. He shrugged it all off, due to  naivety, arrogance and humour.<br><br>But what about his ability? If you  want a measure of the quality of his goalkeeping skills, then possibly  the best example is his performances for his national side (Poland). In  Euro 2008, he was probably the most lauded of all goalkeepers in the  tournament despite Poland getting knocked out in the group stages. A  great performance between the sticks against Germany bestowed on him  hero status despite a late winner for the Germans. Nevertheless, he&rsquo;d  made a name for himself, and others beyond Parkhead were noticing his  undoubted talents. He got nicknamed &ldquo;Spaceman&rdquo; for these performances by  the German press.<br><br>His greatest performances for Celtic? Well,  there were loads of great saves and cheeky moments to make us smile and  laugh. However, the penalty shoot-out v Spartak Moscow in the Champions  League where he was immense and saved penalties to take us through was  an amazing highlight. Only a truly world class keeper would have done as  well as he did, and that he was. Best memory was his quirky little bird  dance after saving the final penalty. <br><br>But there were so many  more moments. One of the most dramatic for Boruc was in the Champions  League in 2006-07, when Celtic played Man U in the group stages.  Unfairly adjudged by the referees to have conceded a penalty to Ryan  Giggs in the first match, in the second match v Man U a second penalty  was again conceded late in the match (by Shaun Maloney) to help pull Man  U back in. However, Boruc wonderfully and confidently saved the penalty  to make many a Man U fan sick and send our support into raptures as  Celtic went on to win 1-0 and qualify out of the group stages for the  first time. Add some more further great saves in the game and you had a  developing great player who was making the support proud to have him as  one of our own.<br><br>Just strange that we had finally an incredible  world class keeper. For some reason, Celtic had not been blessed with  many great goalkeepers since the retirement of Ronnie Simpson. Boruc was  so good, that in October 2008, he was one of 55 players shortlisted for  the FIFPro World XI Player Awards, a well won achievement.<br><br>He  had his flaws. For some reason the team went one whole season without a  clean sheet in an away game in the 90mins, with one exception, and that  was incredibly the Milan away match in the Champions League (although we  conceded in extra-time). He had a poor habit of losing his  concentration in some matches and could be the difference between 3pts  due to his saves and none through a lackadaisical attitude. This stemmed  in many ways from the strong point of his arrogance and  self-confidence, but it was at times his Achilles heel. On the other  hand, he had to play behind a defence which never settled or been  organised properly, so maybe a better defence would have brought out the  best in him. Didn&#39;t happen with our defence in much of Boruc&rsquo;s time at  Celtic.<br><br><b>Controversies and dramas...</b><br>It can&rsquo;t be avoided, so what about the controversies?  There were many (mostly silly). Youth, naivety and arrogance (again)  were a mixture which created explosions in Scotland. <br><br>One of the  first overblown controversies (sic!) was when he arrived, he was  repeatedly doing an &ldquo;L&rdquo; sign to supports with his thumb &amp;  forefinger. In some places (in particular the US) this means &ldquo;LOSER&rdquo; and  some opposition fans translated it as that. Cheeky but not true. He is a  big Legia Warsaw fan and that is their sign apparently. Daft but funny.  <br><br>However, the most controversial episodes followed matches v  Rangers. Firstly, was when he offended Rangers&#39; fans. Not a difficult  thing to do, so what was it he did? When he was in goals, he blessed  himself! You read that right, he simply blessed himself, and the next  thing you know it got blown out the water. He wasn&rsquo;t going to stop doing  it and why should he? What&rsquo;s the offence in it? None at all, and  Rangers&#39; fans were making up nonsense and the guy was at the centre of  it. Bizarrely, he was cautioned by the police for it. It reflected  poorly on Scotland and really embarrassed the government and it even  went far with the news travelling abroad (not exactly good for the  national tourist board). The Celtic support summarised it well with a  banner in support of Boruc: &quot;<i>Blessing yourself is not a crime!</i>&quot;.<br><br>From that last incident was born the &ldquo;<i>Holy Goalie</i>&rdquo;  legend with the respective songs, and he was a <i>cause c&eacute;lebre</i> for the  Celtic support, possibly our biggest idol since Henke (but in a very  different way to Henke). The songs became the most sung by the support  and he didn&#39;t half love the attention.<br><br><img align="right" alt="Boruc sticks it to the Huns (31 Aug 08)" height="368" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/nFT5NmA4nFRt81dA9wZUoA19247/GW276H368" title="Boruc sticks it to the Huns (31 Aug 08)" width="276">Little  did Rangers&#39; fans know that Boruc was about to be their biggest  nemesis. Some great performances punctured their egos, and he liked to  carry on winding them up. As one arch-Hun tried to cry-wolf: <i>&quot;The man is a maverick and out of control. Something must be done about his actions&rdquo;</i>.  It was comical, and the episodes carried on. Boruc wore a Pope t-shirt  at another game v Rangers, again prompting mock outrage and horror from  their supporters, and at another match flew a Celtic flag at Ibrox.  There were other stories as well, including an unnecessary middle finger  raised to the Rangers&#39; fans after a 4-2 defeat in 2008.<br><br>In  truth, Boruc played up to the worst of the controversies and just let it  happen whilst he just sat back and laughed at the reaction. The  Rangers&#39; fans are just a joke and Boruc played them like a fiddle. Not  all were happy, and he was even chastised by a few sections of the  Celtic support who wanted him to just concentrate on his game rather  than winding up the hordes from Rangers. <br><br>One problem that arose  was that in many ways being the cult hero meant that too many turned a  blind eye to some of his performances and antics. It&rsquo;s not always for  the best. McAvennie back in the 80s suffered at the end due to a similar  situation at West Ham and Celtic.<br><br><b>The final seasons...</b><br>Season 2008/09 was a nadir for  Boruc. Too little went right that season. He became too much of a media  staple after marital problems and then post-split affairs went public,  but add in some silly antics (daft tattoos and lady issues) and giving  the Rangers&#39; fans the finger at the end of a game v Rangers and you can  see that he was pushing the boundaries. His form was dipping sharply and  with no competition (only the hapless Mark Brown as reserve keeper) and  he had little incentive to buckle up. Gordon Strachan (manager) should  have booted Boruc up the backside but seemed not to. We lost the league  but Boruc wasn&rsquo;t the simple reason why we did but his form didn&rsquo;t help. <br><br>Out  of shape and of form, but it wasn&rsquo;t just Celtic for whom things were  going wrong. In August 2008 Boruc, along with his national team mates  Dariusz Dudka and Radosław Majewski, were suspended from the team for  breaching a curfew after Poland&#39;s loss in a friendly against Ukraine, a  game in which Boruc had not played. Most heated was a game v N  Ireland,  where Polish immigrants were increasingly being treated like mince, and  Boruc was at the end of the worst treatment in a hot headed match.  Sadly Boruc was woeful and conceded goals he shouldn&rsquo;t have.<br><br>Must  add that not all was bad in that season. Remarkably he became likely  one of the first Celtic goalkeepers to have ever scored a goal for the  club, scoring in a marathon penalty shoot-out against Dundee Utd in a  League Cup semi-final. Bizarrely, it was the best penalty of the night  by far and put our strikers to shame.<br><br>Season 2009/10 was not much of an  improvement, and despite having Zaluska as reserve goalkeeper, he was  never in much danger of losing his place. When Zaluska did deputise for  Boruc, we suffered some of our worst results (4-0 loss to St Mirren). In  the final quarter of the season, Boruc had a good return to form,  partly attributable to the departure of Tony Mowbray as manager and  Neill Lennon coming in as caretaker manager. <br><br>Must add that apparently he was said to have won a &quot;<i>Save of the Season</i>&quot;  award from somewhere. We had a good run at the end, and Boruc played  his part, but the season was a disaster. Frustratingly, Boruc remained a  staple in the tabloid media spotlight (e.g. drink, women, relationship  stuff etc etc). Some of which was proven to be false with tabloids  having to retract and apologise. Still, it didn&#39;t help his concentration  on the job.<br><br>It was time for the adventure to end, and on 15 July  2010, Boruc sealed a move to Fiorentina for an undisclosed fee  (estimated at &pound;1.7m). The Holy Goalie, a much loved Celtic character,  had left the building. Maybe he had now served his time and his best at  Celtic was behind him. With only one season left, the club decided to  cash in. Didn&#39;t stop a vocal minority to continue to want him back at  every opportunity.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>He had a successful time across Fiorentina, Southampton and Bournemouth after Celtic, and even won a Supporters Player of the year in 2016-17 at Bournemouth. His only major honour post-Celtic was helping Bournemouth to a Football League Championship title in 2014-15, their first ever promotion to the top tier in England.<br><br><br><b>Post-Playing Career<br></b>So where to for Boruc  from here? Who knows? He&rsquo;s a cult personality at  Celtic and will be  forever loved, likely more for his character than  anything else, but he  was an excellent keeper. At his best, world  class. <br><br>If anything,  the combination of being both a great  character as well as a great  player helped to boost the Green Brigade,  as both fed off each other and  in some way the Green Brigade owe a debt  to him. He was probably their  first key cult player who helped fuel  their development as a group, and  in turn their support helped to boost  Boruc too.<br><br>He made us all  smile and will forever be welcome at  Celtic  Park, and he grew to love  the club as much as he loved his home  club. <br><br>We&#39;ll miss him and we wish him the best.<b><br><br></b>In  2019, TheRangers drew Legia Warsaw in the Europa League qualifiers.  TheRangers won at home 1-0 but the Legia fans had a field day as just  recently TheRangers had a part stadium closure due to racist chanting  (anti-Catholic &amp; anti-Irish), with the Legia fans displaying a  massive Pope John Paul II tifo to wind them up at Ibrox. Boruc was in  amongst them and made everyone smile.<br><br>[....]<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows

Something must be done about his actions.&quot;   <br><b>Rangers  Supporters Trust (Apr 08), shows that Boruc must be doing something  right to rile those muppets up, not that it takes much to do so.</b><br><br>&quot;The  best opinions come, of course, from Artur Boruc. When asked about  Scottish journalists who call him a clown he answers that he doesn&rsquo;t  give a shampoo. He accuses Scottish media of being pro-Rangers and  claims that if it was Celtic which lost the Uefa Cup final there would  be no excuses for the team&rsquo;s poor performance (apparently the Scottish  media try to justify Rangers&rsquo; horrible output in the final). &quot;<br><b>Boruc on the Scottish Media, June 08 </b><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/index.php?s=6279e13fe71642f2bfecf45fd5e09ada&showtopic=68795" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><b>(Source</b></a><b>)</b><br><br>&quot;There  was lots of talk about me leaving in the summer but I&#39;m still here and  I&#39;m happy with that. It is not a problem for me to stay here and that&#39;s  what people have to understand. There was no point in me changing club  for a team that was a similar size to Celtic but one which does not  always make the Champions League or have 60,000 fans behind you.<br>&quot;To  me there is no point when I have all that at Celtic. I&#39;m really happy in  my football and in my life right now. I&#39;ve a new child and things are  settled with my football and that&#39;s good. The aim for this season is  simple. Win the title again for the fourth season and then do better in  the Champions League.<br>&quot;Of course it&#39;s great that the fans like me. But a hero? Listen, I&#39;m just a goalie, nothing more.&quot;<br><b>Boruc (Aug 08)</b><br><br>After  the game, Boruc, nicknamed the &#39;Holy Goalie&#39; by the Celtic fans, took  his goalkeeping shirt off to show a t-shirt with a picture of the Pope  and accompanying slogan.<br>But Strachan joked: &quot;He&#39;s not a bad lad, to be fair (the Pope). If it was &#39;God bless Myra Hindley&#39;, I might have a problem.&quot;<br><b>Celtic manager Gordon Strachan after 3-2 win v Rangers on Artur Boruc and his t-shirt (Apr 08)<br></b><br>&quot;Whatever  I say, I feel like I&#39;m the Commandant in the Great Escape and you&#39;re  Steve McQueen. You&#39;re always trying to escape, but I always try to bring  you back!&quot;<br><b>Celtic manager Gordon Strachan jokingly on trying to  control the character that is Artur Boruc (Radio Clyde One interview,  Dec 08)</b> <br><br><i>Interviewer: </i>&quot;Is he the best goalkeeper you&#39;ve worked with?&quot;<br><i>WGS</i>: &quot;I&#39;ve played with some good ones who are my friends, but I&#39;d say yeah!&quot; <br><b><font face="Helvetica">Celtic manager Gordon Strachan prai</font>ses Boruc (Radio Clyde One interview, (Dec 08)</b> <br><br>&quot;I feel proud to have represented Celtic for so many years,&quot; Boruc told www.celticfc.net. <br>&quot;Some people don&#39;t realise just how big a club it is and how much it means to people. <br>&quot;Joining Celtic has had a massive impact on my own life as well. It has changed my life in so many ways. <br>&quot;A lot has happened in the last years and I will always have a strong connection with the club. <br>&quot;Celtic is now a part of me. I look upon myself as a Celtic supporter. <br>&quot;Before I signed, I thought Legia was the only club in the world for me, but coming to Celtic has changed all that. <br>&quot;The people who know me back home in Poland can&#39;t believe the way I feel about Celtic. <br>&quot;It&#39;s even had an impact on all of my friends - they look for the Celtic score every week. <br>&quot;Celtic mean a lot to me and I look forward to coming back to watch the team when I am an old man. <br>&quot;I will travel to an away game, have a few drinks with the fans and then cheer on the team in the stands. <br>&quot;I would love that. It would be really nice.&quot;<b><br>Artur Boruc on www.celticfc.net. </b><b> (Dec 09)</b><br><br>&quot;Being a goalkeeper is like being the guy in the military who makes the bombs - one mistake and &#39;bang&#39;, everyone gets blown up!&quot;<br><b>Artur Boruc</b><br><br>&quot;Before I signed, I thought Legia was the only club in the world for me, but coming to Celtic has changed all that.&quot; <br><b>Artur Boruc<br></b><br>&quot;Celtic mean a lot to me and I look forward to coming back to watch the team when I am an old man.&quot; <br><b>Artur Boruc <br></b><br>   &quot;He helped me and our team to win championships and get to the last 16  of European Cups.

The Celtic goalkeeper was  cautioned by police on Friday after blessing himself in an Old Firm  game at Ibrox last February. For the Polish international, a committed  Catholic, it is a chastening experience, but for the game north of the  border it is a reminder that sectarianism remains a malignant, stubborn  presence; it is Scottish football&rsquo;s form of racism. Celtic,  predominately supported by Glasgow&rsquo;s Catholics, and Rangers,  historically the city&rsquo;s Protestant club, remain bound to an intractable  religious enmity.<br><br>Several Rangers supporters complained to police  after the match, which Celtic won 1-0, accusing Boruc of crossing  himself in front of the Copland Road stand at the start of the second  half. Following a six-month investigation, the procurator fiscal issued  the caution &mdash; in effect a formal warning that is an alternative to  criminally prosecuting the player &mdash; because his behaviour &ldquo;provoked  alarm and crowd trouble&rdquo;. It seems a damning indictment of Scottish  football, and the country&#39;s society in general, that a religious gesture  can be regarded as inflammatory and insulting, although it clearly also  depends on the nature and intent of Boruc&rsquo;s actions. <br><br>&ldquo;I didn&#39;t  see the incident myself, but I was aware of a commotion behind the goal  and many fans on the supporters bus saw Boruc cross himself and were  angered by it,&rdquo; says John McMillan, of the Rangers supporters  federation. &ldquo;I find it difficult to believe that he didn&rsquo;t know what he  was doing. We have a particular situation in Scotland, particularly on  the west coast, where people are sensitive to such actions.<br> It comes  as second nature for many players in Spain or Italy and I don&rsquo;t think  we should expect them to be aware of this, nor do they do it in an  inflammatory manner. But perhaps some players in Scotland should be  reminded of what could happen.&rdquo; <br><br>It is common practice throughout  Europe for many footballers of the Catholic faith to cross themselves  as they enter the field of play, and in recent years even Rangers  players, such as Lorenzo Amoruso, the Italian defender, and Shota  Arveladze, the Georgian striker, blessed themselves at Ibrox without  rancour. At the heart of this incident is whether Boruc did more than  merely a reflexive act of blessing himself, or whether he deliberately  set out to taunt the Rangers fans behind his goal. <br><br>&ldquo;Like 96% of  Polish people, he is very Catholic, it is a Catholic country,&rdquo; said  Boruc&rsquo;s agent, Radoslaw Osuch, last night. &ldquo;He was a regular church  goer, everything you need to be a religious guy, he did in his life. He  was a little bit surprised (by the police investigation) because he told  me he didn&rsquo;t want to hurt the Rangers supporters. He normally crosses  himself on the field, like most Polish players. I know him very well and  I know he doesn&rsquo;t care about the religion of Rangers supporters. For  sure, he didn&rsquo;t make (the sign of the cross) especially.&rdquo; <br><br>Yet  only in Scotland could an act that is commonplace in a religious context  provoke such an outcry, with church leaders and politicians becoming  embroiled in a heated debate in response to the actions of a goalkeeper  in a football match. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a worrying and alarming development,  especially since the sign of the cross is globally accepted as a gesture  of religious reverence,&rdquo; said Peter Kearney, a spokesman for the  Catholic church. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also very common in international football and  was commonplace throughout the World Cup. It is extremely regrettable  that Scotland seems to have made itself one of the few countries in the  world where this simply religious gesture is considered an offence.&rdquo; <br><br>Whatever  might have been the intent of Boruc&rsquo;s actions, he has become yet  another Old Firm casualty. It is a fixture of straining wrath that  regularly causes players to lose their sense of restraint. And this is  only the latest in a long and inglorious line of Old Firm flashpoints.  In 1987, Terry Butcher and Chris Woods, of Rangers, and Frank McAvennie,  of Celtic, were charged with breach of the peace following an Old Firm  game in which the three came to blows in the penalty box, while Graham  Roberts, the Rangers defender, was charged with inciting the crowd to  riot after conducting the Rangers fans&rsquo; sectarian songs like a  choirmaster. That three England internationals can become caught up in  the fixture&rsquo;s poisonous undercurrents says much about its pernicious  influence. <br><br>Paul Gascoigne was warned by the Scottish Football  Association in 1998 after mimicking playing the flute like an Orange  Order band member at Celtic Park, although the police did not become  involved in that occasion. Mo Johnston infamously crossed himself after  being sent off for Celtic in the 1986 League Cup final against Rangers,  and when he joined the Ibrox club in 1989 from Nantes, becoming the  first high-profile Catholic player to sign for Rangers, many supporters  burned their season tickets and scarves outside the ground. <br>For a  time recently, especially with Amoruso becoming the club&rsquo;s first  Catholic captain and the religion of players such as Arveladze and Paul  Le Guen, the Frenchman who in the summer became the first Catholic to be  appointed Ibrox manager, it seemed as though sectarianism might be on  the wane. But periods of calm are often misleading. <br><br>For this is  an issue that the country as a whole struggles to come to terms with and  Jack McConnell, the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s first minister, described  sectarianism as &ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s shame&rdquo; when he embarked on a drive to tackle  the problem two years ago. Football, though, remains its most visible  form of expression and it has taken the intervention of outside bodies  to force the game to confront the issue. Uefa fined Rangers &pound;13,300 over  songs sung during the Champions League matches against Villarreal last  season, and further sanctions remain a threat if supporters continue  chants such as The Billy Boys, which contains the line &ldquo;up to our knees  in fenian blood&rdquo;. Last month, the club issued a book to supporters  providing alternative songs. <br><br>There is a moronic element of the  Old Firm support that remains ambivalent to morality and when Le Guen  attended the Hearts v Celtic game at Tynecastle earlier this month, he  was spat on by a Celtic supporter as he left the ground. Songs such as  The Boys of the Old Brigade, which celebrates the IRA, can still be  heard being sung by the Parkhead fans. In the way that racism remains a  virulent problem across European football, so sectarianism seems firmly  embedded in Scottish football and Boruc has merely become the latest  player to find himself embroiled in it. <br><br>His caution raises the  prospect of players being investigated by the police if a supporter  takes offence at an innocent gesture. And what might happen if a Spanish  team plays at Ibrox in a European match and one of their players  crosses themselves when they score? It is an issue that continues to  defy rational belief. Osuch says that Boruc who didn&rsquo;t play against  Hibernian yesterday due to injury, remains committed to Celtic. <br><br>&ldquo;He  will stay at Celtic, he is very happy there,&rdquo; Osuch added. &ldquo;I saw him  one month ago when he was in Poland and I can tell you that he really  feels like a Celtic player, It&#39;s not like another country or another  place to work now, after one year he is very close to Celtic.&rdquo; <br><br>At the moment, he might feel too close to Celtic, and the stark realities of being an Old Firm player. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><h3>Boruc seals Viola switch 			</h3><div class="ss-art-head"><h3>Goalkeeper&#39;s Celtic exit confirmed after passing medical</h3>  				 					 Last updated: 15th July 2010 (Sky Sports News) 		 		  			</div> 		   	 	  		  		 			 			  				     		 <div class="lingo_region">   	Goalkeeper Artur Boruc has completed his move to Fiorentina from  Celtic after passing a medical with the Serie A side.
