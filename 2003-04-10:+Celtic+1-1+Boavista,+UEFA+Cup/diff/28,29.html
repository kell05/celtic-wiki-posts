<h3>Match<img align="right" alt="Larsson goes from hero to villain in the 74th minute when his penalty is saved by Boavista's goalkeeper " height="245" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/jwjZjV_-Tejw2G4FOOPz5A11548/GW200H245" title="Larsson goes from hero to villain in the 74th minute when his penalty is saved by Boavista's goalkeeper " width="200"></h3>  Henrik Larsson was the saint and sinner for Celtic at Parkhead - scoring the equalising goal but missing a penalty kick. <br><br>The Portuguese side provided muscular, well-organised opposition and were given a gift of a goal when Celtic defender Joos Valgaeren put the ball into his own net. <br><br>Celtic had the lion&#39;s share of possession but lacked the midfield invention to break down Boavista and squandered the second-half chances that came their way. <br>Celtic started at a whirlwind pace and had the Portuguese side pinned back for long spells without creating any clear goal-scoring chances. <br><br>The best early opportunity fell to Larsson in the seventh minute but he was stretching to meet John Hartson&#39;s neat pass and could only poke the ball wide from 10 yards. <br><br>Belgian referee Frank De Bleeckere did nothing to endear himself to the 60,000 crowd by failing to punish Boavista for three handball incidents in the first 12 minutes, two inside the visitors&#39; penalty box. <br><br>Celtic were given a fright in the 18th minute when Pedrosa broke and crossed to Luiz Claudio, who directed the ball back into the path of Duda, but the striker&#39;s shot deflected off Bobo Balde and spun wide. <br><br>With Boavista defending deep and in numbers there was precious little space for Larsson to exploit and, with goalkeeper Ricardo commanding his area, crosses to Hartson were also proving fruitless. <br><br>The second half was just three minutes old when the noisy crowd were stunned by Valgaeren&#39;s own goal. <br><br>The Belgian defender slid across his goalkeeper Rab Douglas in a bid to block a low cross from Martelinho, but only succeeded in diverting the ball into the net with his studs. <br><br>Celtic&#39;s reply was immediate and parity was established within a minute when Larsson stroked home his 26th European goal. <br><br><br>A cross from Neil Lennon was delightfully cushioned into Larsson&#39;s path by Stilian Petrov and the Swede drilled home from eight yards. <br><br>Douglas made a good save from a Pedrosa free kick in the 58th minute and four minutes later Ricardo had to deal with a raking set-piece effort from Larsson. <br><br>Hartson was given a glimpse of goal in the Boavista penalty box but could not connect with his shot properly and the ball looped harmlessly into the arms of Ricardo. <br><br>The Welshman had a better chance when the ball landed at his feet just a few yards out in the 72nd minute, but he could only stab it straight at Ricardo. <br><br>Celtic were handed a fabulous opportunity to go in front 15 minutes from time when they were awarded a penalty for yet another hand ball. <br>However, a flying save from Ricardo denied Larsson from the spot. <br><br>Ricardo almost handed Celtic a late winner when he fumbled a cross into the path of Hartson, but Turra was on hand to clear the striker&#39;s goal-bound shot. <br><br>In injury time Hartson saw a header flash inches wide of the target. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows

1-1 draw at home to Boavista.<br><br>An own goal from Joos Valgaeren handed the visitors the lead in their semi-final first-leg tie before Henrik Larsson equalised.<br><br>Larsson later missed a penalty and Hartson spurned a number of good opportunities to put his side in front.<br><br>Boavista offered very little, but having already claimed the scalps of Malaga, Hertha Berlin and Paris St Germain on their Uefa run, Celtic know the away leg will be tough.<br><br>Match report:<br>Celtic 1-1 Boavista<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re still in this tie,&quot; man of the match Hartson told BBC TV.<br><br>&quot;We drew at home with Liverpool and we finished the job away from home so there&#39;s no reason why we can&#39;t do that again.<br><br>&quot;It will be difficult but we&#39;ve got the

stadium.<br><br>&quot;But we resolved that problem at Anfield and we can do it again, I&#39;m sure.<br><br>&quot;All I know is that we have to score over there and I think we will.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re still well in this game. There&#39;s no doubt about that.&quot;<br><br><h3>Celtic held by Boavista</h3>BBC<br>Celtic 1-1 Boavista<br><br>Celtic&#39;s bid to reach their first European final for 33 years hangs in the balance after they were held at home to Boavista in the Uefa Cup semi final first leg.<br><br>Henrik Larsson was the saint and sinner for Celtic at Parkhead - scoring the equalising goal but missing a penalty kick.<br><br>The Portuguese side provided muscular, well-organised opposition and were given a gift of a goal when Celtic defender Joos Valgaeren put the ball into his own net.<br><br>Celtic had the lion&#39;s share of possession but lacked the midfield invention to break down Boavista and squandered the second-half chances that came their way.<br><br>Celtic started at a whirlwind pace and had the Portuguese side pinned back for long spells without creating any clear goal-scoring chances.<br><br>Celtic pin hopes on away form<br><br>The best early opportunity fell to Larsson in the seventh minute but he was stretching to meet John Hartson&#39;s neat pass and could only poke the ball wide from 10 yards.<br><br>Belgian referee Frank De Bleeckere did nothing to endear himself to the 60,000 crowd by failing to punish Boavista for three handball incidents in the first 12 minutes, two inside the visitors&#39; penalty box.<br><br>Celtic were given a fright in the 18th minute when Pedrosa broke and crossed to Luiz Claudio, who directed the ball back into the path of Duda, but the striker&#39;s shot deflected off Bobo Balde and spun wide.<br><br>With Boavista defending deep and in numbers there was precious little space for Larsson to exploit and, with goalkeeper Ricardo commanding his area, crosses to Hartson were also proving fruitless.<br><br>The second half was just three minutes old when the noisy crowd were stunned by Valgaeren&#39;s own goal.<br><br>The Belgian defender slid across his goalkeeper Rab Douglas in a bid to block a low cross from Martelinho, but only succeeded in diverting the ball into the net with his studs.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s reply was immediate and parity was established within a minute when Larsson stroked home his 26th European goal.<br><br>Larsson saw his penalty kick saved by Ricardo<br><br>A cross from Neil Lennon was delightfully cushioned into Larsson&#39;s path by Stilian Petrov and the Swede drilled home from eight yards.<br><br>Douglas made a good save from a Pedrosa free kick in the 58th minute and four minutes later Ricardo had to deal with a raking set-piece effort from Larsson.<br><br>Hartson was given a glimpse of goal in the Boavista penalty box but could not connect with his shot properly and the ball looped harmlessly into the arms of Ricardo.<br><br>The Welshman had a better chance when the ball landed at his feet just a few yards out in the 72nd minute, but he could only stab it straight at Ricardo.<br><br>Celtic were handed a fabulous opportunity to go in front 15 minutes from time when they were awarded a penalty for yet another hand ball.<br><br>However, a flying save from Ricardo denied Larsson from the spot.<br><br>Ricardo almost handed Celtic a late winner when he fumbled a cross into the path of Hartson, but Turra was on hand to clear the striker&#39;s goal-bound shot.<br><br>In injury time Hartson saw a header flash inches wide of the target.<br><br>Celtic: Douglas, Mjallby, Balde, Valgaeren, Agathe, Lambert, Lennon, Petrov, Thompson, Larsson, Hartson.

Celtic are in their traidtional green and white hoops, while Boavista sport a yellow kit. (Anunciacao wears No96, for some reason). Celtic go into their pre-match huddle: &quot;Come on chaps! Let&#39;s smite our swarthy visitors, eh?&quot; and kick off playing from right to left in Celtic Park. Unless you&#39;re looking from the other side, in which case it&#39;s left to right.<br><br>2 mins: Hartson wins the first free kick of the match for backing into Avalos. It&#39;s about 10 yards outside the Boavista box, slightly to the left. Larsson shoots straight into the wall.<br><br>3 mins: Hartson wins another free after an aeriel collision involving himself, Anunciacao and Avalos. The No96 goes off to get treatment on a cut under his eye. Given how difficult it is to type his name, I&#39;m hoping he doesn&#39;t come back.<br><br>4 mins: Mjallby concedes a throw-in just down by the corner flag. Boavista take a long throw-in to the Celtic box, which Lennon heads clear. Mjallby&#39;s hair is looking great, if anyone&#39;s interested. Shiny, blonde and swept back in it&#39;s usual Thor God Of Aloe Vera fashion.<br><br>7 mins: The first good chance of the game goes begging. Hartson chested down a long ball and threaded a neat pass into the box for Larsson. Ricardo sprinted out of the Boavista goal, but the Swede was unable to lift it over him as he and the ball were both running away from the goal and the angle was just too narrow.<br><br>8 mins: Anunciacao (yes, he&#39;s back) slips under pressure in the box and handles the ball. The stadium erupts with a penalty appeal. The ref judges it to have been accidental.<br><br>9 mins: &quot;&#39;E-mail Barry with your comments and offers,&#39; it says up there. Exactly what sort of offers are you expecting?&quot; enquires William de Quetteville. I dunno Will, I didn&#39;t write it. But seeing as you ask - money, sex, stuff made from ermine, a nice cup of tea, precious things ... I&#39;m not that fussy. Celtic Park appeals for another penalty (handball again). This one is slightly less convincing. Claudio has a pop from distance for Boavista but slices the ball horribly wide. If he&#39;d curled it the other way it would have been the greatest goal of all time.<br><br>15 mins: The match is still being played at a fair old pelt and hasn&#39;t really settled down. Celtic are definitely having the better of the early exchanges, although if Iraqi information minister Mohammed Al-Sahaf was doing this commentary, he&#39;d probably tell you that Boavista were hammering the Scottish infidels 16-0, with an even bigger hiding to come in the second leg. Boavista win a corner after Duda takes the ball wide of Agathe, shoots and brings a smartish save out of Douglas.<br><br>18 mins: As Boavista play their offside trap, Eder slips. Nevertheless, he&#39;d moved far enough to ensure that John Hartson was flagged as he tried to latch on to a Larsson through ball.<br><br>20 mins: Petrov shoots low and hard from about 15 feet outside the Boavista box. Wide as a ditch.<br><br>21 mins: Celtic win a corner through Didier Agathe. It&#39;s swung in to the far post but is a fraction too high for John Hartson to nod down. Celtic win a free-kick for handball on the left wing, parallel with the penalty spot (if you know what I mean). One poor Alan Thompson cross later and Ricardo gathers comfortably.<br><br>24 mins: Anunciacao shoots. His long range attempt goes wide. Not a bad effort all the same.<br><br>25 mins: The Celtic fans strike up a chorus of &quot;Walking In A Celtic Wonderland&quot;, one verse of which (as I recall from a Glaswegian pal of mine murdering it on a regular basis while drunk) goes: &quot;There&#39;s only one Bobby Petta/ He was sh*te, now he&#39;s better/ We brought him to mass and now he&#39;s got class/Walking in a Celtic wonderland.&quot; It&#39;s true what they say, the Lord does move in mysterious ways. Larsson attempts a low cross/shot from a narrow angle but his effort is deflected into Ricardo&#39;s arms.<br><br>29 mins: Boavista win a free-kick just inside the Celtic half. In the time it takes me to type that sentence, Celtic have cleared through Mjallby and Agathe tries to get on the end of a Mjallby hoof. Ricardo beats him to the ball. Valgaeren goes off to get a cut hand bandaged. Which begs the question: How the devil do you cut your hand playing football?<br><br>32 mins: Celtic are bossing the game with most of the possession and attacking, but they haven&#39;t looked like scoring yet. Boavista&#39;s devious scheme to close them down and mark with all the tightness of a rubber gimp costume is working well.<br><br>35 mins: Moor poor Celtic crossing, leaving John Hartson frustrated in the Boavista box. Ricardo, on the other hand, is delighted. He&#39;ll be able to catch those all night, although he has flapped at a couple so far.<br><br>37 mins: Celtic win a free-kick at least 35 yards out, straight in front of the Boavista goal. Thompson kicks it straight into the wall. A waste.<br><br>41 mins: Boavista go on a rare sortie into Celtic&#39;s half but concede a free. While the match hasn&#39;t been as excruciating as most, say, Liverpool games I&#39;ve seen this season, it certainly ain&#39;t pretty. Speaking of which: &quot;How long before Big Emile&#39;s hapless ball control get&#39;s a mention? It&#39;s always been the highlight of your commentaries and it seems a shame to leave him out at this stage of the competition,&quot; enquires Ian Edgar, who appears to have forgotten that Big Emile plays for Liverpool, who were eliminated in the last round. If it&#39;s gratuitous snipes at Mr Em&#39;s lack of finesse you&#39;re after, Ian, you&#39;ve come to the wrong place.<br><br>43 mins: Celtic win a free-kick on the right wing which Alan Thompson plays into the near post. After a spot of head-tennis, somebody - I think Mjallby - loops a header over the bar and on to the netting. &quot;Just want to complement you on your accurate and totally unbiased account of Scumchester Utd taking their fully deserved whipping the other night,&quot; writes Niall Mulligan, who I&#39;m guessing isn&#39;t a season ticket holder at Old Trafford. That&#39;s certainly nicer than the mail I got accusing me of being a &quot;Scouse bin-licker.&quot; And that was some of the more positive feedback I received.<br><br>Another nice polite e-mail to see us through half-time: Baz, you have a slight typo in the preamble. In the first paragraph, the letter &#39;e&#39; is missing from the word &#39;welcome&#39;. Willy.&quot; Tnhks Wlly. I thnik you&#39;ll ifnd thres prbabyl laods of typsos in this rport. However, at the risk of sounding pedantic, I&#39;d have to argue that there&#39;s no such thing as a &#39;slight typo&#39;. It&#39;s either a typo or it isn&#39;t. &quot;Barry, the minute-by-minute match logo is so boring. What happened to the beer cans? I think a new logo should show someone banging their head against the screen after the obligatory system crash,&quot; writes Tracy Mohr. I&#39;m sorry Tracy, but it&#39;s nowt to do with me. If I had my way the minute-by-minute logo would feature me at home drinking beer and playing G1 Jockey on the PlayStation, while somebody else sweated out of every orifice in their body to get here for 7pm to cover a match they thought started at 8pm.<br><br>45 mins: Boavista kick off, attack and Erivan strikes a left-foot effort high over the bar.<br><br>46 mins: Hartson does brilliantly to hold off Avalos, chest down a high ball and cross to Bobo Balde at the far post. He heads it back into the box and Anunciacao clears.<br><br>48 mins: GOAL!!! Celtic 0 - 1 Boavista A disaster for Celtic. Anunciacao crosses from the right and under pressure from Duda, Valgaeren slices an attempted clearance the ball into his own net at the near post.<br><br>49 minutes: GOAL!!! Celtic 1 - 1 Boavista Not such a disaster for Celtic, although I&#39;m not entirely sure what happened. Hold on, here we go: A cross into the Boavista box from Lennon was controlled by Petrov and laid off to Larsson, who buried it past Ricardo from the edge of the six-yard box into the &#39;keeper&#39;s bottom right-hand corner.<br><br>52 mins: A spot of handbags after Boavista win a free-out. Balde jumped to contest a high ball with Ricardo and caught the Portuguese goalkeeper with his arm. Hartson got involved, then Anunciacao threw in his two cents. The referee sorts it out and Boavista take their free-kick.<br><br>54 mins: Amid all the excitement, William Loughran, typo-spotter extraordinaire, has mailed in again to say that the there&#39;s nothing wrong with the expression &#39;slight typo&#39;. &quot;It&#39;s the same difference as making a slight mistake and a big one,&quot; he says. Like paying &pound;11 million for Emile Heskey is a big mistake, while paying &pound;400,000 for Djimi Traore is a slight mistake, I suppose. Boavista win a free-kick just outside the Celtic box. Neil Lennon is the guilty man. He gets booked after tracking back to make an imperative tackle on Duda, but catches the striker&#39;s heel instead.<br><br>57 mins: Duda hobbles off the pitch for treatment, aided by two middle-aged bald men who look eerily similar. Perhaps they&#39;re twins. Pedrosa takes the free-kick, shoots it past the wall and forces a good save out of Rab Douglas, who dives low and to his left.<br><br>59 mins: The crowd appeal for another penalty after Avalos and Hartson go down in an ungainly heap (let&#39;s face it, heaps by their very nature are ungainly, and the presence of John hartson iin one is certainly not going to make it more aesthetically pleasing) in the Boavista box. The referee is having none of it. Avalos has already been booked by the way, having been carded for a foul on Lennon around the time of the two-minute goal festival.<br><br>63 mins: Wahey! My computer starts giving me some long overdue gyp. While I was waiting four minutes for it to save those four lines, Larsson shot low and hard from distance, making Ricardo dive low and to his left to prevent a goal. Neil Lennon is taking woeful abuse from the Celtic crowd whenever he gets the ball. I have no idea why. Perhaps it&#39;s because he&#39;s got a bad does of David Batty Syndrome and keeps passing it backwards.<br><br>66 mins: I&#39;ve been so busy swearing at my PC and slapping the monitor (because that really helps solve technical problems and decaching issues), I forgot to mention that Marteklinho and Turra have both been booked for Boavista. The latter, who is wearing a very elaborate mask to protect a broken nose, will miss the return leg. As we already know, Boavista have a valuable away goal to take back to Portugal with them. However, I feel the need to tell you anyway, because that&#39;s what commentator&#39;s do.<br><br>70 mins: &quot;What is Boavista&#39;s home record this season and in Cup games? How big is the stadium? How do their supporters compare? When is the second leg match?&quot; enquires Tony Bryda, who appears to be labouring the illusion that I am either (a) John Motson or (b) a Portuguese Rothmans Yearbook. I&#39;d answer all those questions for you Tony, but I think it&#39;d be better for you if you looked them up yourself. (ie I haven&#39;t the foggiest). Hartson shoots from point-blank range and a tight angle. Ricardo parries involuntarily.<br><br>74 mins: Celtic win a penalty for handball, after a Thompson free-kick takes a wicked deflection. Larsson places the ball on the spot and takes a few steps back and ...<br><br>75 mins: ... Ricardo dives to his right and saves. Larsson holds his head in his hands. (His own head, not Ricardo&#39;s.) My apologies for the current excruciating delays in transmission. Unfortunately there&#39;s nothing I can do about it. Technical issues.<br><br>77 mins: Celtic substitutions: Huggy Bear lookalike (it&#39;s uncanny) Momo Sylla replaces Agathe. (pre-penalty) and Fernandez for Petrov. Celtic are really making this tie difficult for themselves. Not only have they conceded an away goal, now they&#39;re squandering chances handed to them on a silver platter. That&#39;s so unlike Scottish teams in Europe.<br><br>79 mins: Cafu, a second-half substitute for Boavista that I wasn&#39;t aware of goes off. He&#39;s replaced by Bosingwa. &quot;Excuse my ignorance, what exactly is meant by a &#39;handbag&#39;?&quot;enquires Luis Correia, a Boavista fan in Toronto. It&#39;s slang for a feeble attempt at a fight, Luis. Imagine two ladies slapping each other repeatedly with their handbags.<br><br>83 mins: Celtic win a free-kick five or six yards outside the Boavista box. For some inexplicable reason, they let Thompson take it again. As per the script, he shoots it straight into the wall.<br><br>84 mins: Ricardo fumbles a Sylla cross, which drops at Hartson&#39;s feet. Without much backswing (not a criticism, he hasn&#39;t time), he threads it through the onrushing goalkeeper&#39;s legs but Turra hacks it clear off the line. Good effort from Hartson. Unlucky.<br><br>86 mins: Thompson crosses from the left, but Eder intercepts and boots it out for a throw-in.<br><br>87 mins: Sylla and Pedrosa go for a 50-50 ball and the Boavista man ends up in a crumpled heap on the ground, holding his knee. He gets stretchered off. Celtic win a corner.<br><br>89 mins: The corner is swung in, Ricardo drops it and Bobo Balde is penalised for standing nearby.<br><br>91 mins: &quot;Why do you bother calling this stuff &#39;minute-by-minute&#39; when it isn&#39;t?&quot; enquires D. Hatter in the most mealy-mouthed email it&#39;s ever been my displeasure to receive. We call this &quot;stuff&quot; a minute-by-minute to give nit-picky goons like you something else to complain about, Mr Hatter (I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re an anorak-wearing, bespectacled, greasy-haired bloke). From a corner, John Hartson sends a bullet-header wide of the far post. he should have scored.<br><br>Full time The match finishes all square, but Boavista have the advantage as they take an away goal home with them.<br><br>Another mail from D Hatter: &quot;That&#39;s it, I&#39;m off to the Sporting Life website,&quot; he harrumphs, zipping up his anorak and slamming the door with what little strangth he can muster on his way out. Conspiratorial whisper: Now that he&#39;s gone, I can tell the rest of you that the sad thing is, he&#39;s probably reading this minute-by-minute report in the bedroom he sleeps alone in every single night while simultaneously watching the match on television. I&#39;ve had grumbles from his type before - you get to recognise them after a while. Anyway, that&#39;s all from me tonight.
