The support had been concerned about the goalkeeping position, and de Vries was in a good position to earn some possible first team action in major matches in the twilight of his career. <br><br>He wasn&#39;t new to Scottish football, as he previously played for Dunfermline in 2006/07 before moving to Swansea becoming a success under Brendan Rodgers (then the Swansea manager) who was now the Celtic manager. <br><br>Brendan Rodgers had actually wanted to sign him for Liverpool but to no avail, but he had his man now. Rodgers even stated that losing de Vries with Suarez were his biggest transfer disappointments as a manager (and Suarez was to be a world class striker in a star-laden Barcelona side). Despite his age, he was voted Player of the Year by the Forest fans in his last season prior to arrival at Celtic, so appeared to be a bargain signing.<br><br><div></div><div>He was to have a tough start and was thrown in the deep end but came out well after playing in a 4-1 victory over Aberdeen and then the inaugural league match v TheRangers which Celtic won easily 5-1 (and he was to have an easy afternoon). Sadly he was the one in goals v Barcelona in September 2016 which saw the mighty front threesome of Neymar, Messia &amp; Suarez tear Celtic apart 7-0. He was at a hiding to nothing, and shouldn&#39;t be faulted, and this match for all best just filed away.<br> <br> Despite that, he was having a difficult time adjusting, having been thrown in without any pre-season at Celtic or warm-up games to get settled in.<br> <br> The real low point for De Vries came after the Kilmarnock goal in a 6-1 win in Sep 2016. He was subbed off at half-time for Gordon after conceding an admittedly fine long range shot, but excuses had now ran out for some. Rare for a goalkeeper substitution. Officially De Vries got an injury, the rest of us were unconvinced. <br> <br> De Vries overall had had a poor start at Celtic with no clean sheets, so a fired-up Craig Gordon was brought back in as a starter and played a great game in a 3-3 draw with the monied up Man City.<br> <br> From there on in, Gordon was once again the first choice with few questions asked and actually returned to good form. Even following concern that Gordon was to leave prematurely to Chelsea in January 2017 (which he didn&#39;t), thoughts were on finding someone else, which seemed harsh on De Vries. Gordon remained and was in general excellent domestically as Celtic romped to the domestic treble (the InVIncibles).<br> <br> De Vries was to be seen as one of the few poor transfer moves in the first season, but on the other hand he wasn&#39;t really expected to be a long-term answer. Given further opportunities if they arose, he may likely have proven himself and he was a touch unfortunate with the set of games he had to perform in without being given time to bed in.<br> <br> If anything, De Vries&#39; greatest value was to give Craig Gordon a shock to the system, and return back to form. It worked.<br> <br> In Oct 2017, he filled in for Craig Gordon in the league in a 1-0 victory over Dundee, and finally was given overdue respect by the support after a great performance with some fine saves. He had shown his worth and skill, and Rodgers could now highlight why he had brought in De Vries. Other matches didn&#39;t fill everyone with confidence but as a cost effective backup you couldn&#39;t complain. Scott Bain was brought in as further cover in case of further injuries but De Vries got on with his role, very professionally.<br> <br> Too many had already made their minds up about him, and that included it seems the backroom staff. Once Scott Bain was brought in, the writing was on the wall. <br> <br> De Vries may not have set the heather on fire but he was really an honest professional. He worked hard, and did have some fine performances along the way, sadly not in any key matches. He actually was unlucky as after a run in the first team he got injured in training just prior to a league match v TheRangers, which Celtic were to win 3-2 in a cracking win. Scott Bain replaced him, and if De Vries had played in that game it could have given him a perfect platform in that last season to make a name for himself in a major Celtic match after some of the prior debacles.<br><br>From hereon in, it was Scott Bain who was now the reserve keeper at Celtic, and into 2018/19 following some fine form, De Vries was surplus to requirements. De Vries never played in a single game for the first team in season 2018/19.<br><br>Despite his position in the squad over the wonderful treble winning seasons, sadly for him he never got to formally complete the medal set as he never played in a league cup match over the period. Still he was to leave with a fabulous experience at Celtic, little offered to many at his late stage in his career.<br><br>With his main sponsor, Brendan Rodgers, having left Celtic prematurely, it was inevitable that Dorus De Vries would not be rolled on into the next season, and announced his retirement for his playing career on his departure in July 2019.<br><br>He never made any public complaints, and was professional whenever he was awarded a place in the team or squad, which we can respect.<br><br>We wish him the best.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>Quotes</h3>&quot;We are a young team but a lot of the young guys here play like men and  there is only room to grow and get better.

possible compliment when he said losing him and Luis Suarez were his biggest transfer disappointments as a boss.<br><br>The Hoops gaffer is thrilled to be reunited with the Dutchman after buying him from Nottingham Forest for a modest six-figure sum on a two-year contract.<br><br>And the way Rodgers spoke about de Vries last night in the aftermath of a 2-0 defeat to Inter Milan in Limerick in the International Champions Cup sounded ominous for current Celts No1 Craig Gordon.<br><br>Make no mistake the veteran 35-year-old &mdash; recovering from a minor ankle knock but not yet ruled out of the midweek Champions League play-off first leg against Hapoel Be&rsquo;er Sheva &mdash; is a serious threat to the Scotland star.<br><br>Rodgers said: &ldquo;For me I need to have, and how we work, a goalkeeper that means when we have possession we have 11 players &mdash; that he can distribute the ball and pass it. Dorus is as good as I&rsquo;ve seen in that in all my travels.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been really, really disappointed twice in my career when I&rsquo;ve lost players &mdash; one was Luis Suarez at Liverpool and the first one was Dorus de Vries at Swansea.<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because he was such a key part of how I worked there.<br><br>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a real fit guy, he&rsquo;s 35 but look at guys like Van der Saar who played right through till 40 and has some of his best years in that final part of their career.<br><br>&ldquo;Dorus I know well enough to know he looks after his body and will come in and get how I work.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been nursing a slight knock so we&rsquo;re just assessing that. He&rsquo;s with the medical team and I expect him to join the goalkeepers tomorrow and see his availability from then.&rdquo;<br><br>Rodgers was thrilled with the performances from his fringe players against Inter including several academy graduates.<br><br>He added: &ldquo;I was really pleased with the way we played against a top side with real good quality.&rdquo;<br><br>Rodgers revealed Nir Bitton is back in contention to face Hapoel from injury and he said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready for it. We know how important it is &mdash; but we know about the opposition, how tough it will be.&rdquo;<br><br>Meanwhile, new Inter Milan boss and ex-Rangers star Frank de Boer said: &ldquo;Celtic have some good youngsters and a fantastic academy. They played quite well, especially in the second half when we were more tired.<br><br>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s good for the league that Rangers are back and the mentality is back that they should be number one in the league. I would be happy to see that happen of course.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Dorus de Vries still scarred by Celtic&#39;s Nou Camp battering<br></h3>http://www.irishnews.com/sport/footballsoccer/2018/02/07/news/dorus-de-vries-still-scarred-by-celtic-s-nou-camp-battering-1250870/<br><br>Celtic goalkeeper Dorus De Vries looks like getting a run of games due to Craig Gordon&#39;s injury<br>By Ronnie Esplin, Press Association Sport<br>07 February, 2018 01:00<br><br>CELTIC goalkeeper Dorus de Vries admits the scars from his 7-0 Barcelona battering have yet to &quot;heal up&quot;.<br><br>The Dutchman&#39;s first game in Europe for the Hoops after signing from Nottingham Forest was a Champions League fixture at the Nou Camp in September, 2016.<br><br>A star-studded Barca side inflicted on the Scottish champions their heaviest-ever European defeat with Lionel Messi helping himself to a hat-trick, Luis Suarez a double and goals from Neymar and Andres Iniesta.<br><br>Craig Gordon took over as number one a couple of weeks later but De Vries came back into the side last month after the Scotland keeper sustained a long-term knee injury which will keep him out for up to 12 weeks.<br><br>The 37-year-old is set to make only his second appearance for Celtic in Europe on Thursday week when Russian side Zenit St Peterburg travel to Glasgow for the first leg of their Europa League clash.<br><br>Speaking at the club&#39;s Lennoxtown training complex, where he was helping publicise a new two-year sponsorship by IT and communications group company Exsel Group of the Celtic Women&#39;s team, De Vries recalled the painful night in Spain.<br><br>&quot;I think that will take a couple of years to heal up, that one, because I am a winner, I want to win,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;My daily routine is to make sure I perform every single day.<br><br>&quot;That&#39;s how I approach my job and it is still the sorest point in terms of I hate losing, I can&#39;t stand it.<br><br>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter whether it is Barcelona or Partick Thistle, you want to win. Simple.<br><br>&quot;It was a disappointing night in terms of the result, of course. It was really hard to take on board that you conceded goals, even if you concede one it is always hard to take as a goalkeeper because you don&#39;t want to concede any goals.<br><br>&quot;That (Barca) team on the night were out there as one of the best teams in the world, if not the best team in the world that night and everything just went for them.<br><br>&quot;Everything dropped right for them in front of goal, they were a different class and that&#39;s what happens sometimes.&quot;The former ADO Den Haag, Dunfermline and Wolves stopper, who worked under Hoops boss Brendan Rodgers at Swansea, thought about moving from Celtic to get first-team <span class="diffRemove">football.&quot;You</span><span class="diffAdd">football.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;You</span> are always thinking about possibilities because for players, playing is the most important thing,&quot; he <span class="diffRemove">said.&quot;That</span><span class="diffAdd">said.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;That</span> counts for me as a goalkeeper as <span class="diffRemove">well.&quot;Saying</span><span class="diffAdd">well.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Saying</span> that, I am really happy here.

I need to earn this jersey. It&#39;s as simple as that. I need to train really hard then it is up to the manager&#39;s decision.&quot;<br><br>Asked if he felt he was better than the Hoops&#39; current number one, he replied: &quot;That&#39;s a tough question but you know what, you have to have self-belief, because there is a lot of responsibility when you stand between those sticks.<br><br>&quot;Craig has it and so do I. It will be an interesting battle and it&#39;s something I&#39;m looking forward to.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve played against Craig when I was with Dunfermline and he was at Hearts. I&#39;ve got great respect for him in terms of what happened to him with his injuries. He fought to get fit and has done really well in the past years.&quot;<br><br>Rodgers tries to sign him for Liverpool but at the time Wolves refused to sell the player under any circumstances.<br><br>&quot;That was a difficult period when the Liverpool move broke down,&quot; said De Vries. &quot;When I received the call from the gaffer telling me he wanted to take me to Anfield, I was open to it.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a lovely club and the chance to work with him again would have been great. But at the time Wolves were just stubborn. They were reluctant to sell me for a fair fee.<br><br>&quot;Because of the relationship I had with the gaffer they asked a pretty high amount and the deal collapsed.&quot;<br><br>Celtic supporters may not know much about De Vries but Kenny Burns, the former Scotland player and Nottingham Forest icon, could not believe his old club allowed such a talented keeper to leave.<br><br>&quot;Dorus is a good goalkeeper and he was a big player for us last season,&quot; said Burns. &quot;You can&#39;t blame the lad for wanting to go to Celtic and having the chance to play in Europe. But the club saying a firm, &#39;no, he&#39;s unavailable&#39;, would have put an end to it.<br><br>&quot;I doubt we&#39;ll have got a lot of money for him and he probably wasn&#39;t on big wages either, so why sell him? Why would you want to let your Player of the Season go? Why are we selling someone of his quality?&quot;<br><br>De Vries is injured and so is unavailable for Wednesday&#39;s Champions League qualifier with Hapel Be&#39;er Shova but he is keen to play his part on the European stage.<br><br>He said: &quot;There is a lot to play for. When you are involved in a club like this it&#39;s great to be able to compete with the best in Europe.<br><br>&quot;But my first goal is just to get fit. Hopefully I will be training on Thursday and take it from there.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ll watch Wednesday&#39;s game from the stands though and embrace the whole sensation of what it&#39;s all about.&quot;<br><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><h3><br></h3><div><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><h3><br></h3></div><br></div>
