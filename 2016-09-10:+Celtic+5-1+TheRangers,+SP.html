I thought it was an outstanding performance.&quot;<br>&ldquo;Today was everything I expected and more.  The supporters were incredible&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;I spoke about Jock Stein in my team talk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There were two today. My father is five years dead today so it was ironic we scored five goals. And obviously Jock Stein was 31 years today. One of his quotes talks about how football is only ever about getting the two points. Back then that&rsquo;s what you got for winning.<div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div><div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync"></div>&ldquo;But when I spoke to the players before the game I said &lsquo;for us it&rsquo;s about getting the three points&rsquo;. But when you beat one of your rivals it&rsquo;s a wee bit sweeter, and that was the message. But it was primarily about the guy looking down, the man who set the tone for this club, the template. We said that if he is looking down make sure we do him proud.&rdquo;<br><br>Scott Brown: <br>&quot;It was men against boys&quot;<br><h3><font color="#333333"><br></font></h3>(joebloggscity of TheCelticWiki)<img align="right" alt="[Untitled]" height="361" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/3ecc0e53983d235eb6ee4a30083a2c21/GW370H361" title="[Untitled]" width="370"><br>So can you believe it? Actually we can, there were few, if any, Celtic fans who thought we&#39;d not win. Yet the performance and scoreline were more than could have been hoped for. Our first encounter with the new Huns in the League, and a comprehensive win. <br><br>No Leigh Griffiths was a concern but up stepped Dembele who scored a wonderful hat trick that has given the manager a possible headache for the striker role for Tuesday. <br><br>Rogic was excellent but was hacked to pieces and subbed off for Armstrong who capped off a great match himself with a goal in injury time. Brown bossed the midfield well but Bitton was a mix. Lustig capped a fine performance with setting up a goal. <br><br>The referee was poor and gave the Huns way too much leniency that was not given to Celtic. Frustrating. <br><br>Sevco big signing Joey Barton was a laughable embarrassment; before the game he said: &quot;[Scott Brown] He ain&#39;t in my league he&#39;s nowhere near the level I am as a player he  can&#39;t get to me. If I play well Scott Brown doesn&#39;t stand a chance&quot;. It was the other way around, and we all laughed esp as Barton almost scored an own goal. His own press is what gave him the overblown attention.<br><br>Hun debutant Senderos was sent off, and they really offered little but a nervous attack. Still they scored one which means the Celtic defence will continue to be asked questions. <br><br>Overall a great afternoon for Celtic and the fans, a joy to see the Zombie Huns slither away as the match was coming to a close. <br><br>(Owenbhoy of KDS)<br>Very decent performance without being outstanding.<br>And other than 10 mins in the second half where they passed it better than us, we pretty much controlled the game.<br>Sloppy goal to lose.<br><br>Thought Dembele was outstanding the whole game.<br>Held it up, passed well, set up one and scored a perfect hattrick. <br>Big Kolo other than their goal strolled the game.<br>And our keeper had pretty much nothing to do all game.<br><br>Satisfying performance considering just after an international break, with players having been flying all over the world.<br>And out right the wrongs of the semi final last year too.<br><br>Funny hearing Warburton going on about a yellow carded player fouling and not getting a red.<br>Considering Krankjar in the first half fouled 7 times, 3 of them pretty cynically too.<br><br>Didn&#39;t think Brown bossed Barton either, in fact they were hardly against each other, apart from the drop ball.<br>Wish Brown had been more mature in his interview too.<br>Let the fans do the gloating and trolling.<br><br>Didn&#39;t hear their fans on tv much either.<br>And their wrecking of the toilets sums them up.<br>Especially as their cash strapped club has to pay for it too.<br>Still, at least it could be passed as Senderos&#39;s weekly wage.<br><br>Their wee player Windass looked their best player.<br><br>Well done Brendan and the bhoys.<br>Turned out an easy 3 points. 						 						 						 					<br><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="2016-09-10: Celtic 5-1 TheRangers, SP - The Celtic Wiki" height="243" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/ab6b9e019927748aee8a422789245468/GW720H243" title="2016-09-10: Celtic 5-1 TheRangers, SP - The Celtic Wiki" width="720"><br><br>(Corky B of KDS)<br>Before the game, I thought if we get ahead we could really steam-roller  them.  But often they don&#39;t work out that way.  Well today it DID<br><br>First  15 minutes pretty even, then for the rest of the half we dominated.   Should have been more than 2-1 up at half time and a silly goal to lose.   Bit stodgy at the start of the 2nd but a great substitution meant that  the rest of the game was played in their half.  Deserved result.   Wonderful feeling.  We absolutely hammered them.  <br><br>De Vries - 6 - No chance at the goal - had nothing else to do<br>Lustig  - 7 Not brilliant at their goal but otherwise excellent.  Really great  cross for the fourth and the bit with the beach ball - superb<br>Toure - 6 - Did what he was paid to do<br>Sviatchenko - 6 - see above<br>Tierney - 6 - thought he let the cross in for their goal too easily but part from that fine<br>Forrest - 7 - gave Wallace a roasting<br>Brown - 7 - Leagues ahead of Barton<br>Biton - 7 - excellent 2nd half<br>Sinclair - 6 - Great goal but actually expected more<br>Rogic - 6 - Good first half but correctly subbed<br>Dembele - 9 - After his first goal absolutely terrorised him.  Only Bellamy at Tannadice has scored a better quality hat-trick<br>Armstrong -6 - Pleased for him after so much stick.

Watched the game in the Merchant City but commitments  meant I couldn&#39;t drink as I had to drive.  On the way home went past the  Quayside Bar with a load of guys standing outside wearing Orange  T-shirts with BJK printed on them.  If ever a bunch of folk deserved  such a result, it was them. <br><br>(Fatboab of KDS on the following controvery of the Huns&#39; statements)<br>this stuff should never have made headline news . In the long history of games between Celtic and whichever club has played out of Govan, there have been thousands of incidences of unacceptable, sectarian behaviour from both sides. What is different now?<br>The answer, unfortunately, lies in the half wits that pollute the Sevco Boardroom and their allies in the MSM. Celtic always had an unspoken understanding with the Board of the dead club, even through the days of Minty&#39;s grandstanding. It was accepted that we dealt with this stuff internally. This all ended with the death of R*****s.<br>The current incumbents of the Ibrox boardroom are classless to a man. Indeed , was it not reputed to be their scandalous behaviour at last years semi-final that stirred Desmond into action?<br>Add in the Level 5 influence over the Scottish press , and we have mountains being made out of molehills to suit the agenda. No-one is suggesting that a couple of displays from Celtic supporters weren&#39;t distasteful. They were. But was that seriously worth all this stuff? Really?<br>There&#39;s a great big elephant in the room every time we speak of Sevco. The fact they have no money, no credit, no chance of raising money now that the promises of the South African criminal have been shown to be as watertight as Sevco&#39;s lamentable central defence. Their only source of income is their fanbase. Their bigoted, sectarian fanbase. Thus, they pander to their every whim. Club 1872 ( that nameLOL ) got their wish on Saturday. It allowed them to deflect and deny. An onfield hammering? Never mind, there&#39;s a squirrel. And so it continues.<br>Hopefully in the fullness of time, this bastard child of Deidco will perish too. They are certainly laying the groundwork as we speak. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Teams</font></h3>  <b>Celtic</b>  <ul><li class="MsoNormal">24 de Vries</li><li class="MsoNormal">23 Lustig</li><li class="MsoNormal">28 Sviatchenko</li><li class="MsoNormal">02 K Tour&eacute;<i> Booked at 49mins</i></li><li class="MsoNormal">63 Tierney</li><li class="MsoNormal">08 Brown Substituted for McGregor      at 74&#39;minutes</li><li class="MsoNormal">06 Bitton<i> Booked at 8mins</i></li><li class="MsoNormal">49 Forrest Substituted for Roberts      at 64&#39;minutes<i> Booked at 80mins</i></li><li class="MsoNormal">18 Rogic Substituted for Armstrong      at 54&#39;minutes</li><li class="MsoNormal">11 Sinclair</li><li class="MsoNormal">10 Dembele<i> Booked at 84mins</i></li></ul>  <b>Substitutes</b>  <ul><li class="MsoNormal">01 Gordon</li><li class="MsoNormal">03 Izaguirre</li><li class="MsoNormal">07 Ciftci</li><li class="MsoNormal">12 Gamboa</li><li class="MsoNormal">14 Armstrong</li><li class="MsoNormal">27 Roberts</li><li class="MsoNormal">42 McGregor</li></ul>Goals<ul><li>Dembele (33&#39;

Here is how the two teams rated at Celtic Park.<br><br>CELTIC<br><br>DORUS DE VRIES: Took over from Craig Gordon immediately after being signed by Brendan Rodgers. The Dutchman made his Old Firm debut and had little to do, aside from the goal. 6/10<br><br>MIKAEL LUSTIG: The Sweden right-back enjoyed a good battle with Barrie McKay and came out with more than honours even. 7<br><br>KOLO TOURE: Another debutant in the fixture, the former Arsenal, Manchester City and Liverpool defender showed his experience in handling the Gers attacks. 7<br><br>READ MORE: Celtic 5 - 1 Rangers: Moussa Dembele hat-trick destroys Gers<br><br>ERIK SVIATCHENKO: Scored against Rangers in the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final defeat at Hampden last season but had little impact on this affair. 6<br><br>KIERAN TIERNEY: Recovered from the ankle knock that kept him out the Scotland squad for last Sunday&rsquo;s win in Malta, the teenage left-back got in a few good crosses, especially in first-half. 6<br><br>SCOTT BROWN: All eyes were on the Celtic captain and his clash with Joey Barton who had described him as being &ldquo;nowhere near my level&rdquo; but it was a mostly insipid battle between the two players. 6.<br><br>NIR BITTON: An unspectacular but efficient midfielder, he set up Dembele for his second. 6<br><br>JAMES FORREST: Found his form under Rodgers and got some decent crosses in from the right although at the other times he could have proved more of a threat from good position. 6<br><br>TOM ROGIC: One of Celtic&rsquo;s best players this season, the Australian looked to inspire from midfield with some nifty foot work but was repalaced early in the second-half by Armstrong. 6<br><br>SCOTT SINCLAIR: The jet-heeled winger provided the corner for Dembele&rsquo;s opener and was always a danger. Added a third with a good finish. 7<br><br>MOUSSA DEMBELE: Given a start due to Leigh Griffiths&rsquo; injury, the French striker started slowly but grew in confidence after getting the opener to go and get his hat-trick. 9<br><br>READ MORE: Scott Brown v Joey Barton: who won the midfield battle?<br><br>SUBSTITUTES<br><br>STUART ARMSTRONG: (on 54, for Rogic): The former Dundee United midfielder looked fresh and purposeful, adding a fifth. 6.<br><br>PATRICK ROBERTS: (on 64, for Forrest): Missed an open goal against Rangers at Hampden last season and had to come off the bench for Forrest and worked hard to open up the Gers defence further. 5<br><br>CALLUM MCGREGOR: (on 74, for Brown): The midfielder replaced Brown when the points were secure. 5<br><br>RANGERS<br><br>WES FODERINGHAM: Could do little about any of the goals he conceded but was fortunate his spill just after Dembele&rsquo;s first goal did not prove more costly. 5<br><br>JAMES TAVERNIER: Swung over the cross which got Rangers back into proceedings but had a difficult afternoon trying to deal with Sinclair&rsquo;s pace and trickery. 5<br><br>ROB KIERNAN: It was the centre-back&rsquo;s blunder which handed the home side their second goal as he fed the ball straight to Bitton. Looked weak at the opener too. 5<br><br>PHILIPPE SENDEROS: The former Arsenal defender had a nightmare debut. He was at fault for all of Celtic&rsquo;s first three goals and then left his team up against it for the final 15 minutes as he collected a second booking for a crazy handball. 4<br><br>LEE WALLACE: The Rangers skipper tried to get forward in the first half but looked more concerned about the trickery of Forrest. Had to fill in at centre-half when Kiernan and Senderos both departed. 5<br><br>JOEY BARTON: The spotlight was on the former England midfielder after his pre-match boasts about bossing Brown but it was his failure to get to grips with Rogic when Rangers gave most of the troubles early on. 5<br><br>NIKO KRANJCAR: Mark Warburton gambled on starting with the Croatian, who has not looked fully sharp since arriving in the summer. He put himself about more this time but skated close to the edge with some of his tackles and it was no surprise he did not reappear for the second half after picking up a booking. 5<br><br>JOSH WINDASS: Back after a six-week hamstring lay-off but looked keen to make his mark as he got his head down and ran at the Celtic defence. His final ball, though, lacked a cutting edge. 7<br><br>KENNY MILLER: Spent most of his time on the pitch tracking back to help Tavernier deal with Sinclair. Did provide Joe Garner with an assist though. 6<br><br>JOE GARNER: Gave Rangers belief on the stroke of half-time when he nodded home his first goal for the club from close range but otherwise found himself isolated up front. 6<br><br>BARRIE McKAY: The Scotland winger was not his usual threat in possession as he gifted the ball away time and again. Did come close to an equaliser just after half-time but that was a rare highlight. 5<br><br>SUBSTITUTES<br><br>ANDY HALLIDAY (on 46, for Kranjcar): Thrown on to solidify the Rangers midfield at half-time but could not stop the onslaught. 5<br><br>MARTYN WAGHORN (on 63, for Miller): Had a chance right at the death to add a touch of respectability to the scoreline. 5<br><br>HARRY FORRESTER (on 71, for Kiernan): The game was gone by the time the playmaker was introduced. 4  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br><br>By Tom English<br><br>BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br><br> 4 hours ago From the section Football <br><br>Celtic&#39;s Mikael Lustig and Moussa Dembele celebrate<br>Moussa Dembele is the first Celtic player to score three in a league Old Firm derby since 1966<br><br>Moussa Dembele scored a hat-trick as Celtic hammered Rangers in their first league derby for four years.<br><br>He rose above a static defence to head in from a corner then pounced on a Rob Kiernan mistake with a deft finish.<br><br>Joe Garner headed a reply before the break, but Dembele set up Scott Sinclair for a finish off a post.<br><br>Rangers&#39; Philippe Senderos was sent off after a handball led to a second yellow card, before Dembele and Stuart Armstrong exposed the 10 men.<br><br>Victory lifts Brendan Rodgers&#39; Scottish Premiership leaders - and reigning champions - four points clear of their city rivals, who started the day in second place, with a game in hand.<br><br>Mark Warburton&#39;s visitors, who won the Championship title last season, rarely looked like rescuing even a point once Dembele, the summer arrival from Fulham having started in place of the injured Leigh Griffiths, opened the scoring after a fairly even first 33 minutes.<br><br>The French striker thus became the first player to score a hat-trick in an Old Firm league derby for 50 years.<br><br>Celtic are now unbeaten in 17 games in all competitions and their dominant performance sets them up nicely for Tuesday&#39;s opening Champions League group game against Barcelona.<br>Dembele steps up<br><br>To lose a striker of Griffiths&#39; quality - he will not play in Barcelona either - was a blow for Celtic.

There were two today as my father was five years dead  today, so it was ironic we scored five goals and obviously Jock Stein  was 31 years today.<br>&ldquo;In one of Jock&rsquo;s quotes he talked about that any  football game was only about getting the two points because obviously  back then it was two points. I said to the players today, for us, it&rsquo;s  about getting three points, but when you beat one of your rivals, it&rsquo;s a  wee bit sweeter and that was the message.<br>&ldquo;But the message was  primarily about a guy looking down who set the tone and the template for  this club, and if he is looking down, making sure we do him proud.  <br>&ldquo;This  is a guy who created a template of playing football here and hopefully  he is looking down proud and sees a team with that mentality still to do  this day &ndash; front foot, aggressive, no fear.<br>&ldquo;And when things go  against you, showing that mentality to bounce back. It&rsquo;s still very  early. We have only been in a few months but with the players we have  here and the couple of additions we have brought in, they are working at  a very good level.&rdquo;<br>The Irishman was delighted with every member of  the side after they dominated the game from start to the finish on a  memorable day in Paradise.<br>And the fabulous victory, coming on the  back of international week, maintained Celtic&rsquo;s 100 per cent start to  the season and moved them four points clear at the top of the table,  with a game in hand.<br>The Hoops boss: &ldquo;It was a great day for the club  and the team. It was a brilliant team performance. If you think of all  the travelling this team has put in over the last couple of weeks, with a  lot of players away, to get back in and produce that level of  performance with that energy in the team, I thought it was an  outstanding team performance.<br>&ldquo;We were very prepared for the game.  You have to be as Mark has done an excellent job with Rangers in how he  gets the team to play.<br>&ldquo;I felt today, in every element of football,  we earned the right to win a game of football. Our aggression and our  pressing high up the pitch was very good and that allows us to pass.<br>&ldquo;When you press the game well, you can get on the ball and pass it and that allowed us to create opportunities.<br>&ldquo;We  kept good tactical discipline and the second goal came from that. We  wanted to press, but at times when you can&rsquo;t press you have to drop out,  and for that we were able to win the ball and score on the  counter-attack.<br>&ldquo;We showed lots of elements of the team today and  hopefully you can see the development from maybe a few months ago when  there was bad feeling from the loss at Hampden. Today there was a very  dominant performance and we showed lots of great traits in the game.&rdquo; <br><br><a class="external" href="http://www.celticfc.net/news/11265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.celticfc.net/news/11265</a><br><br></div></div>
