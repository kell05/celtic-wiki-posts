He scored 40 goals in 63 appearances for the Bully  Wee before a &pound;30,000 move south to Sunderland in November 1964. Harry  never really settled on Wearside and after 9 goals in 31 appearances he  returned north back to Shawfield for a reported &pound;13,000. <br><br>He carried on his fine form with Clyde with the club finishing third in the league in season 1966/67 giving Glasgow clubs the top three positions in the league.<br><br>At International level, he was incredibly never capped at full level with Scotland. Harry appeared four  times in the unofficial world tour in 1967 by a Scotland squad. He  scored in his only Under 23 appearance for Scotland against England on 7  February 1968. <br><br><b>Celtic Career<br></b>All this did not go  unnoticed at Celtic Park and Harry duly signed for the Hoops on 16 March  1969 for a fee of &pound;40,000 and he made a scoring debut days later at  Love Street against St Mirren in a 3-0 win.  <br><br>Harry played in all  last seven league games of the 1968/69 season scoring 5 goals in the  process. He was in the side that clinched the title at Rugby Park on a  night when Tommy Gemmell scored a last gasp dramatic equaliser to give  Celtic the point required on April 21st, to claim their fourth  successive league. Harry had came in to strengthen what was already  considered Celtic&#39;s greatest ever squad of players and it was clear that  he would be in line for a place the next season as he watched Celtic  complete the treble with cup wins against Hibs and Rangers.<br><br><div>An  odd statistic that might be difficult to beat is that Hood scored on  his debuts for Celtic in every competition as well as against Rangers: <br><br><blockquote>March 29 1969      L  St Mirren 0, Celtic 3       League debut away<br>April 9 1969         L Celtic 5, Falkirk 2 League debut home<br>Aug 9 1969         LC    Celtic 6, Airdrie 1          LC debut home<br>Aug 13 1969        LC    Rangers 2, Celtic 1        LC debut away<br>Oct 1 1969 EC    Celtic 2, Basel 0 EC debut*<br>Jan 24 1970 SC    Celtic 2, Dunfermline 1     SC debut<br><blockquote><br></blockquote><i>*It should be noted that Hood did come on as a substitute against  Basel in the first leg of the European tie that ended 0-0.</i><br></blockquote><br>Mainly a striker, he also played a number of his starts in the outside right position. <br><br>Harry  started the 1969/70 season in fine form and forever won over the hearts  of Celtic fans when he scored the only goal of the game against Rangers  art Ibrox on September 20th 1969, a glorious effort in which he tricked  McKinnon and lashed a shot past the goalkeeper as John Greig slid by in  vain. This was Celtic&#39;s first win at Ibrox for 12 years and Jock  Stein&#39;s first win at Ibrox as Celtic manager. Celtic progressed to the  League Cup final on October 25th and Harry scored in the 2-1 semi final  win over Ayr United. He kept his place in the final at outside-right,  Jimmy Johnstone relegated to the bench, for the occasion. Celtic won 1-0  thanks to Bertie Auld&#39;s early goal and Harry had his first Celtic  winners medal.<br><br>He scored within 45 seconds at Celtic Park on  October 1st against Basle in the European Cup second leg to settle the  nerves as Celtic triumphed 2-0 on the night and 2-0 on aggregate. In  November he scored Celtic&#39;s crucial third goal in the 3-0 win over  Benfica with a lovely glancing header. In the second leg a Eusebio  inspired Benfica clawed back the three goal deficit but Celtic went  through on the toss of a coin and were grateful to Hood&#39;s effort at  Parkhead. After this Harry was in and out of the side and although he  came on as a sub for Jimmy Quinn at Tynecastle when Celtic won their  fifth successive title on March 28th, he found himself as non playing  sub in the two legged European Cup semi final against Leeds and absent  from the Scottish Cup final side against Aberdeen, all in April 1970. In  the 1970 European Cup final against Feyenoord on May 6th he was on the  bench again and one can only ponder what may have happened had he played  on that fateful night when Celtic went down meekly by 2-1.<br><br>The  1970/71 season was probably Harry&#39;s best for Celtic when he finished top  scorer with 33 goals. On September 12th he received criticism from  Stein when he declined the chance to take a penalty, Jim Brogan instead  blasting over the bar, although Celtic were worthy winners by 2-0.  Celtic at this time were chasing their six in a row league title and  when a fine Aberdeen side under Eddie Turnbull beat them at Parkhead in  December and went top they knew they had a fight on their hands. Harry  scored 21 goals in 15 league and cup games to keep Celtic in the hunt  for the double the most vital goal coming in the cup replay against  Dunfermline at East End Park on February 17th. On April 17th the league  decider came at Pittodrie when Celtic had to avoid defeat or risk losing  their crown. Harry scored the vital opening goal in only three minutes  at a packed Pittodrie and although Aberdeen equalised Celtic held their  nerve to become champions yet again. <br><br>In the Scottish Cup Harry  scored in the semi final and replay, against a spirited Airdrie team, to  face Rangers in the final. The game was a disappointment as Celtic  allowed Rangers a late equaliser after dominating but they made no  mistake in the replay by winning 2-1 with Hood scoring the winner from  the penalty spot after Jimmy Johnstone was scythed in the area. Harry  had now proved himself as a great Celt by being instrumental in the  double winning triumphs. In the European Cup he had scored a hat trick  against Kokkola but they bowed out to the great Johan Cruyff inspired  Ajax side by 3-1 on aggregate. He also gained a Scottish League cap  against the League of Ireland due to his good form at this time.<br><br>After  his success of the previous season the 1971/72 season was something of a  disappointment for him as the young talents of Lou Macari and Kenny  Dalglish burst on the scene making competition for places in the first  eleven extremely harsh. Harry was at outside right on April 15th 1972  when Celtic won the league for the seventh successive occasion. The  previous month he had an excellent game against Ujpest Dosza in the  European Cup in Budapest when a very young Celtic team had a notable 2-1  win, going through to the semis 3-2 on aggregate. Harry received an  injury and missed the semi against Inter Milan, a great pity as Celtic  lost 5-4 on penalties and Harry, a noted penalty taker, would have been  an asset on the night.<br><br>By the summer of 1972 Harry was now one of  Celtic&#39;s most experienced player in Jock Stein&#39;s regenerated team.  Harry was still a regular in the team but now had a deeper more  withdrawn role behind the strikers. Celtic won their eighth title under  Stein although Harry was not in the team that won it at Easter Road in  the last game of the season.<br><br>Harry had a more starring role in  1973/74 scoring 18 goals in the process. He had scored against Rangers  in the 2-1 League Cup win at Ibrox on August 18th in the group stages  and both those teams qualified and proceeded to meet in the semi final  at Hampden on December 5th. Celtic thumped Rangers 3-1 with Hood scoring  a hat trick, even managing to have a fourth goal controversially  disallowed late on. Harry became a legend on that evening becoming one  of a select band of Celtic players who have scored a hat trick against  Rangers. Celtic were champions again and Harry was in the number 7  shorts when the title was clinched at Brockville on April 27th and  Celtic had their 9 in a row. In the 1974 Scottish Cup final win over  Dundee United Harry had an excellent match and headed the first goal in  Celtic&#39;s 3-0 win and thus another domestic double was won.<br><br>Harry  Hood is the last Celt to score a hat-trick against Rangers which  he  achieved in that League Cup semi-final at Hampden in 1973.<br><br>By  1974 Harry was on the periphery of the first team although he was still  brought in for the big occasions. He had a virtuoso performance in  Celtic&#39;s 6-3 thrashing if Hibs in the 1974 League Cup final and was in  the side that brought the Scottish Cup to Parkhead on May 3rd 1975 when  Airdrie were beaten 3-1.<br><br>The 1975/76 season was Harry&#39;s last in  the hoops and it was a difficult one with Sean Fallon in charge after  Jock Stein&#39;s car injuries in the summer of 1975. Harry was relied upon  for his experience although it was not a successful season as no  trophies were won. On April 10th 1976 Harry Hood made his last  appearance for Celtic in a 3-2 defeat at Tannadice.<br><br>Harry Hood&#39;s  signing was a master stroke by Jock Stein, a player who could  comfortably play in any of the five forward positions. A versatile  player, Harry could be relied upon as an out and out striker, a creator  in a deep position or, occasionally in a wide role. Hood was one of that  rare breed who was comfortable with either foot and could play on  either side of the attack. He was a magnificent finisher, often keeping a  cool head and being capable of placing the ball into the net. He played  for Celtic during a golden period of the club&#39;s history and made a  massive contribution to the success that Celtic enjoyed. Harry Hood is  well remembered by the supporters as a great Celtic player.<br><br>Alongside  Tommy Callaghan, Harry was more than deserving to have represented his  country and both of them are two of the best Celts who were never capped  for Scotland - for whatever reason - a ridiculous state of affairs.<br><br>The fans had several songs with his name in it from pop songs of the period :</div><blockquote><i>&#39;We&#39;ve got Harry and Lou Macari and Kevin Barry...oh Harry Hood !&#39;,<br><br>&#39;Harry, oh Harry, Harry, oh Harry, Harry...&#39;, to the chorus of George Harrison&#39;s My Sweet Lord.<br><br>&#39;We don&#39;t need your Colin Stein<br>Joe Harper or Alan Gilzean<br>We&#39;ve got someone twice as good<br>We&#39;ve got Harry, Harry Hood&#39;<br><br>&#39;We don&#39;t need your Jairzinho<br>Beckenbauer or Eusebio<br>We&#39;ve got someone twice as good<br>We&#39;ve got Harry, Harry Hood<br><br>&#39;Harry, Harry, Harry Hood<br>He&#39;s half the price and he&#39;s twice as good !&#39;<br><br>&#39;Oh Harry Hood, Harry, Harry Hood...oh Harry Hood !&#39;</i>, to the tune of Mammy Blue by Roger Whittaker.<br></blockquote><div><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>   He moved onto the US and then back to Scotland with Motherwell for a  season before a spell with Queen of the South. He tried his hand at  management with Albion Rovers in 1981 before a five week stay in the hot  seat at Palmerston Park with Queen of the South before resigning.  <br><br>After  football, he moved into the drinks trade and was owner of Scottish  company Lisini Pub Co, which owns and runs several pubs and restaurants  in the Greater Glasgow Area.</div><div><br>He  passed away in May 2019, just one day after Celtic had sealed the  historic domestic Treble-Treble, something he would have been very much  proud of. He had battled cancer which went into remission, but sadly it  returned.<br><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>  </div><h3>  </h3><h3>Quotes</h3></div><div>&quot;Celtic is so much a part of me that my one aim is to be a success with them and keep at the top as long as I can.&quot;</div><div><b>Harry Hood, an early quote and he more than achieved that.</b></div><div> <b><br></b></div><div></div><div>&quot;When he left Celtic, the team&#39;s flair went with him.

On such days I walk for miles, and we are on  nodding acquaintance with every horse and pony for miles around with our  seemingly inexhaustible supply of old carrots and apples.<br><br>As an  aside, have you ever noticed dear reader, how smartly packaged  vegetables and fruit from our various supermarkets go off very quickly  once you have them home, even if kept in a cool and dry place. One  consequence of this phenomenon is that our various equine buddies gallop  towards us as soon as the buggy hoves into sight.<br><br>This week the  weather has not been so brilliant and we &ndash; I &ndash; decided to pass on our  afternoon perambulation. but to attempt to entertain the troops at home.  Since Balamory was not on T.V. we were listening to a c.d. called  &lsquo;Hello Children &ndash; Everywhere&rsquo;. <br><br>Those of my own generation will  recognise these words as the introduction to &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s Favourites&rsquo;, a  programme hosted by &lsquo;Uncle Mac&rsquo;, in which children could write in and  request music every Saturday Morning &ndash; I think on the BBC Home Service.  In these days of wall to wall audio and video entertainment it is hard  to imagine a much simpler world, in which tunes such as &lsquo;The Deadwood  Stage&rsquo;, &lsquo;The Ballad of Davy Crockett&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Nelly the Elephant&rsquo; would  compete for air time with &lsquo;All Things Bright and Beautiful&rsquo;.<br><br>A  programme regular at the time &lsquo;The Ballad of Robin Hood&rsquo;, a tune which  is on the c.d. brought to mind a Celtic player of no little ability who  was one of my own favourites whilst he graced the Hoops. A small group  of my friends, who attended most matches when not playing, would parody  this song to the effect:<br><br><i>Harry Hood, Harry Hood running down the wing<br>Harry Hood, Harry Hood makes the fans all sing<br>Feared by the bad, <br>Loved by the good<br>Harry Hood, Harry Hood, Harry Hood.</i><br><br>When  I went to college in Manchester, Harry Hood was a Sunderland player. He  had played for Clyde and Celtic tried to buy him, but for some reason  he signed for Sunderland &ndash; the so-called &lsquo;Bank of England Club&rsquo; of the  period and that - it appeared - was that. <br><br>My room-mate in the  hostel was a guy called Peter Wright, who had been on Sheffield United&rsquo;s  books as a youngster, and had played trials for England Schools before  suffering a bad injury which put an end to his prospects of a  professional career. He remained an amateur footballer of real talent,  whose game was all about touch and skill, and who appreciated these  qualities in other players.<br><br>One of the stories he told me of his  footballing exploits concerned a visit to Glasgow with Sheffield Schools  to play a match against Glasgow Schools. To his disgust, it transpired  that the match was to take place on a red blaze pitch, so beloved of the  Scottish amateur game. As the teams lined up he noticed that one of the  opposition was wearing sandshoes and his growing contempt for Scottish  Football went up another notch &ndash; or at least it did for ninety minutes.<br><br>When  the final whistle blew, Glasgow Schools had recorded a victory, which  according to my friend was entirely down to the efforts of Sandshoe  Sammy, otherwise known - he later discovered &ndash; as Harry Hood. He told me  that Harry had run rings around the English boys, who according to my  friend, had a terrific team with several schoolboy caps in their midst.  They could do nothing with Harry, whose ball skills were unrivalled even  on a crap surface and Peter said that he was the best player he ever  played against by a mile.<br><br>When Celtic went back for Harry in the  late 1960&rsquo;s it was a second chance which he did not turn down and they  acquired a classy player whose career to that point was really  unfulfilled. He had gone back to Clyde, and it looked as if he would  play out his days there, but following a couple of brilliant displays  against the Hoops, Stein paid Clyde &pound;40,000 in March 1969, thereby  recruiting a player whose skills were undeniable but who had yet to  fulfil what many saw as his potential. Whilst it would be stretching the  truth to suggest that Harry took on the mantle of players such as  Bertie Auld or Joe McBride, he became an important part of the team for  the next few years playing his part in many great wins and scoring  freely, while never really a striker in the Lennox or Wallace mould.<br><br>Amongst  the highlights of his time at Celtic were a brilliant hat-trick against  the FOD in the semi-final of the league cup at Hampden, the winner at  Ibrox for a ten-man Celtic following Jim Craig&rsquo;s dismissal, and a  beautiful headed goal against Benfica at Celtic Park which we all  confidently thought had put the tie out of reach of the Portuguese  champions. He was never an automatic choice but when he played brought a  touch of class to the party and few more graceful players have donned  the Hoops in my lifetime.<br><br>In the recent reminiscences about Mr.  Stein, Bob Crampsey recalled a discussion which he had during a question  and answer session which they both attended in Dunfermline. He quoted  Stein as saying that you would not win many leagues with a team composed  entirely of Charlie Gallaghers and Harry Hoods. Crampsey&rsquo;s reply that  any team which did not have at least one such player would be unlikely  to win many either, received a grudging acknowledgement from our gruff  genius. It is interesting that even Stein, for all the aesthetic  brilliance of his teams, was slightly suspicious of players who offered  little in terms of the broadsword, but rather who depended on the  rapier.<br><br>As a footnote to this homage to one of Celtic&rsquo;s less  celebrated, but certainly most skilful players, I would like to relate a  short tale of my period as a conductor on Glasgow Corporation&rsquo;s buses.  There used to be small fittings above the seats which held adverts for  various goods and services.<br><br>In very fine pencil &ndash; tiny letters &ndash;  barely visible, I used to write &lsquo;Viva Harry Hood&rsquo; on the sign above the  conductor&rsquo;s seat on every bus I took out. One night whilst having my tea  in the garage canteen, my driver (a fellow Tim) and I were greatly  amused when one of the more rabid follow followers stormed into to begin  his break exclaiming: &lsquo;I<i>f ah ever go oan another bus wi&rsquo; that Viva f$%&rdquo;*&rsquo;n Harry f$%&rdquo;*&rsquo;n Hood am gonnae go f$%&rdquo;*&rsquo;n mental&rsquo;</i>.<br><br>Cue  our quiet departure, containing our hilarity until we were out of  earshot, but if ever a slogan was appropriate it was Viva Harry Hood.<div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div><h3>  Sad passing of Celtic great, Harry Hood</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/15993<br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 26 May, 2019 10:31<br>Tweet<br><br>Everyone  at Celtic is saddened at the death of Harry Hood, who has passed away  at the age of 74. A Celtic great, Harry made 310 appearances for the  Hoops between 1969 and &rsquo;76, scoring a very impressive 123 goals.<br><br>Having  started his playing career with Clyde, he had a spell with Sunderland  before returning to Clyde, and it was after three seasons with the Bully  Wee that Jock Stein brought him to Celtic.<br><br>Celtic were blessed  with exceptional, world-class strikers at that time, having won the  European Cup two years previously, but Harry Hood offered something  different to the rest. He had skill, poise and a touch of real class.  When given a chance in front of goal, he rarely panicked. The supporters  loved him and were happy to immortalise another hero in a varied  repertoire of songs.<br><br>Hood&rsquo;s 123 goals in 310 appearances prove  that his signing was another masterstroke from Jock Stein. He augmented a  vibrant group of forwards and the medals flowed. Indeed, the first of  those 123 goals came on his debut, a 3-0 league win over St Mirren at  Love Street on March 29, 1969.<br><br>Harry won the League Cup that same  year to pick up his first piece of silverware as the Hoops beat St  Johnstone 1-0 in the final, and he never looked back. When Harry left  Celtic in 1976, he took away six Scottish League medals, four Scottish  Cup medals and two League Cup medals &ndash; a very impressive haul.<br><br>He  won the league every season from 1968/69 to 1973/74 and lifted the  Scottish Cup in 1971, 1972, 1973 and 1975 and the League Cup in 1969 and  1974. In 1970/71, Hood was Celtic&rsquo;s top scorer with 33 goals.<br><br>In  a fiercely competitive era, full international honours never came  Harry&rsquo;s way, but his club exploits made up for that disappointment.<br><br>Aside  from Celtic, he also played for Clyde, Sunderland, Motherwell and Queen  of the South. He also had a spell in America after leaving Celtic.  Wherever he went, Hood scored goals. That knack never deserted him.<br><br>Hood  deserves his place in Celtic folklore. He wasn&rsquo;t a Lisbon Lion or a  Quality Street Kid, but he fitted in perfectly at Celtic. He had the  X-Factor that helped the team win games and in many ways he was the  classic Celtic player. His record of 123 goals and 12 major honours  stands comparison with the greats.<br><br>The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Harry&#39;s family and friends at this extremely sad time.  <div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>  </div><div>  </div><div>  </div><br><img align="bottom" alt="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" height="643" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/fc413b516780ce308c2737033f969985/GW547H643" title="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" width="547"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" height="643" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/ed6af61faad33f874c28de42754e8777/GW538H643" title="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" width="538"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" height="881" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/544315d57e126d7bff865e8d22222aa5/GW682H881" title="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" width="682"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" height="793" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/7fdf16893c363bb2cd32599ffb7f5122/GW703H793" title="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" width="703"><br><br><div><h3><br></h3></div><div><h3> Obituary: Harry Hood, Celtic star </h3></div>Herald Scotland <div> Celtic star Born: October 3, 1944; Died: May 26, 2019 <br><br>HARRY Hood, who has died aged 74, was a star of Celtic who made 310 appearances for the club after joining them in 1969. The same year Beatle George Harrison started writing My Sweet Lord and the fans were quick to adapt the song as a tribute to their 25-year-old centre forward. Harrison&rsquo;s lyrics were &ldquo;Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna Krishna, Krishna &hellip; Hare Hare&rdquo; but hey soon became &ldquo;Harry, Harry; Harry, Harry, Harry Hood.&rdquo; Hood won many great matches for Clyde, Sunderland, and Celtic but this week lost his battle against cancer. </div><div></div><div>His death comes only weeks after those of Celtic legends Billy McNeil and Steve Chalmers - a sad and poignant time for the Celtic family. </div><div></div><div>Born Henry Anthony Hood in October 1944 in Stobhill Hospital with the Second World War still raging, Harry went on to become a fan favourite and one of soccer&rsquo;s most successful businessmen after hanging up his boots. He grew up in his Garthamlock home with parents Mary and Harry, alongside brothers George, Jack and Peter and sisters Irene and Patricia.</div><div></div><div>He was educated at Saint Aloysius College, playing rugby until 15, only taking up football when he moved to Holyrood Secondary School. Playing in a team alongside Celtic giants like Jimmy Johnstone, Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain, John Clark, Lou Macari, Billy McNeil and Dixie Deans, Hood finished as Scotland&rsquo;s top scorer in 1971. His most stunning feat was a memorable hat-trick in the 1973 League Cup semi-final against Rangers. </div><div></div><div>After leaving Celtic he plied his trade in Texas playing for the San Antonio Thunder alongside England&rsquo;s iconic captain Bobby Moore, and Scots exiles, Bobby Clark, Jim Forrest and former Celtic team-mate Tommy Callaghan. In 20 games in the scorching heat he found the net ten times. </div><div></div><div></div><div>His swansong years followed with spells at Motherwell and Queen of the South and short spells managing Albion Rovers and Queen of the South. The two colourful characters running the Rovers and Queens in those days were Willie Harkness and Tom Fagan, men who thought they were kings of wheeling and dealing, but they hadn&rsquo;t met Harry Hood, one of the sharpest brains in football. </div><div></div><div>Deciding football chairmen had all the talent of Pinocchio when it came to keeping a football promise, Hood turned his energies to his fledgling leisure business. With Harry at the helm and accompanied by his wife Kathleen, the Lisini Pub Company has grown into a multi-million pound business. The portfolio in the family-run business has expanded with top quality restaurants, hotels, function suites and bars. Throughout these years Lisini have been great supporters of a variety of charities raising big amounts for a range of good causes including the Beatson Cancer Charity.</div><div></div><div> The name Lisini comes from daughters Lisa and Siobhan and son Nicholas who have all played their part in the group along with Harry&rsquo;s nephew Grant Hood. But Lisini&rsquo;s greatest accolade has been the ever-expanding clientele, many of whom hoped to meet Harry who always found time to chat and recount football yarns with clients. </div><div></div><div></div><div>In 2018 Harry Hood was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award by his old friend and leisure entrepreneur James Mortimer at a Scottish Entertainment and Hospitality ceremony. There were tears that night, some of pride, but many of the tears amongst those who knew the battle Harry was fighting. Perhaps one story sums up the fun and laughter behind Harry Hood. In 2017 his Angels Hotel was reopened after a facelift. There to open the new &ldquo;Harry&rsquo;s Bar&rdquo; was the then Celtic superstar Moussa Dembele. After 50 odd years Moussa had joined Harry as only the second Celtic player to score a hat-trick against Rangers in a cup game. Harry said, &ldquo;Moussa was such a nice lad, I didn&rsquo;t have the heart to tell him I actually scored four goals in that game against Rangers. The linesman decided to call one offside. It was never offside.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div> While his wife, children, six grand-children and immediate family mourn in private, remembering a warm hearted man who cared passionately about his family there will be a wider audience who will shed a tear or two. Lisini has lost their team captain; football fans of a certain genre have lost one of the most flamboyant players of the sixties and seventies; Scotland&rsquo;s leisure industry has lost a great champion and the thousands of people who came to know Henry Anthony Hood have lost a great friend.</div><div></div><div> JIM CASSIDY </div><div></div><div></div><div>--</div><div>Moussa Dembele via twitter</div><div>&ldquo;What you achieved will last in history forever&rdquo;. Kinds words from a kind and humble gentleman. Another Celtic legend left us today... Sad to hear the passing of my fellow derby hat-trick scorer Mr Harry Hood . Condolences to his family and friends. #RIPLegend https://t.co/HDJsRsmIsy</div> <div><img align="bottom" alt="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" height="533" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/049979599edf55df0720faaf40baefac/GW606H533" title="Hood, Harry - The Celtic Wiki" width="606"></div><div></div><div><h3>Clyde fc</h3></div><div>http://m.clydefc.co.uk/news/2019/05/26/6129/</div><div></div><div>Harry Hood Sun, 26th May 2019 11:48am All connected with Clyde FC are extremely saddened to hear of the passing of Harry Hood. Harry joined the club in the Summer of 1962 and made his debut against Rangers at Ibrox in November of that year. A week later he scored his first goal for The Bully Wee, against Aberdeen at Shawfield. </div><div></div><div> Unfortunately, at the end of that season Clyde were relegated to the Second Division, but were to come straight back up the following season as runners-up to a rampant Morton side. Harry ended that successful 1963-64 season as top scorer, with 37 goals from 45 appearances. </div><div></div><div>His skill and goalscoring prowess continued to shine through in the First Division, with Harry scoring 11 goals in his 19 appearances up to November 1964. </div><div></div><div>Almost two years to the day that he made his Clyde debut, Harry made the big move down South, joining Sunderland for a fee of &pound;30,000. It didn&#39;t go completely to plan for Harry down at Roker Park and in October 1966 Clyde manager Davie White brought Harry back to Clyde from Sunderland for a reported &pound;13,000 fee. </div><div></div><div>Harry&rsquo;s form with Clyde effectively continued where he had left off and he certainly played his part in Clyde&#39;s magnificent 1966-67 season. In the following two seasons, Harry finished as the club&rsquo;s top scorer, which is all the more creditable given that he didn&rsquo;t complete the latter season. </div><div></div><div>In March 1969, Harry was on the move again; this time it was the much shorter journey to Celtic Park, with the fee reported as &pound;40,000. At the end of his second spell with The Bully Wee, Harry had featured in 197 matches for Clyde, scoring an outstanding total of 96 goals. </div><div>In recent years Harry was given the honour of being inducted into the club&#39;s Hall of Fame twice; the first occasion in his own right, the second occasion coming as part of the entire 1966-67 squad.</div><br></div>
