No last 16, but reasons to believe for next season.</font><br>  </font><br>(fatboab of KDS)<br>morning after the night before<br><br>So we are out, but we can at least hold our heads high. A very Scottish sentiment in truth, but given the magnitude of the task we were presented with, we faired pretty well.<br><br>The Nou Camp was a hardcore lesson from which we learned plenty, the loss to BMG a big disappointment. The 3-3 draw v City was exhilarating, and the rest was more than satisfactory. To achieve two draws away from home is something to build on, and perhaps wth a touch more fortune/quality, we could have won both those games.<br><br>Chances have to be taken at this level. It&#39;s a cliche, but it&#39;s absolutely 100% correct.<br><br>Moussa&#39;s penalty in the Nou Camp, or his header at CP v Barca at 0-1. McGregor&#39;s huge chance in Germany and the trio of great chances that fell to Moussa, GMS and Griffiths last night. These are the moments that change games and destinations.<br><br>Brendan Rogers has achieved miracles thus far with this group of players. If his word is to be believed, and there&#39;s no reason to doubt him, then with a few astute signings and a lorry load of coaching, we may see real progress in Europe over the next few years.<br><br>The game last night was thrilling and disappointing in equal measure. We should have won.<br><br>Great performances from Brown, Armstrong, Rogic, Forrest and our two centre backs, with Roberts adding the cherry on top , auger well for the future. <br><br>Dembele has gone a bit stale, Lustig was done with real pace, and Izzy , despite my undying support, is nowhere near as good as Tierney. He passed us into trouble regularly throughout the game. Gordon was suspect at the goal,  but made a great save later. He is what he is, a really good keeper prone to the odd gaffe.<br><br>All in all, we took more from the group than many of us suspected, and we have plenty to build on for next time round. We have to become ruthless though, and win the games we deserve to win. There are no great losers in the CL, just losers.<br><br>Our Board simply HAVE to back Rogers as best they can. Two or three more quality players and we&#39;ll be a very good side.<br>It would also help enormously to get a Not Group of Death please.<br><br>(Arsene P of KDS)<br>Individually last night I couldn&#39;t fault anyone&#39;s overall game.<br><br>Quite a few in our squad have grown into players who look more and more at home in the system. <br><br>It&#39;s probably to do with the fact that they&#39;re played in their best positions.<br><br>It was a kind of could have, should have game where we had some missed opportunities.<br><br>I know it wasn&#39;t a full on game because the final placings were settled, so maybe we have to take account of that in assessing why we seemed to play with no fear. If we could just do that when stakes are higher then we&#39;d have no real complaints.<br><br>To improve for winning in European terms we need better players in a couple of key positions, but until that happens we just have to get on with it.<br><br>I hate to think that we might drop any league points between now and the end of the year, but I am aware that it&#39;s very unlikely we can do that given the schedule and the injuries we have and are likely to accrue.<br><br>Having said that, we should just enjoy the entertainment for the rest of this season and when we sign off for the winter break at Ibrox, here&#39;s hoping that the domestic superiority is enforced and see what the transfer window brings so that we&#39;re ready for the games we have to win to pre-qualify to reach the preliminary rounds before winning the final play-off game to get into the group stages next season. <br><br>(Forza of KDS)<br>A solid performance that should have yielded more in the way of goals.<br><br>Still look a bit loose without the ball at times, but I reckon that is always going to be the case with Rodgers based on what he wants us to do to get the ball back.<br><br>Noticed last night that the little wall pass to simply buy ourselves more time on the ball in a congested area was very much in evidence from us. Barca are absolute masters of that to simply keep the ball. We did it a few times last night and retained possession much more easily. A fairly basic observation, but another step on the learning curve on how you play at this level.<br><br>It&#39;s exciting to watch this team. Whereas in previous seasons eight further league games (largely against utter tosh) in December might have filled most with dread, I look forward to the games. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Teams</font></h3><font color="#000000">Man City<br></font><font color="#000000"> 13 Caballero<br> 3 Sagna<br> 53 Adarabioyo<br> 22 Clichy<br> 50 Maffeo</font><font color="#000000"></font><font color="#000000">Substituted for Jes&uacute;s Navas at 62&#39;minutes<br></font><font color="#000000"> 5 Zabaleta<br> 6 Fernando<br> 8 G&uuml;ndoganBooked</font> <font color="#000000">at 79mins<br></font><font color="#000000"> 19 San&eacute;<br> 9 Nolito<br> 72 Iheanacho<br> <br> Substitutes<br> 10Ag&uuml;ero<br> 15Jes&uacute;s Navas<br> 24Stones<br> 30Otamendi<br> 54Gunn<br> 69Angelino<br> 80Foden<br> Goal<br> Iheanacho (8&#39;minutes)<br> <br> Celtic<br> 01 Gordon<br> 23 Lustig Booked</font> <font color="#000000">at 44mins<br></font><font color="#000000"> 05 Simunovic<br> 28 Sviatchenko<br> 03 Izaguirre<br> 08 Brown Booked</font> <font color="#000000">at 85mins<br></font><font color="#000000"> 27 Roberts<br> 18 Rogic<br> 14 Armstrong<br> 49 Forrest</font><font color="#000000"></font><font color="#000000">Substituted for Mackay-Steven at 51&#39;minutes<br></font><font color="#000000"> 10 Dembele</font><font color="#000000"></font><font color="#000000">Substituted for Griffiths at 73&#39;minutes<br></font><font color="#000000"> <br> Substitutes<br> 02 K Tour&eacute;<br> 06 Bitton<br> 09 Griffiths<br> 12 Gamboa<br> 16 Mackay-Steven<br> 24 de Vries<br> 42 McGregor<br> Goal<br> Roberts (4&#39;minutes)<br> <br> Referee:Slavko Vincic<br> Attendance:51,297</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Articles </font></h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  Match Report (see end of page below)   </li></ul>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Pictures </font></h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal"> <a href="/page/2016-12-06%3A+Manchester+City+1-1+Celtic%2C+European+Cup+-+Pictures" target="_self" title="Match Pictures"><font color="#0066cc" size="2">Match Pictures</font></a></li></ul>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Forum</font></h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  Pre-match <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011224/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011224/</a>  </li><li class="MsoNormal">  Match <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011597/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011597/</a>  </li><li>  Post Match <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011609/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011609/</a></li></ul>  <h3><font color="#333333">  MOTM</font></h3>  <ul>  <li>  Voting Thread <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011613/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/11011613/</a>  </li><li>  Result Thread   </li><li>  Winner -

It was a reward for a positive start by Rodgers&rsquo; side which saw City keeper Willy Caballero forced to sprint out of his penalty area to deny Moussa Dembele, before saving a follow-up attempt from Tom Rogic.<br> But Caballero was then partially culpable for the goal which opened the scoring. His kick-out to Leroy Sane was overhit with the German winger unable to control the ball as he kept it in play right on the touchline. Mikael Lustig nipped in to seize possession for Celtic and feed Roberts. The young winger cut inside, gliding away from Gael Clichy, before beating Caballero with a firm shot from around eight yards. His celebrations were reasonably modest, in deference to his parent club, but there was no such restraint among the 4000-strong Celtic support at the other end of the stadium.<br> Unfortunately for them, they were only able to savour the lead for four minutes. The Celtic defence was split open by Nolito&rsquo;s through ball which allowed Iheanacho to gain a crucial yard of space ahead of Jozo Simunovic in the penalty area before he fired a left-foot shot high past Craig Gordon.<br> Iheanacho should have put City in front three minutes later when Celtic&rsquo;s back four again found themselves stretched by some slick passing and movement from the hosts. Pablo Zabaleta drove forward down the right and squared the ball to Iheanacho. It was a simpler opportunity than the one he had just finished so impressively, but this time he scuffed his shot wide.<br> But Celtic might easily have regained the lead on the counter attack in the 18th minute when some terrific work from James Forrest saw him play in Dembele on the left of the penalty area. Dembele&rsquo;s finish lacked composure and conviction, however, as his first shot was blocked by Caballero before he sent the rebound wildly off target.<br> Gordon made an excellent save to keep out a cute back-heeled close range effort from Iheanacho after a run from Sane. The ball broke to Nolito whose shot was blocked by Emilio Izaguirre.<br> While City had now imposed themselves as the more persistent attacking force, they were fortunate not to concede a penalty a minute before the interval when Clichy appeared to pull Roberts back. Celtic&rsquo;s appeals went unheeded, however, with Lustig&rsquo;s show of dissent to the additional assistant referee, who was positioned right in line with the incident, earning him a booking.<br> There was a setback for Celtic six minutes after the restart when Forrest, who had been a real thorn in City&rsquo;s side, suffered an injury. He was replaced by Gary Mackay-Steven, the former Dundee United wide man making his first appearance since the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Rangers back in April.<br> He was bright and eager as he looked to make the most of his first chance to bring himself in from the fringes of Rodgers&rsquo; squad. City had the ball in the net when Nolito drove home a cross from substitute Jesus Navas but it was correctly ruled out for offside.<br> Rodgers made his second change of the night when Leigh Griffiths was introduced, replacing Dembele who had been conspicuously short of his optimum form. Griffiths passed up a glorious chance to make a rapid impact, dragging a left foot shot wide from 14 yards after fine set-up play by Mackay-Steven. The closing stages also saw Mackay-Steven denied by a smart save from Caballero when he would feel he should have scored..</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">BBC Manchester City and Celtic played out a low-key draw as their Champions League group phase concluded at Etihad Stadium.<br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> This was a dead rubber with City already assured of second place in Group C and Celtic eliminated with no chance of Europa League football.<br> Celtic started in impressive fashion and on-loan winger Patrick Roberts gave them a fourth-minute lead against his parent club with a crisp finish - an advantage that lasted four minutes before Kelechi Iheanacho drove an angled drive high past Craig Gordon.<br> And Celtic almost cashed in but substitutes Leigh Griffiths and Gary Mackay-Steven wasted late opportunities.<br> City boss Pep Guardiola made nine changes from the team that lost at home to Chelsea on Saturday, including teenagers Pablo Maffeo and Tosin Adarabioyo.<br> Both Guardiola and Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers seemed satisfied at the final whistle, with the only dampener on the night being when scuffles broke out between a small number of rival supporters in the second half.<br> How far can Manchester City go?<br> No judgements can be made from this game, played out with an unfamiliar team with nothing competitive at stake - but City have shown both sides of their personality in this group stage.<br> If they reproduce the blistering form they demonstrated in the second half of their 3-1 win against Barcelona at Etihad Stadium, they have the style and personnel to trouble any team left in the competition.<br> If they show the defensive frailty that saw them lose 4-0 in Barcelona - and which they have shown in the Premier League - then they are just as likely to sabotage their chances.<br> Finishing second in the group usually makes life tougher and they can still land stiff opposition in the likes of Atletico Madrid, Napoli, Monaco, Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund, Juventus or Sevilla.<br> Tough - but nothing to deter City if they can produce their best.<br> Champions League - who&#39;s going through?<br> Group A: PSG and Arsenal <br> Group B: Benfica and Napoli <br> Group C: Barcelona and Manchester City <br> Group D: Atletico Madrid and Bayern Munich <br> Group E: Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen <br> Group F: Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid <br> Group G: Leicester and one of Porto or FC Copenhagen <br> Group H: Juventus and one of Sevilla or Lyon <br> Ludogorets, Besiktas, Borussia Moenchengladbach and FC Rostov have confirmed their places in the Europa League <br> Celtic making progress<br> Rodgers knew it would be a tough task to progress from a group containing Barcelona and Manchester City. And it has proved difficult.<br> But Celtic&#39;s display here was confident and showed signs that they have learned lessons from the experience - although it must be placed in the context of a game played against an unfamiliar City team.<br> Celtic kept City at arm&#39;s length for much of the game and posed a threat, which is exactly what Rodgers will have wanted. They were well-organised and fiercely industrious.<br> If there was a fault it was that they did not make the most of their chances, with Moussa Dembele wasteful in the first half and both Griffiths and Mackay-Steven having opportunities late on.<br> The former Liverpool boss is in a building process at Celtic and while domestic domination looks certain to continue, Rodgers can at least take some solace that they looked to have moved forward in this European campaign.<br> Table<br> City still off colour<br> It&#39;s another home draw for Manchester City as they struggle to rediscover the air of invincibility they carried in the early games following Guardiola&#39;s arrival.<br> This was a night of experimentation for the Catalan but his animated behaviour on the touchline made it obvious how much he wanted victory.<br> It did not materialise and City have now won only four of their past 13 matches. This comes after winning their first 10 competitive fixtures under Guardiola before a 3-3 draw at Celtic in the Champions League.<br> He will hope this magic touch can return soon with the Premier League entering a crucial stage and further Champions League battles ahead.<br> Man of the match - Patrick Roberts (Celtic)<br> Manchester City v Celtic<br> The on-loan Manchester City winger impressed on his return to the Etihad. &quot;We know his quality, he worked really hard and defended well and I&#39;m so happy for him,&quot; said Blues boss Pep Guardiola afterwards.<br> &#39;It was a pleasure to play against Celtic&#39;<br> Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola:<br> &quot;I am so happy. We played really good against a good team. <br> &quot;The experienced players like Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy, Pablo Zabaleta, Fernando and Ilkay Gundogan helped the young players a lot.<br> &quot;It was a good experience for them. They deserved to play because they have trained well. Their behaviour is always perfect so I am so happy to give them the opportunity to play in the Champions League.<br> &quot;The game was good for the spectators, both teams tried to attack. It was fun. It was a pleasure to play against Celtic.&quot;<br> What&#39;s next?<br> Back to the domestic title chase for both teams. <br> Manchester City, who are fourth in the Premier League and four points behind leaders Chelsea, travel to reigning champions Leicester City on Saturday (17:30 GMT).<br> Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic go to second-bottom Partick Thistle on Friday (19:45).
