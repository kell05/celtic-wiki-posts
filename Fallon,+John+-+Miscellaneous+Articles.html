This is John Fallon, once the red-haired idol of the Celtic  fans, but now in genteel retirement, and doing what he loves the most -  watching his beloved Celtic.<br><br>John cannot have missed many games  over the years since he retired, and he has been spotted at venues like  Love Street, Easter Road, Brockville and Rugby Park when Celtic are  supplying the opposition.<br><br>John Fallon was born in Blantyre (where  he still lives) round about the time of The Battle of Britain in 1940,  and 18 years later joined the only team that he was ever likely to want  to play for - Glasgow Celtic.<br><br>His debut came against Clyde in  September 1959, and in one of his early games at Arbroath, he was seen  to make a save and then turn to the punters behind the goal and give  them the &quot;thumbs-up&quot; sign. This horrified the traditionalists, but  showed the Celtic fans that he was one of us.<br><br>For a while he was  the understudy to the eccentric Frank Haffey of Wembley infamy. Frank  was a good goalkeeper, although capable of many &quot;howlers&quot;. John kept  working away waiting for his time to come. It duly did as things began  to pick up in November 1963, and Fallon had a good second half in that  season. Nothing was won, but there was a good run in Europe, and on one  occasion at Greenock in January 1964, Fallon turned round to his fans  with arms aloft to show his appreciation of a good goal scored at the  other end. An over-zealous policeman then told him to stop doing that,  for it might incite the fans!<br><br>For Fallon, the relationship with  the Celtic fans was crucial. In a very special sense, they were Celtic.  Fallon would make the utmost effort to talk to the snotty-nosed  youngsters whom the Welfare State had not quite reached in 1964. He  would be seen talking to the ballboys, even at away grounds, and on one  train journey to Aberdeen, came out of the compartment specially to talk  to the fans when the other members of the team gave the impression that  green and white supporters&#39; scarves got in the way. On that occasion,  when the train stopped at Stonehaven, a couple of youngsters in the red  and white of Aberdeen got on, and they too were talked to by this  unassuming young man whom they clearly did not believe to be Celtic&#39;s  goalkeeper!<br><br>The arrival of Stein in 1965 was preceded by that of  Ronnie Simpson, a veteran of the Olympic Games of 1948, and two English  Cup Finals with Newcastle United in 1952 and 1955. Yet Stein did not  seem to like Simpson, and in Stein&#39;s first Scottish Cup triumph, that  glorious day of deliverance in April 1965, it was Fallon who was in  Celtic&#39;s goal. He saved the day on more than one occasion, when the Pars  pressed hard, he swung on the crossbar at the final whistle, then  rushed off to hospital to be with his wife Essie as she gave birth the  following day.<br><br>There was little wrong with Fallon or Celtic&#39;s world in spring 1965.<br><br>But  John had a bad day (in the eyes of Stein at least) in a game at Ibrox  in September 1965 and Simpson was now given the nod. Many a lesser man  would have taken the huff, handed in a transfer request and thrown the  toys out of the pram. Not a bit of it with this man. He became friends  with Ronnie Simpson, made a point of sitting beside him on the team bus  and learning all that he could from this luminary of the game.<br><br>John  Fallon was thus a spectator at Lisbon, but still counts it as one of  the greatest games of his life. Pictures clearly show him jumping off  the bench at the final whistle and rushing to congratulate Ronnie.<br><br>He  was called upon at short notice to play in the World Club Cup Final in  Argentina in November 1967 when Ronnie Simpson was struck with a  missile. It was something that needed a great deal of courage, but John  let no-one down.<br><br>Everyone recalls the dreadful John Fallon moment  of January 1968. Ronnie had pulled out through injury, and John played  at Parkhead against Rangers. His followers looked on in dismay as he  made two errors to give Rangers an undeserved draw.<br><br>Yet everyone  identified with him several months later when Celtic wrested back the  initiative in the Championship race. He was playing at a deserted  Parkhead against Raith Rovers Reserves. He neither knew nor cared what  the score was, but he did know that the first team were winning the  Glasgow Cup at Hampden that night, and that Morton had drawn with  Rangers in the Scottish League. Celtic duly won the Championship, and  1968 would not be known as &quot;Fallon&#39;s folly&quot;.<br><br>But 1969 was his  &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. An injury in February more or less ended Simpson&#39;s  career, and thus Fallon was involved in that glorious month of April  when Celtic won all three domestic trophies. The sweetest was the 4-0  beating of Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final, when John survived some  dreadful treatment from some thuggish Rangers forwards and saved  everything that came his way.<br><br>Just to put a little icing on the  glorious Treble cake that was 1969, Fallon then played in the League Cup  Final of that year, saving brilliantly twice from Benny Rooney of St.  Johnstone to win another medal.<br><br>It was often said that Stein  could not judge a goalkeeper. He certainly did not keep one for long,  and by the end of that season, John had lost out to Evan Williams, a  competent but by no means brilliant keeper.<br><br>John thus missed out  on the European Cup Final in 1970, and although he hung around until  1972, it was obvious that he was permanently out of favour. He moved to  Motherwell and later Morton, but his heart remained where it still is to  be found on match days, at Parkhead.<br><br>If you see John Fallon, go up and talk to him! He is surely what Celtic Football Club is meant to be about!<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>John Fallon - (TheSun interview)</h3><br>JOHN FALLON has no problem recognising Jock Stein&rsquo;s remarkable achievements as Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever manager.<br><br>But   one of the most decorated keepers in the Hoops&rsquo; 127-year history will   never forgive Stein for how he treated him at Parkhead.<br><br>Fallon&rsquo;s autobiography &lsquo;Keeping in Paradise&rsquo; was launched yesterday in, ironically, the Jock Stein Lounge at Celtic Park.<br><br>On   the front cover there&rsquo;s even a praiseworthy quote from the legendary   manager stating &lsquo;John Fallon is an outstanding example . . . we can be   proud of him&rsquo;.<br><br>Fallon, though, told SunSport those words were   never voiced to him by Stein &mdash; a man he scathingly describes in the book   as being &lsquo;duplicitous&rsquo; and &lsquo;manipulative&rsquo;.<br><br>Back-up to Ronnie   Simpson for the 1967 European Cup triumph, he has harboured bitterness   towards one of the club&rsquo;s most revered figures for 50 YEARS.<br><br>In his eyes, the late Stein was a football genius &mdash; but appalling with man-management.<br><br>Fallon&rsquo;s   hard-hitting book published today doesn&rsquo;t miss the giant who famously   became Hoops boss in 1965 and transformed an ailing team into the best   in Europe and virtually unbeatable in Scotland, winning nine successive   titles and 13 cups.<br><br>At the heart of it all was Fallon.<br><br>He was overshadowed by Simpson, yet still featured in some of the club&rsquo;s most momentous games.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s   first ever Euro tie against Valencia in 1962, the 1965 Scottish Cup   Final triumph over Dunfermline, the infamous 1967 away World Club   Championship matches against Racing Club, the victory over Real Madrid   in Alfredo di Stefano&rsquo;s testimonial, the 4-0 thrashing of Rangers in the   1969 Scottish Cup Final.<br><br>Fallon played 184 times for Celtic and kept 61 shutouts. However, he didn&rsquo;t ever feel Stein believed in him.<br><br>The 75-year-old said: &ldquo;I still feel bitterly disappointed by Stein. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be able to forgive him.<br><br>&ldquo;I respect everything he did in football. But his man- management? It was dreadful.<br><br>&ldquo;In my early days as a junior he tried to move me on and I refused to go. I think he held it against me.<br><br>&ldquo;I played in a lot of big games, but I don&rsquo;t think he ever believed in me.<br><br>&ldquo;I reckon he only played me because he had to.<br><br>&ldquo;I   played exceptionally well in di Stefano&rsquo;s testimonial. But after the   game all Stein could say to me was &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re getting f******   paid for&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;Stein stopped me from playing for Scotland and Republic of Ireland. I&rsquo;m sure of that.<br><br>&ldquo;A   well-known journalist from that era, James Sanderson &mdash; someone who was   well connected and close to Stein &mdash; told me a few years after I left  the  club that he hadn&rsquo;t wanted me involved at international level.<br><br>&ldquo;I   felt sick. It was bad enough him making sure that I missed out for   Scotland, but he did the same with Ireland who I qualified for through   my grandfather. I only spoke to Stein once in the 13 years between me   leaving Celtic in 1972 and his passing in 1985.<br><br>&ldquo;He actually BANNED me from Parkhead, or at least from going through the front door.<br><br>&ldquo;After   I left Celtic I went up to the entrance for a night game against Inter   Milan. The doorman stopped me and said bluntly I wasn&rsquo;t welcome, that  he  was acting on orders.<br><br>&ldquo;It must have come from Stein.<br><br>&ldquo;I said to the doorman &lsquo;Tell him he can stuff it&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;A   day or so after I got a call from Stein&rsquo;s secretary to say he wanted  to  see me at the ground. I went up to the park for the agreed time. But  he  never faced me, instead it was Sean Fallon sent out. I thought that   summed up Stein.<br><br>&ldquo;I still went to Celtic games, but it was through the turnstiles.<br><br>&ldquo;It   was only when Billy McNeill became manager six years later that I got   back in through the front door. Billy made me welcome again.<br><br>&ldquo;There   was even an episode when Stein turned up at my house and called me a   bigot. He also said &lsquo;The fans don&rsquo;t want you and I don&rsquo;t want you&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;My wife showed him the door. If he&rsquo;d stayed much longer I would have hit him.&rdquo;<br><br>Through   the years diehard supporter Fallon has watched various Celtic keepers   struggle to avoid criticism, no matter how well they might be playing.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very, very difficult being a Celtic goalkeeper.<br><br>&ldquo;You   can&rsquo;t make one mistake. I met two wee boys recently who never even saw   me play and yet one of them said to me &lsquo;YOU, you sold the jerseys!&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;I came in at 19 years old and played with my heroes &mdash; Bertie Peacock, Bobby Evans, Eric Smith, Neilly Mochan.<br><br>&ldquo;I   felt I was as good as anybody. Thinking about my Celtic career fills  me  with pride &mdash; seven League medals, two Scottish Cup, three League  Cup,  two Glasgow Cup, the European Cup medal.<br><br>&ldquo;I was part of two Treble- winning teams, 1967 and 1969.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s   marvellous being Celtic No 1 when things are going well. But when   you&rsquo;ve blundered and the team&rsquo;s losing it can be hell. There&rsquo;s no hiding   place.<br><br><div>&ldquo;The best I&rsquo;ve seen since I left the club is Artur Boruc.

I think they had taken the &lsquo;cream  puff&rsquo; because  they  got beat. It took a long time, so we just wanted the  meal over with.  They were  told to be there, so they came. They weren&rsquo;t  too happy; they  weren&rsquo;t  talking to anybody. Billy (McNeill) was called  up by the  president or the chairman, and he was handed this brown box,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  your medals.&rdquo; He started with Ronnie, and gave everyone a medal&hellip;  There  was one left, and he went, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; So that was the 12th. I   remember putting it on the table, putting it into the top pocket of  my   blazer. We were sitting talking away, time passed, and Big Jock came    up.&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your medal?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me it.&rdquo;   &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Aw, they forgot one for the referee.&rdquo; I gave him it, and I   got a replacement at the Christmas dance in  Glasgow&hellip; I just looked at   it and said, &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the same medal.&rdquo;I never thought about it, and   it wasn&rsquo;t until somebody said to me,  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a real medal you&rsquo;ve   got.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t have a stamp on it and  it&rsquo;s a different colour&hellip; It&rsquo;s   more of a golden one. The European (medal)  was a red gold. When I   looked at my medal it was shiny. It (the  original) was made in   Switzerland; this one was made in Birmingham. It was a certain director,   who looked after a lot of the players  (Willie Haughey), turned around   and told me the real story &ndash; It went to  Bob Kelly&hellip; It never went to  the  ref.&rdquo;<b><br>John Fallon</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><br><div><b>Post-Note: <br></b></div><div>The medal was finally returned to him in April 2019, deservedly: 52 years after he was first awarded it then had it taken off him.</div><div></div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>John Gets His Medal At Last April 2019 (David Potter)</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>I  think we were all delighted to see that John Fallon got his real medal  at last. Full marks to Mr Lawwell for bringing this about. It put right  an injustice, which some people might even call &ldquo;theft&rdquo;.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div>As  you recall or as you have seen on You Tube if you are not old enough,  circumstances dictated that there was no formal presentation of medals  in that most disorganised of all European Cup finals. They simply could  not cope with the Celtic fans, and Billy was, eventually given the  European Cup without the other 10 men behind him. But wait a bit, that  should be 11 men!</div><div><b><br></b></div><div>John Fallon  technically played in that game. He was wearing his strip under that  tracksuit, and would have taken over if Ronnie Simpson had been injured.  Six months later, incidentally, in Argentina, he had to do just that  after Ronnie was felled by a missile. So Fallon was Celtic&rsquo;s 12th man as  goalkeeper substitutions were allowed in the European Cup of that year.  He also played a great part in ensuring that Helenio Herrera got the  second choice of team bench, he and some other reserves making sure that  they got there first and kept the seat warm for Jock! The game over,  the teams met at the post match banquet. During this time Jock came up  with a box, gave it to Billy McNeil who duly distributed the medals,  including one for John Fallon. OK so far, but then Stein came back and  asked John to give his medal back. Apparently, the Chairman was wanting  it! Yes, the Chairman who, until he admitted he was wrong in 1965 and  brought back Jock Stein, had lead the club to relentless mediocrity, was  wanting a European Cup medal!</div><div><b><br></b></div><div>And as he  was the Chairman, he had to get what he wanted! John was later appeased  when the club arranged to get another medal struck&hellip; but it wasn&rsquo;t the  real medal. So anyway, justice has now been done to John, a man whom you  will see at virtually every Celtic game, home and away. He will  probably be holding court to all and sundry outside the Superstore. He  is not snobby and you will probably hear him before you see him. He will  greet you in his jovial way, he will shake your hand or rather your  hand will sink into his huge goalkeeper hand! He will talk about Celtic  past and present, and as they always say about all ex-Celts, he is just  an ordinary man. His support of the team is by no means uncritical &ndash; he  does not miss anyone and hit the wall &ndash; but it is genuine. His knowledge  of the club is profound, and he now has his European Cup medal. John  Fallon is a great Celt. </div><div>David Potter<b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b><br><div><h3>  John Fallon delighted to be reunited with European Cup medal</h3><br>By: Joe Donnelly on 29 Apr, 2019 20:01<br>http://www.celticfc.net/news/16095<br>SATURDAY&rsquo;S  win over Kilmarnock marked the perfect tribute to Billy McNeill, with  Celtic&rsquo;s current number 5, Jozo Simunovic, netting the game&rsquo;s only goal  on the 67th minute.<br><br>It was an emotional day at Paradise, and  away from the football, John Fallon was delighted to be reunited with  his own European Cup winner&rsquo;s medal.<br><br>Thought to have been lost  after the European Cup final in 1967, John Fallon&rsquo;s medal was discovered  by someone who recognised as it belonging to the Celtic goalkeeper, who  was on the bench in Lisbon.<br><br>The medal was donated back to the club, and the club in turn made sure the medal was returned to its rightful owner. <br><br>Speaking  to Celtic TV, John Fallon said: &ldquo;It feels great to be reunited with my  medal, and I&rsquo;ve got to thank Peter Lawwell and everyone at Celtic for  going to all this effort and finding the medal that was lost. I did get a  replica one at one point, but it didn&rsquo;t seem the same. <br><br>&ldquo;It was  such a surprise, I got a phone call about a month ago from John Clark  telling me that Peter wished to see me. He told me the story of how the  medal had been found, so I was very proud to receive it and it adds to  the collection.&rdquo;<br><br>Looking back, Lisbon Lion John described the  mood at full-time following Celtic&rsquo;s historic 2-1 win over Inter Milan  as berserk, and said he&rsquo;s as proud of that moment today as he was over  50 years ago in Portugal. <br><br>He added: &ldquo;We were wading through  scores of fans to get off the park and into the dressing-rooom. It&rsquo;s  such a great memory! We&rsquo;ll never forget it, and it&rsquo;s something everyone  should be proud. For the Celtic supporters, we gave them something to  look at that nobody else could.&quot;  </div><img align="bottom" alt="Fallon, John - The Celtic Wiki" height="787" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/292efd57ddc353439f3d2878c91f76ba/GW587H787" title="Fallon, John - The Celtic Wiki" width="587"></div><div>Return of the European Cup medal</div><img align="bottom" alt="Fallon, John - The Celtic Wiki" height="339" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/3d0a0cb130868de5f8f36027da4cd0bd/GW509H339" title="Fallon, John - The Celtic Wiki" width="509"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Fallon, John - Pics - The Celtic Wiki" height="524" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/862ccf3419a8d4d140098ceb82690cb9/GW524H524" title="Fallon, John - Pics - The Celtic Wiki" width="524"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Fallon, John - Pics - The Celtic Wiki" height="400" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/812c39c77ab5ada125bdb66c6af5554c/GW589H400" title="Fallon, John - Pics - The Celtic Wiki" width="589"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3><br></h3></div><br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></div></div>
