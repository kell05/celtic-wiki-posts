Class.&quot;<br>Patrick Barclay (sports journalist)<br><br>Brendan Rodgers on post-match huddle &quot;It was just a case of saying remember what  this feels like - that it obviously hurts - but also to remind them  that what they&#39;ve done is incredible.&quot;<br><br>(danbhoy 67 of KDS)<br>First things first, Hearts were far and away the better team and  thoroughly deserved their win . That said, I feel it&#39;s quite correct to  ask a few questions regarding the manner in which we lost the game. Most  of us seem to agree a defeat was coming due to a very obvious dip in  the form of some players who are better than they have been showing  lately . I vividly remember Big Jock answering a reporter when He was  asked what EXCUSE He had for what was a poor performance from Celtic ?   His reply was that never in his life had He looked for excuses, He  always looked for reasons !<br><br>So for what it&#39;s worth here&#39;s my take  on things . First thing to say is the defensive frailties simply have  to be addressed, that I think, would be something the vast majority of  us would agree on . The absolute trouncings we got in the CL section  were obviously in some part due to the quality of opposition but were   still far from acceptable. We&#39;ve just shipped 4 goals to a mid- table  SPL team, lost a two goal lead to Hibs and alarmingly leave the door  open on a regular basis. <br><br>Fatigue ? yes I think it&#39;s a fair  argument . To me some of the players do look jaded . Consider the number  of games played already this season and then add to that the very short  break after what was a long season last time and it&#39;s easy to think it  could be a factor . This brings into sharp focus the importance of the  remaining games to be played in December . Winning them all would make  life a whole lot more pleasant going into the break, dropping more  points would give the teams chasing us a a lift. The break is much  needed .<br><br>Let&#39;s all ditch the complacency and get behind the team to help drive them on to what could be a make or break month . 						 						 						 					<br><br><br>(Peco of KDS)<br>So, 69 games after the journey started, we lost our unbeatable domestic  tag.  Lost in all the hysteria is that we never lost our Invincibles  tag; we never will as that is carved in history.<br><br>Defeat, as  difficult as it is at the time, is inevitable in any sport.  The best  you can hope for is that it doesn&rsquo;t materially impact you.  In terms of  perspective, this was no Fir Park 2005.<br><br>Sure our unbeaten  domestic record has gone and in truly spectacular fashion.  This wasn&rsquo;t  the Hertz robbery of Hampden 2012, cheated out of a cup final place; it  was an absolute pumping from a gastropub team that will almost certainly  never achieve those heights again in their next 69 domestic matches.   The diet Huns will be loving it and, in truth, probably will be their  revenge for 1986.  They will dine out on it for years, in their  parochial and myopic way - I, for one, have no issues with that. It  wouldn&rsquo;t surprise me if their commercial manager was tearing his/her  hair out that they couldn&rsquo;t get a DVD of it released in time for  Christmas.<br><br>We also had the ridiculous situation whereby this  unbeaten run was becoming a heavier weight to carry forward each match.   At the same time, some Celtic fans were conducting a ludicrous vanity  parade, trying to select who or where they would prefer our moment of  failure/abject failure/comeuppance/honest mistake to host our downfall.<br><br>It&rsquo;s  only a matter of historical record that it St.Johnstone were the last  team to meet us domestically.  That one didn&rsquo;t hurt, the one that  mattered previously (when Ronny capitulated to an average, salivating  and rabid Hunnery) changed the course of events and was the catalyst for  change that allowed us to enjoy the best domestic dominance in our  history.  Similarly, today, if you&rsquo;re going to lose, do it and make sure  it hurts.<br><br>We all knew this day was coming.  If it is the  catalyst for change in personnel, 2 weeks ahead of a transfer window,  then I&rsquo;ll accept the defeat.  Sure, the margin and manner of defeat  hurts but sometimes you just can&rsquo;t keep papering over the cracks.

And, with last month&rsquo;s  Betfred Cup final victory over Motherwell, it also saw them capture four successive trophies.<br><br>Rodgers will shrug off the 4-0 towsing at Tynecastle in the same way he dismissed previous hammerings in Europe by Barcelona, Paris St Germain and Bayern Munich. He will attempt to learn what he can from that reverse but he will already be planning for Wednesday&rsquo;s home game against the top tier&rsquo;s bottom club, Partick Thistle, knowing that a victory will restore Celtic&rsquo;s five-point advantage over Aberdeen.<br><br>Indeed, it would be no surprise if, privately, Rodgers is stressing to his squad that they must now construct another lengthy period without losing in the league and the Scottish Cup.<br><br>Those players have, unsurprisingly, looked a little leggy in recent weeks. The match against Hearts was their ninth in 29 days and, with four fixtures still to come before the end of the month, this was always going to be the most likely time for an upset.<br><br>Certain pundits at home and elsewhere will be pleased that Rodgers&rsquo; side have finally been shown to be fallible. There were complaints that their 69-game run was damaging the image of Scottish football, a ridiculous claim and one which also served as an attempt to undermine the magnificence of the achievement. And it was magnificent. For any team in any league in any country in the world to go more than 19 months without bending the knee to their local adversaries is truly remarkable.<br><br>Critics carp about the financial advantages Celtic enjoy over the rest of the top-tier clubs, as if being run properly and making substantial profits is somehow a bad thing (Rangers, for example, continue to run at a loss and have admitted that they will do so until they can compete in the Europa League group stages and no-one appears willing to pinpoint the flaw in that plan).<br><br>In any case, PSG&rsquo;s Qatari oil money makes them the wealthiest club by far in Ligue 1 but  that couldn&rsquo;t prevent them losing to lowly Strasbourg a fortnight ago.<br><br>Bayern Munich occupy the same position in the Bundesliga. They&rsquo;re known as FC Hollywood for a reason but they&rsquo;ve lost to Hoffenheimn and Borussia Munchengladbach this season.<br><br>Celtic have been the richest club in Scotland since the turn of the century but that did not translate itself into invincibility until Rodgers arrived.<br><br>The Irishman is a driven individual and that single-mindedness is reflected in his team. The word the players most often use to describe his attitude is &ldquo;relentless&rdquo; and, without that incessant demand for perfection, they could never have racked up 60 matches without a setback.<br><br>Rodgers was gracious in defeat yesterday but that does not mean it will not have stung him. One imagines that he will be even more determined now to become the first manager to win consecutive trebles.<br><br>The Invincibles are no more but their feat deserves to be celebrated.<br><br><br> <br>Brendan Rodgers: Run will not be repeated in our lifetimes<br>Brendan Rodgers feels the strain during Celtic&#39;s 4-0 defeat by Hearts at Tynecastle.<br>Brendan Rodgers feels the strain during Celtic&#39;s 4-0 defeat by Hearts at Tynecastle.<br>Alan Pattullo<br>Published: 23:20<br>Updated: 23:45 Sunday 17 December 2017<br><br><br>Brendan Rodgers backed his Celtic players to a put together another unbeaten run after the champions fell to their first domestic defeat since May 2016.<br><br>The manager gathered his players in a huddle around him after the shock 4-0 loss to Hearts. Rodgers urged them to press &ldquo;the re-set button&rdquo; and start again, beginning on Wednesday night against Partick Thistle in a rearranged fixture.<br><br>Celtic now have a title race to think about with Aberdeen just two points behind in second place, having played a game more. The teams meet this weekend at Celtic Park.<br><br>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never ever said it&rsquo;s been anything else,&rdquo; said Rodgers. &ldquo;Last year I said, we&rsquo;re not defending a title, we have to win it. We won it last year and will look to go on and win it this year.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic fell just short of reaching 70 domestic games without defeat after Hearts emphatically put an end to the unbeaten sequence, scoring twice in the first half and twice more in the second.<br><br>Highly regarded 16-year-old Harry Cochrane set Hearts on their way with the opening goal, becoming the club&rsquo;s second youngest goalscorer in the process.<br><br>Kyle Lafferty doubled Hearts&rsquo; lead ten minutes before half-time and David Milinkovic scored two goals in the second half, the latter from the penalty spot.<br><br>It is the Tynecastle club&rsquo;s biggest over victory over the visitors since a 5-0 win in 1895 and the first time Celtic have failed to score against Scottish opposition since a 0-0 draw with Dundee in March 2016, under Ronny Deila.<br><br>Rodgers was quick to praise Hearts, who he said were deserved victors.<br><br>&ldquo;It was always going to happen,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I said over many months since I have been here, if the players aren&rsquo;t human then I&rsquo;d say maybe we&rsquo;d never lose.<br><br>&ldquo;But it was always going to happen. It is never nice when it does.&rdquo;<br><br>Rodgers predicted such an unbeaten run won&rsquo;t happen again in his or his players&rsquo; lifetimes, while dismissing those who use it as reason to sneer at the Scottish game.<br><br>&ldquo;He noted it happens in England too, where Manchester City have now won 16 successive league matches.<br><br>&ldquo;It is historical,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think people will look at it in different ways.<br><br>&ldquo;Like people will look at Pep Guardiola&rsquo;s 15 games then all of a sudden there&rsquo;s criticism of that. It&rsquo;s whatever people&rsquo;s perspective is.<br><br>&ldquo;The reality of it is that it&rsquo;s a history-making run. To go undefeated for 69 games, whatever level it is, whatever competition, it&rsquo;s a remarkable achievement.<br><br>&ldquo;The players will go down in history because I don&rsquo;t think it will be done again. Certainly in our lifetimes it won&rsquo;t be done. They can take huge pride in that.<br><br>&ldquo;I wanted to pull them together [at the end] and let them be aware that they were better than us today and  we have to accept that,&rdquo; he added.<br><br>&ldquo;But what you&rsquo;ve done is amazing and they should use this feeling they have not felt for 18 months, use it as a lever really when moving forward and learn from it and be better for it.<br><br>&ldquo;We are a bigger target for what we have done. We have to learn from that and accept  <br><br><br>Tam McManus: Soft centre in defence finally exposed but it will help Celtic<br>Tam McManus<br>Herald columnist<br> <br><br>Well  it has finally happened and boy, was it with a bang. After 69 games and  just over 19 months of domestic domination, Celtic have lost a game.<br><br>Not  quite a crisis just yet for Brendan Rodgers, but he will have learnt an  awful lot from watching his side being battered at Tynecastle.<br><br><br>But  here&rsquo;s a thought. I think losing the unbeaten run will actually prove  to be a blessing in disguise for all concerned at Celtic.<br><br>It has  become like a millstone around the necks of the Celtic players. It has  been more a case in recent months of not getting beaten, and, keeping  the run going, than actually going out and winning.<br><br>They have  lost that bit of freedom and swagger in their play, plus, it will be a  wee bit of a reality check for some of the players who have lost form  but been immune to criticism due to being an Invincible.<br><br>It&rsquo;s not  as if it hasn&rsquo;t been coming either, as just a week before, they came  within inches of losing it on the other side of Edinburgh.<br><br>In  saying all that, they didn&rsquo;t just lose it yesterday, they were  absolutely blown away by a bold and brave Hearts side who went at Celtic  right from the first whistle. On a tight and bumpy Tynecastle pitch,  the Jam Tarts hustled and bullied Celtic into mistakes all over the  pitch.<br><br>If you give good players time and space to play they will  destroy you. Alternatively, if you get in players faces and don&rsquo;t let  them get their heads up, they can look decidedly average. That&rsquo;s exactly  what Hearts did, for 90-plus minutes. They had the courage to press  high up the park as a team and squeezed the life out of Celtic.<br><br>Sure, you risk being opened up and exposed by doing this, but, football is about taking risks sometimes.<br><br>Games  against Celtic have become a bit of a freebie as no one expects them to  lose. The challenge now is to get near that level every week. Huge  credit must go to Craig Levein, a man who has taken loads of criticism  by fans and pundits alike, but who is now slowly but surely turning  Hearts back into a side that is difficult to play against and beat,  especially at Tynecastle.<br><br>I know from personal experience,  opposing Levein&rsquo;s Hearts in the early 2000&rsquo;s, that they could be a tough  nut to crack. He knows what it takes to build successful teams and will  be hoping to kick on and get up the table.<br><br>Not only has it been  Craig&rsquo;s organisation and tactics that have turned Hearts around, but so  has his bravery, throwing in young guys like Harry Cochrane and Anthony  McDonald, a move that has lifted the whole mood around Tynecastle.<br><br>It  has proved to be a masterstroke. Fans love to see young kids coming  through and will show them more patience than maybe some journeyman or  foreign player. In Cochrane and McDonald, they have unearthed a couple  of gems who deserve to be in the team regardless of age.<br><br>That  performance also showed every other team in Scotland the way to get at  Celtic. It&rsquo;s not by sitting back and hoping Celtic have an off day, but  by pressing them up the park and trying to expose Celtic&rsquo;s big weakness,  in central defence. And that was brutally exposed yesterday.<br><br>Looking  at the level that Brendan Rodgers clearly wants to reach, both  domestically and in Europe in the coming years, with this group of  players, the performance of his two first-choice centre backs will have  sent alarm bells ringing.<br><br><br>Celtic have already made moves to  bring in the experienced Marvin Compper and for me, Rodgers needs to  have a clear out in that area. I have never been impressed by Dedryk  Boyata. I don&rsquo;t think he is the answer at the back, defensively.<br><br>Jozo  Simunovic has had injury problems and has at times looked pretty solid.  However, he had a shocker yesterday against Hearts. Is he going to be a  player you can trust in a European environment? I have my doubts.<br><br>Eric  Sviatchenko meanwhile, now looks surplus and certain to leave the club.  Now, if Celtic are serious about moving to that next level, they need  to spend some serious money in this area of the team.<br><br>If they  don&rsquo;t, that soft centre will continue to be exposed against the best  foreign opposition, and as we witnessed yesterday, domestically by any  team focused on matching and beating them all over the pitch.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  BBC<br><br><br>By Brian McLauchlin<br><br>BBC Scotland at Tynecastle<br><br> From the section Scottish Premiership 600 <br><br>Highlights: Heart of Midlothian 4-0 Celtic<br><br>Celtic&#39;s 69-game unbeaten domestic run was ended in emphatic style as they were stunned 4-0 by Hearts in the Scottish Premiership.<br><br>The defeat at Tynecastle is the champions&#39; first domestic loss since a 2-1 reverse at St Johnstone on 11 May 2016 - 585 days ago - and Brendan Rodgers&#39; first as Celtic manager against Scottish opposition.<br><br>The streak began under Rodgers&#39; predecessor Ronny Deila when Motherwell were thrashed 7-0 on the final day of the 2015-16 season.<br><br>In beating St Johnstone 4-0 in early November, Celtic surpassed their own 100-year-old British record of 62 domestic games without defeat.<br><br>Celtic, who Rodgers led to the Scottish Premiership, Scottish Cup and Scottish League treble last season, remain top of the league table by two points, with a game in hand over second-placed Aberdeen.<br><br>Hearts had not scored three or more goals in a league match since a 4-0 thumping of Hamilton Academical in March.<br><br>Craig Levein&#39;s men have conceded just 19 league goals this season, four more than Celtic, who have the best defensive record in Scotland&#39;s top flight.<br><br> Celtic record may never be beaten - Rodgers<br> As it happened: Hearts hammer Celtic to end 69-game run<br> Rodgers&#39; Celtic earn place in the history books<br><br>Celtic&#39;s unbeaten domestic run (all but one under Brendan Rodgers)<br>P 69 W 60 D 9 L 0<br>Scottish Premiership: P 56 W 47 D 9 L 0<br>Goals for 197<br>Clean sheets 38<br><br>Sixteen-year-old Harry Cochrane and former Rangers striker Kyle Lafferty slammed home first-half goals as Hearts dominated the early skirmishes.<br><br>Manuel Milinkovic seized on a dreadful error from Jozo Simunovic to prod in a third early in the second half.<br><br>Celtic piled forward, but it was Hearts who struck again, Milinkovic netting from the penalty spot.<br><br>Rodgers&#39; side may well go onto claim the Premiership title but they were given a football lesson by a dogged and devastating Hearts, who were in no way flattered by the scoreline.<br>Teenager Harry Cochrane lashes in the opening goal for Hearts<br>Harry Cochrane, on just his fifth start for Hearts, thumped in the opening goal after 26 minutes<br><br>The hosts were dynamic and effective from the first whistle, pressing the Celtic defence at every opportunity and denying them the time and space to pass out from the back.<br><br>Centre-back Dedryck Boyata and goalkeeper Craig Gordon were particularly unsettled, with the latter charged down by Don Cowie in his own goalmouth.<br><br>And - after Lafferty, Christophe Berra and Ross Callachan had fired off target - Kieran Tierney&#39;s slip allowed Cowie to pilfer possession on the right wing, and slide the ball inside to Cochrane.<br><br>The teenager, making just his fifth start, took one touch on the 18-yard line before rifling a low left-foot effort beyond Gordon.<br>Manuel Milinkovic scores for Hearts<br>Manuel Milinkovic capitalised on Jozo Simunovic&#39;s mistake to put Hearts three goals ahead<br><br>The Celtic goalkeeper produced a fine reaction save to divert Milinkovic&#39;s volley over the crossbar two minutes later, but it was a temporary reprieve.<br><br>Again, the champions surrendered possession, Milinkovic robbing Callum McGregor and sending Lafferty galloping into open space up the right flank.<br><br>From the angle of the area, the Northern Ireland striker drove his shot across Gordon and into the back of the net via the inside of the post.<br><br>The half-time whistle blew with Celtic, uncharacteristically sloppy on the ball and outfought all over the pitch, trailing 2-0, and the refurbished Tynecastle a raucous cauldron of delirium.<br><br>The visitors&#39; slackness continued after the break, as Simunovic allowed a speculative Connor Randall clearance to bounce over his head and into the path of the gleeful Milinkovic, who rounded Gordon and slotted from close range.<br>Moussa Dembele shows his frustration<br>Rodgers introduced much-vaunted striker Moussa Dembele after the break, but the Frenchman could not find the net<br><br>Under Rodgers, Celtic had never faced a three-goal deficit on domestic duty.
