In his early life in Scotland he combined footballing with earning a  living as a shipyard riveter. On retiring from playing, he moved to  Prague, where his career turned to coaching, training, massage and  physiotherapy work in soccer, ice hockey and tennis. It has also been  claimed that he advised ballet dancers on physical fitness matters.<br><br>  Madden was probably  Baptised at St. Patrick&rsquo;s, Church Street, Dumbarton by Father McDonald  and any formal education he received would have been at the school of  the same name, built adjacent to the above church.<br><br>   As a footballer  Madden represented Scotland four times at full and league international  level. On one of these occasions, versus Wales at Wrexham 1893, he  became one of the few Scots to score four goals in an international  match. Credit for one of these goals is somewhat qualified as Madden&rsquo;s  netbound shot struck off his teammate Taylor. In 1887 and 1892 he  appeared unsuccessfully in Scottish Cup Finals for Dumbarton and Celtic.  However, he had played in Glasgow Celtic&#39;s first ever match in May 1888  and was part of the club&#39;s team squad which won three League  Championships in the 1890s.<br><br>  Madden&rsquo;s active  involvement in senior football spanned a period of at least forty-four  years from 1886 until 1930. His playing career began in Dumbarton with  the town&#39;s minor sides Albion and Hibs. In its edition of October 28  1885 &lsquo;The Scottish Referee&rsquo; commented on the founding of Dumbarton Hibs  as follows. &lsquo;Still another Hibernian F.C! When will the Irishmen and  Catholics of Scotland think of giving their clubs a proper name?  A  meeting of Dumbarton C.Y.M. Society (Catholic Young Men&rsquo;s Society) was  held recently, and a club named the Dumbarton Hibernians duly  constituted and office-bearers elected&rsquo;.<br><br>  Moving on to the  local senior team in 1886 John Madden had short spells with Gainsborough  Trinity, and Grimsby Town. After appearing in Celtic&rsquo;s first ever  match, played in May 1888 he returned to Dumbarton. About a year later  he embarked on an eight year long career with Celtic. Brief stints with  Tottenham Hotspur and Dundee were followed by retirement and seeming  obscurity in 1898.<br><br>   Despite his signing  being briefly registered with the F.A. as a player with Sheffield  Wednesday in season 1892-93, he never got any further than training for  the Yorkshire club. Although uncertain, Madden may have had some family  connection in the Yorkshire area. Accounts of Madden&rsquo;s eventual return  to Celtic, range from simple persuasion on the club&rsquo;s part through  veiled suggestions of threatened physical enforcement by Celtic to dark  references concerning the supposed all pervasive influence of Roman  Catholic priests on the daily lives of their flocks.<br><br>  In his book &lsquo;The  Romance of the Sheffield Wednesday&rsquo;, Richard Sparling described Madden  as being &ldquo;spirited&rdquo; back to Celtic by a Catholic Priest after only  having been in Sheffield for two days.   Sparling also  involved Madden in a tale of the dangers facing English scouts engaged  in recruiting talent in Scotland during in the last decades of the  1800s.<br><br>  These dangers were  apparently most acute in small towns and villages where the arrival of  strangers was immediately noticed. In September 1891, at a time Madden  was a Celtic player, he met up at Partick railway station with a Mr  Dickinson of Sheffield Wednesday and a Mr Wilson rather vaguely  described as being an agent. The party went to Sinclair&rsquo;s public house  in Dumbarton where Madden left the other two, later returning with two  local players Spiers and Towie.<br><br>   According to  Sparling, situated near the railway station, Sinclair&rsquo;s, later to become  The County Restaurant, was apparently known to every footballer in  Scotland. Just as Towie was about to succumb to a bit of smooth talking  on Mr Dickinson&rsquo;s part and sign for Wednesday, the pub door flew open  and in marched some Dumbarton club officials and a number of local  heavies.<br><br>  Cowardice, like  discretion has often been judged the better part of valour. Mr Wilson,  agent, probably having seen it all before, made off with due haste.  Madden and Mr Dickinson, backs to wall, were left to face the &lsquo;music&rsquo;,  which was swelling by the minute as a crowd of some two hundred was now  assembled outside in Church Street. After a few fists were flung and a  few blows landed, Mr Dickinson, mouth and nose bleeding with a pair of  &lsquo;keekers&rsquo; starting to swell, ran for the station with mob in pursuit. By  good fortune he arrived just as a train was about to leave for Glasgow.  <br><br>Apparently there is nothing new in football and, as a terrified Mr  Dickinson collapsed into the train, he found Mr Wilson, agent, sitting  spick and span, apparently having come out of the whole episode smelling  of roses.<br><br>  After a short spell  with Preston North End, Tom Towie returned to Scotland where he found  himself on loan to Celtic from Renton. He appeared to have scored the  only goal of the Scottish Cup final of 1893. However, prior to kick-off,  Ibrox was declared unplayable due to frost and Celtic and Queen&rsquo;s Park  agreed to play a &lsquo;friendly &lsquo;. When the final was played for &lsquo;real&rsquo;,  Queen&rsquo;s were the winners by two goals to one.<br><br>  In 1914, writing in a  newspaper article, his former Celtic colleague, James Blessington,  claimed that the five foot seven, extremely fit Madden was the greatest  five-a-side player Scotland ever produced. Perhaps gilding the lily  somewhat, Blessington wrote that in one season Johnny won dozens of gold  watches and alberts and enough clocks to furnish every room in a  mansion. He is said to have given most of these of these to friends and  relatives as wedding presents. In the same article Blessington repeats  the story of Madden&rsquo;s mother complaining, no doubt with a measure of  motherly pride, of being driven round the bend by &rsquo;the ticking of those  damned clocks&rsquo;. Blessington also mentions a Dumbarton player being  involved with Madden in what appears to have been a fairly prominent  five-a-side team.<br><br>   Among these  five-a-side prizes won by Madden was a pewter tea set which, as part of  an exhibition marking Celtic&rsquo;s Centenary, was displayed in the People&rsquo;s  Palace in 1988. Won at a sports meeting at Celtic Park on Sunday 9th of  August 1891, the tea set was presented to Madden by Mr Dan Crilly, an  Irish MP who was on tour of central Scotland, addressing meetings and  denouncing Charles Stewart Parnell.<br><br>  Between playing for  Dumbarton and settling down to an established career with Celtic, John  Madden put in a stint with Gainsborough Trinity. Writing in The Evening  Times in 1936, using Madden as an example to what he saw as the then  cosseted professional footballers who enjoyed luxuries such as travel on  trains with dining cars, Willie Maley recalled how, Johnny would work  all week at shipyard riveting, travel overnight Friday to England and  return in time for his work on Monday morning.<br><br>    Following his  father&#39;s death in 1885, he and his mother moved from Dumbarton to  Partick, where his sister Agnes was establishing a small group of Fish,  Fruit and Vegetable stores, while her husband Bill Burgess worked in the  shipyards as a river.<br><br>  In early 1905 Johnny  arrived in Prague, where, until 1930 he was actively associated with  the Slavia club of that city. Under his tutelage the club enjoyed  success on a continental scale winning the Mitropa Cup, which was an  amateur forerunner of the European Cup. Madden was a member of the Czech  party at the 1924 Olympics in Paris. It has also been claimed that  members of his Slavia squad made up the bulk of the Czech side that  unsuccessfully contested the World Final with Italy in 1932. With the  final being played in Rome and Mussolini picking the same referee for  both the final and Italy&rsquo;s semi-final, it could reasonably said that the  Czechs were simply on to a loser.<br><br>  Early in his time in  Prague, Johnny married Frantiska Cechova, of Cesky Brod, a suburb of  Prague. The couple had a son known by both the name Harry and its Czech  equivalent, Jindrich. There has been speculation, never confirmed, that  the Madden&rsquo;s also had a daughter.<br><br>  Although formally  retiring in 1930, Madden retained an active role in Slavia&rsquo;s affairs.  Ageing and infirm, he was known to supervise training from a wheelchair,  making his points by wielding a coaching whip According to Willie  Maley, the grateful Czech authorities awarded him a pension for his  services to football.  He remained a British citizen throughout two  World Wars until his death in Prague on April 17th 1948. He is buried in  the Olsany Cemetery, along with his widow who died in November 1963 and  their son Harry who pre-deceased them. On the day of his burial his  body was carried on a bier supported by uniformed pallbearers and  flanked by Slavia players wearing match day strips.<br><br>  Madden, whose  playing career spanned a period of rapid changes both on and off the  field was always there or thereabouts when controversy raised its head.  According to Arthur Jones and Jim McAllister&rsquo;s &lsquo;Sons of the Rock&rsquo;,  Madden caused something of a stir in 1887 when he became the first Roman  Catholic to play for Dumbarton. Any misgivings the &lsquo;Sons&rsquo; fans may have  had on this matter were soon dispelled when, in November 1887, Madden  scored a goal on his debut against the now defunct Third Lanark.<br><br>   In May 1888, John  Madden was a member of the first side ever fielded by Celtic. Later in  the same year he appears to have been scheduled to play in the club&rsquo;s  first ever competition, the Exhibition Cup. Whatever the actual  circumstances, he played instead for Dumbarton. Even Willie Maley, who  ate, breathed and slept Celtic, has given two different versions of what  happened. Maley and Madden had long shared a mutual dislike of each  other and writing in a newspaper series in 1915 Maley claimed that  Madden had deserted Celtic. Twenty three years later in 1938, a more  mellowed Maley, perhaps reflecting that he and Madden were then the only  surviving original Celts, had amended Malden&rsquo;s &lsquo;desertion&rsquo; to that of  being kidnapped.<br><br>   Madden played on New  Year&rsquo;s Day 1892 when Celtic met Dumbarton in a friendly that was to be a  landmark in the histories of the two clubs and the Scottish game in  general. Celtic&rsquo;s defence played out the game, which was kicked off by  Major Burke of the visiting Buffalo Bill Cody&rsquo;s Wild West Show, in front  of a crowd of 15,000 in a spirit of festive generosity. The eight goals  they conceded remains the club&rsquo;s heaviest ever home defeat and a  Dumbarton newspaper claimed that it was the highest score then recorded  in a first class match. The match was also notable for being the first  occasion on which goal nets were used in Scotland.<br><br>   Prior to the open  acknowledgement of their professional status, players of sufficient  talent could enjoy a loose and probably quite profitable arrangement  with a variety of clubs. On the advent up front payment of players,  Madden held meetings in the Elephant Hotel (not to be confused with the  present day Elephant and Castle) in Dumbarton High Street where he  warned fellow players on the dangers of signing what would be binding  and to some degree one sided contacts.<br><br>  Although there has  been some speculation on the matter, it has never been fully established  why, in early 1905, retired from football some seven years, Madden,  probably lacking in any great formal education, took himself off to  Prague.<br><br>   However, at  Tottenham seven years earlier he had played along with an amateur known  as Ernie Payne. Many years later, in 1988, the fortieth anniversary of  Madden&rsquo;s death, the following was attributed to Miloslav Slavik, who has  been described as a dedicated historian of T. J. Slavia. He believed  that Madden was almost certainly introduced to T. J. Slavia by a George  Joseph Payne, a former English footballer who in the early part of the  century was an employee in an agricultural business situated in Lipova  Street Prague. The business trading under the name of PRODUCTIVE was  owned by Frantisek Grob an uncle of Slavik&rsquo;s. At this distance in time  it is difficult to know if Ernie and George Joseph Payne were in fact  one and the same person.<br><br>   Another explanation  of how Madden eventually arrived in Prague is as follows. T. J. Slavia, a  club that had developed from an oratorical society comprised of Czech  nationalist students, was on the lookout for a British coach.  For  whatever reason they had a preference for the Rangers player John Tait  Robertson who like Madden had been born in Dumbarton High Street.  Robertson, who hoped to pursue a career in journalism, had no immediate  interest in Slavia&rsquo;s offer. Madden, always an opportunist, along with  Robertson and another Dumbarton footballer, Findlay Speedie of Rangers,  set out to deceive Slavia. Dressing Madden in a Rangers&rsquo; jersey and  international cap belonging to Speedie and Roberstson, the &lsquo;Rooter&rsquo; was  provided with credentials that made him acceptable to Slavia.<br><br>   Fanciful although  this story may seem, it was later given some credence by Slavia. Around  about 1910 the club issued picture postcards bearing the caption &lsquo;John  Madden Glasgow Rangers&rsquo;. Many years later one of these postcards turned  up in a dealers shop in Florence.  It had apparently been sent by the  club secretary apologising to a member of T. J. Slavia who was disputing  an annual fees arrears demand. These postcards showed Madden wearing a  bowler hat. Apparently up until he died, Madden was always smartly  turned out, wearing distinctively British styled clothing.<br><br>  Whatever doubts  surround how and why Madden went to Prague, not many surround his  reasons for staying there. His marriage to Frantiska Cechova, the births  of a son Harry and possibly a daughter alone, would have been reason  enough for him to remain in Prague for forty three years until his death  in 1948. Material considerations would also have played no small part  in Madden&rsquo;s extended stay in central Europe which included the duration  of two world wars. John Tait Robertson who is said to have played a part  in Madden&rsquo;s appointment with Slavia became the first manager of Chelsea  in 1910. He followed this with jobs coaching the Rapide and MTK clubs  of Vienna and Budapest. Meeting up with Madden in Vienna he was assured  by the &lsquo;Rooter&rsquo; that coaching in Prague was preferable to knocking in  rivets on Clydeside.<br><br>  Whether coming from  football or some other source, Madden certainly seems to have been in  receipt of a very healthy income. It has been noted that he and his wife  were always fashionably dressed and Madden himself favoured British  style clothing. Historian, author and noted Scottish athlete the late  Dr. Iain McPhail of Dumbarton, had been a student a Prague university in  the 1930s. In 1988 he expressed the opinion that Madden&rsquo;s home address  in the Letna district of Prague was in an area of the city where  property prices would have been out with the expected income of a  football coach. When asked to translate Czech language material on  Madden, Dr. McPhail seemed taken aback and said &ldquo;surely Madden was not  the man in Prague&rdquo;. He may simply have been confusing Madden with Johnny  Dick, a Scotsman who had coached Slavia&rsquo;s city rivals Sparta.<br><br>   Oddly enough, Dr  McPhail did not appear to have met fellow Dumbartonian Madden in Prague.  This despite the fact that while he, McPhail lived there, he became  friendly with an Englishman named Calder who had enjoyed more than a  passing acquaintance with Madden. Calder who ran a clothing shop called  English Tailoring had played under Madden for one of three main Prague  clubs. When playing for Slavia, Calder was known by the more Slavonic  sounding name of &lsquo;Less&rsquo;.<br><br>  A persistent, but  unconfirmed story about Madden is that there was a statue erected to his  memory in Prague. Another, and perhaps more plausible version of this  is that the memorial was a wall plaque in the form of &lsquo;hung up&rsquo; football  boots, True or untrue, any such memorial seems to have disappeared by  the time Celtic played Dukla Prague in early 1967.<br><br>  Another unconfirmed  story about Madden was that during World War One, someone from Dumbarton  met him in some kind of detention centre in Austria.<br><br>  Johnny appears to  have had a droll sense of humour. In a series on the life of Willie  Maley, The Weekly News of 20th of June 1936 recounted a Celtic v  Kilmarnock match when Madden&rsquo;s immediate opponent was Bummer Campbell.  On this occasion Bummer&rsquo;s tactics were not at all to Madden&rsquo;s liking. He  complained of hacking, ankle tapping, and other infringements. Bummer  paid no heed. Then Madden walked off the field, returned with a huge  pocketknife, blade open, and handing it to Campbell, asked him to pierce  his heart, as he preferred sudden death to the slow torture, to which  he was being subjected. Campbell apparently saw the funny side and  played out the game in a more sporting fashion.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h2>A Chibouk (Czech Smoking Pipe) on the Pitch</h2>  <h2>(Translated from the Czech by Iain McPhail)</h2>  On Friday, the  fifteenth of April, l988, the fortieth anniversary of his death, a  simple ceremony was held at the grave of John W. Madden, the Scottish  trainer of the Slavia Football Club in the years 1905-30. A delegation  from the branch of the friends of Slavia Club laid wreaths of red and  white carnations, tied with ribbons, on his grave in the Olshansky  cemetery. Taking part in the ceremony of remembrance were the  Vice-president of the OP.; a member of the Vinohrady Theatre; Rud  Jelinek, the President of the Football League. Jiri Epstein, The  Internationalists, Frantisek Planicka, Josef Bican, the captain of the  league team, Lubos Kubik, the Secretary of the 0.P., Vladimir Vacha.<br><br>  Madden, an  outstanding player with Glasgow Celtic and a Scottish Internationalist,  was such a noteworthy figure in Czech football that he has become a  legend. With his cap set at an angle, in a shirt and sleeveless vest,  and particularly with his inevitable chibouk, which was never  laid aside, even in the dressing room, he remains a clear figure in the  memory of the last witnesses of his activities. This so-called &lsquo;average  Scot&rsquo; throughout his whole life, never learned to speak Czech. When he  spoke, he used a mixture of English, Czech and German expressions. In  the eleventh yearbook of Slavia Club in 1928, there is recorded such a  conversation, from which we extract his interesting opinion of our team  at that time.<br><br>  &ldquo;No Czech player  plays well, but the Czech player thinks he is a big man or a big  sportsman. Only a little training, and rather girls and the pub. An old  team is better. Today players, even the Czech, play for the sake of the  game but they play well.&rdquo; &ldquo;We smiled but we understood&rdquo;, emphasised  Prantisek Planicka, Captain of the World cup finalists in 1934, and,  along with Ant. Puc, a survivor of those who trained under &lsquo;Dedek&rsquo;  Madden. They, however, earned his respect. &ldquo;When we stepped out on to  the pitch, all he would say was &ndash; &ldquo;You must play all out&rdquo;. He was  trainer, masseur and doctor. His Scottish &lsquo;jets&rsquo; were renowned. He cured  even torn muscles with these &lsquo;Jets&rsquo;. Once I suffered a similar injury,  and the doctor put my leg in plaster. Madden removed it and I placed my  foot on the bottom of the bathtub, and from a distance of one metre, for  half an hour he discharged a powerful jet of cold water on my foot. It  was Easter and I was frozen. On another occasion, he dealt with a  severely injured ankle of Vanik. We were doubtful about Vanik&#39;s ever  playing again, but Madden gave him his Scottish &lsquo;jets&rsquo; and Vanik  returned to the football pitch.&quot;<br><br>  Joseph Bican also  remembers Madden. I have a good photograph of him; I was introduced to  him before the derby match between Slavia and Sparta. He was an  intelligent bloke, a professional trainer with us, and brought new  methods and experience from England and Scotland. Especially notable was  the fact that in his whole life he learned only enough Czech to enable  him to scold players.&quot;<br><br>  Much has been  written about Madden, but no one has as yet definitely ascertained how  and why he came from Glasgow to Praha and from Celtic to Slavia.  Miloslav Slavik, the dedicated historian of the Slavia Club, who has  also known the Scot personally, is possibly the person who has come  nearest to a solution to the problem. &ldquo;My uncle, Frantisek Grob, had a  business in Lipova Street in Praha, a business concern called  Productive, dealing in agricultural produce. One person who worked in  this firm was an Englishman, George J. Payne, who was also an  international football player. I am ninety per cent sure that this Mr.  Payne recommended Madden to the Slavia Club.<br><br>  Dedek (Old  Man), as he was nicknamed, was 1&middot;7 metres (5 ft 7 ins) tall, had black  hair. in Praha he became acquainted with Frantiska Cechova from Cesky  Brod and married her. They had a son Harry, a born footballer, who,  following an unfortunate love affair, departed prematurely from this  life, a happening which markedly affected Madden. John Madden died in  his 83rd year.   The former Scot sleeps his eternal sleep in the Czech land and, if there is a life hereafter, surely his chibouk will be hovering over a football pitch.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  (The  following   passages  are  translated  from  the  article &ldquo;Legend  of Johnny  Madden&rdquo;, much of which is almost identical with the article &quot;A Chibouk on the pitch.&quot;)<br><br>  Johnny Madden  appeared in the Slavia Club, in February 1905; his entry to the Czech  football scene is commemorated in the book, Czech Lane by the author,  Maxim Boryslavsky. &ldquo;My name is Madden - em, ay, dee, ee, en. I have  definitely had good experience. I know you have talent. We shall surely  be friends.&rdquo; Up to this point he spoke English. &ldquo;Dekuji vam  (Thank you)&rdquo;, he spoke in Czech, but without the hook mark of the grave  accent. (See translator&#39;s note below.) &ldquo;It is all one with whom we have  to fight. If a player smokes, he is no player. But the trainer can  smoke.&rdquo;<br><br>  For the preparation  of footballers, he introduced new ideas quite revolutionary for the  time. Training must be carried out on a level, lined pitch. Every player  has a duty to turn out for training equally well prepared, and even the  laces of his trainers kept tight for a possible pass. Training was to  begin with warming up, short sprints and rapid steps. Madden insisted on  Saturdays and Mondays as &lsquo;no football days&rsquo;  (games were played on  Sundays) but in this he differed from modern practice, every day being  regarded as a training day.<br><br>  Madden&#39;s methods  were, for the period, quite varied and interesting. Often he would  surprise us with some new idea. He maintained that a healthy life-style  was the foundation for training and sport, and he would not tolerate  players who did not like training and tried to dodge it. He called them  &lsquo;Gauners&rsquo; (cheats) and tramps. He would say, &ldquo;Czech players are no good.  The Czech thinks he knows a lot. Only a little training, but girls and  the pub. Czechs like to have a fine time and have no energy for play.&rdquo;  (The last few sentences are in a kind of English.)<br><br>  (The references to  hook-marks in the first paragraph relates to the marks on certain  letters in Czech, e,r,s,z,c, which change the sound and accents on  vowels. Madden was unaware of the difference thus indicated.)   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  The following are  translations of items that appeared in 1994 in a publication entitled  &lsquo;Sparta Slavia Derby&rsquo; and a 1998 Slavia publication entitled FOTBALOV&Yacute; ZPRAVODAJ. <ul><li>&lsquo;Sparta Slavia Derby&rsquo;.</li><br><br><li>MR TRAINER</li><br><br><li>John William Madden was the first foreign coach in Czech F.A.

As a member of the winning team in the day&#39;s five-a-side  tournament, Johnny Madden (who had played in Celtic&#39;s very first match  on 28 May 1888) received a magnificent pewter tea set from Mr Crilly.  Circa 1898, shortly after enjoying a fairly successful and at times  rather controversial playing career with Celtic during which he scored  49 goals in 118 League and Cup matches, Johnny simply upped and vanished  from the football scene.<br><br>In 1905, unannounced, and in  circumstances never fully explained, possessing only a very basic  education and certainly no linguistic skills, Johnny Madden turned-up in  Prague as coach to the football section of the Slavia Sports Club. At  Slavia, he might have found both similarities to, but mainly contrasts  with Celtic&#39;s background. The paramount object of Celtic&#39;s foundation  was to help the Saint Vincent de Paul Society feed the children of  Glasgow&#39;s poorest of the poor. As the bulk of these were Irish or of  direct Irish descent, it was only natural that the club would attract a  variety of people, most subscribing to different strands of Irish  Nationalism.<br><br>In central Europe by contrast, in 1892, student  members of an oratorical society, who shared an interest in Czech  Nationalism, had founded Slavia F.C., whose fans would be drawn from  Prague&#39;s middle-class intelligentsia. Years on, this element of the  club&#39;s support would cause Slavia to incur the displeasure of the Soviet  authorities that controlled Czechoslovakia in the second half of the  20th century. This overt nationalism was to manifest itself well into  the late 1980s when club literature spoke of Slavia in its early years,  &#39;boycotting the so-called Austrian Championship&#39;. There was mention too  of the struggle by various small nationalities to achieve freedom from  the rule of the Austrian Emperor. A far cry all this from trying to  raise money for the St Vincent de Paul!<br><br>In April 1988, on the  40th anniversary of his death, a newspaper tribute to Johnny Madden was  entitled &quot;A Chibouk [Czech smoking pipe] On The Pitch&quot; and made the  following poignantly worded tribute to the ex-Celt: &quot;The former Scot  sleeps his eternal sleep in the Czech land and if there is a life  hereafter, surely his chibouk will be hovering over a football pitch.&quot;  Given that in the course of Slavia&#39;s lifetime Prague has experienced the  upheaval of two World Wars, the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire  and 50 years of subjugation to Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia, it is  difficult to assess to what extent the club&#39;s support has retained any  vestiges of its middle class origins. Johnny Madden, who apparently  learned only enough Czech to scold players he saw as lazy or more  interested in pubs and women than in training, became an instant  success. Under his tutelage, Slavia were soon winning Cups and League  Championships. Arguably, the club&#39;s greatest success was winning the  Mitropa Cup, an amateur forerunner of the European Cup.<br><br>In 1911,  nine of Johnny&#39;s Slavia squad played in the Czech national side that  defeated England to become amateur champions of Europe. In 1924, he was a  member of the Czech squad at the &#39;Chariots of Fire&#39; Olympics in Paris.  Ten years later, eight of his Slavia side played in the World Cup Final  in Rome. The game went to extra time and Czechoslovakia who lost by two  goals to one, were considered very hard done-by indeed. They were  engaged in a lost cause almost from the first whistle. Mussolini was  determined to milk the World Cup for its propaganda value and had  handpicked the same official to referee Italy&#39;s semi-final tie and the  final itself. For further insurance, II Duce personally wined and dined  the hapless whistler on the eve of the final.<br><br>The Madden-driven  revolution of Czech football was no accident. As a player, despite being  something of a barrack-room lawyer in the pavilion, Johnny had always  kept himself at the peak of physical fitness. Over the years (Czech sour<h3>  </h3>ces  tell us) the self-taught Madden trained ballet dancers, tennis and ice  hockey players to be utterly as fit as required in their various  spheres. He was years ahead of his time in matters of physiotherapy and  football psychology. He was fastidious in personal appearance and always  dressed in the latest styles from Britain. He applied the same  meticulousness to coaching and training. He designated rest days between  matches. For routine training sessions, players&#39; boots had to be  properly laced-up, the pitch accurately lined and goal nets hung  whenever possible. Individual training regimes were laid down in writing  for different members of the squad. Oddly enough, Johnny, the fitness  fanatic, thought nothing wrong with standing in the dressing room  issuing pre-match instructions while puffing on his chibouk.<br><br>To  spend a day in Prague&#39;s rambling Olsany cemetery is to take a stroll  through almost 350 years of Czech history. Buried in the Olsany, not too  far from Johnny Madden&#39;s own grave, are the remains of Jan Palach. On  16 January 1969, in Prague&#39;s famous Wenceslas Square, in a protest  against the Russian occupation, Palach, a Czech student, just 20 years  old, doused himself with petrol and lit a match. He died three days  later as a result of his horrifying, self-inflicted burns. Celtic (via  Bob Kelly) added its own footnote to this particular episode in Czech  history by prevailing on EUFA to re-draw the ties in that season&#39;s  European Cup so as to prevent West European sides from having to play in  the Soviet bloc during the Russian military occupation of  Czechoslovakia. Following his death, Jan Palach&#39;s grave rapidly became a  regular rallying-point for Czechs seeking freedom from Russian rule. So  much so, in 1973, the country&#39;s increasingly nervy rulers exhumed his  body, cremated it and re-buried it in the family plot in the town of  Vsetaty, all without the knowledge of Palach&#39;s family. After the fall of  Communism, Palach&#39;s brother Jiri agreed to his ashes being returned to  the OlSany.<br><br>In their respective, widely differing fields of  endeavour, both Johnny Madden and Jan Palach played pivotal roles in  20th century Czech life. Not unnaturally, with the passage of time,  their place in popular consciousness has diminished. Despite this, and  with some regularity, prayers are said at both their graves, candles are  lit and flowers placed on their last resting-places. In Johnny&#39;s case,  Slavia supporters regularly tend the grave and every so often they  repaint the club&#39;s traditional red star emblem (a symbol of &#39;Hope and  Good Mind&#39;) that adorns the gravestone. There is also a trickle of  football fans from Scotland and Ireland who come to pay their own  tribute to a soccer legend.<br><br>Given the continental prominence that  Czech club and national football attained under Johnny Madden&#39;s  guidance, it is perhaps not too fanciful to speculate on what Celtic and  Scottish football in general might have achieved if the game&#39;s  administrators here had possessed the wit and vision to utilise fully  the coaching and training skills of a man who was described in Prague as  being &quot;this average Scot&quot;. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>  <h3>  In search of Johnny Madden, the man who gave Czech football a Scottish accent</h3><h3>  <img align="right" alt="Madden, Johnny - Kerrydale Street" height="240" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/pEljGxeRFpcP4hQpEPMGFw64973/GW152H240" title="Madden, Johnny - Kerrydale Street" width="152"></h3>Hugh MacDonald (The Herald (<a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/more-scottish-football/in-search-of-johnny-madden-the-man-who-gave-czech-football-a-scottish-accent-1.1010507" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>))   <br><br>Published on 2 Mar 2010 <br><br>I AM Madden.<br><br>The  message was blunt, bold and spoken in the tones of someone who had both  endured the rigours of life and been satisfied that he had survived  them. <br><br>Johnny Madden was standing in the dressing room of Slavia  Prague. It was 1905 and the Scot, at 41, was embarking on a career that  would change the face of Czech football and earn himself a substantial  place in the sporting history of a country.<br><br>So who was Madden?<br><br>Born  in Dumbarton, he was the first man to lead a Celtic forward line,  playing in the club&rsquo;s first match against Rangers Swifts in 1888. He won  championship medals with Celtic in 1892 and 1893. He also played in  England with Gainsburgh Trinity. He won two Scottish caps, scoring five  goals in two games against Wales.<br><br>&ldquo;He seemed to disappear for a  while around about 1898,&rdquo; said Tom O&rsquo;Neill, who has researched the life  of his illustrious relative. Madden enjoyed a glorious renaissance after  his playing career ended, however. He became the coach of Slavia  Prague, announcing himself in dramatic fashion in the dressing-room.<br><br>&ldquo;He  laid down the law,&rdquo; said Mr O&rsquo;Neill, sitting in the cafe next to the  Scottish Football Museum. The pensioner, retired from his job in a  distillery, has spent 20 years researching the life of a Scot who gained  glory on a foreign field. But Mr O&rsquo;Neill was introduced to the Madden  phenomenon in subtle fashion. &ldquo;There was a tea set sitting on my  granny&rsquo;s sideboard,&rdquo; said Mr O&rsquo;Neill, also a Son of the Rock. &ldquo;It was  won by Madden in a five-a-side tournament in 1890.&rdquo;<br><br>Madden was  the brother of Mr O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s great grandfather. The silver tea set was a  link to the career of someone who has remained elusive despite years of  research. The coach was with Slavia Prague from 1905 until he retired  from professional football in June 1930, aged 66. Mr O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s research  has thrown up a fascinating sketch of a remarkable character.<br><br>&ldquo;We  do not quite know precisely why Madden went to Prague. But there is an  interesting story about how he may have got the job. It was said that  Slavia were looking for a Rangers player to take on the job. Findlay  Speedie and JT Robertson were Rangers players from Dumbarton. It was  said that they gave Madden some Rangers clothing and they took a  photograph which they sent to Prague.&rdquo;<br><br>The reason for Madden&rsquo;s  urge for Bohemian life is unclear. &ldquo;I thought there might be a woman  there,&rdquo; said Mr O&rsquo;Neill, &ldquo;but there was not. Perhaps he was just looking  for a job and that was the best on offer.&rdquo;<br><br>Certainly, Madden was  aware that there was a harder existence beyond the playing field. His  father was a shipyard labourer and he himself a riveter. &ldquo;He could have  left Scotland just to get out the shipyard. My father worked as a  riveter and he described it as a mixture of brute strength and  ignorance,&rdquo; said Mr O&rsquo;Neill.<br><br>Madden became a figure of legend at  Slavia. &ldquo;He was a bright guy. He was very strict about disciplinary  matters. He was a vacuum cleaner when it came to soaking up  information,&rdquo; said Mr O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;There is evidence that he was coaching  people on the park even when he was playing at 22, 23. He was therefore  one of  the first promoters of tactics. He was a strong believer in  physiotherapy, too. There is some evidence that he worked with ballet  dancers and ice hockey players in Prague too.&rdquo;<br><br>Madden also  accompanied the Czech national squad to the Paris Olympics of 1924. &ldquo;He  had a set of strong beliefs. He was keen on using freezing water to  treat muscle strains.  He also insisted that players were not allowed to  smoke three hours before or after a match or training session. That was  revolutionary then.&rdquo;<br><br>Slavia, the team of the nationalist  intelligentsia, was the leading side in Prague, only diminishing in  importance as Dukla gained prominence under communist rule as it was the  army club. But Madden made a life and a career in Prague. &ldquo;I do not  know how much he immersed himself in the culture but he survived two  wars. The early research indicates that initially, and obviously, he did  not speak much Czech but he must have learned the language. He had to  speak enough of the language to coach across several sporting  disciplines.&rdquo;<br><br>Madden was bright and entrepreneurial. Mr O&rsquo;Neill  has discovered that his relative went to school in Church Street,  Dumbarton, so he was literate. The coach&rsquo;s elder brother, though, could  only sign his name with an X. Another episode in Church Street points to  Madden&rsquo;s reputation as a &ldquo;wheeler-dealer&rdquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;Madden once got in a  fight in a pub there,&rdquo; said Mr O&rsquo;Neill. &ldquo;He was in town with an agent  and it was believed they were there to try to poach two Dumbarton  players.&rdquo; This, of course, was before Madden&rsquo;s life took on its Czech  dimension.<br><br>He became part of the very lore of Slavia. His funeral  cortege in 1948 was accompanied by players dressed in team strips and  flowers are regularly left on the grave of a man who introduced a  Scottish accent to Czech football. He lives on in the club as the Madden  award is seen as the equivalent of a player of the year trophy.<br><br>And  a little bit of his history now resides in the Scottish Football Museum  at Hampden. Mr O&rsquo;Neill has donated the silver tea set on behalf of  Matilda Madden, who has passed on. This piece of memorabilia will be  within touching distance of the Czech squad when they play at Hampden  tonight.<br><br>Mr O&rsquo;Neill has scaled down his research work on his  relative. &ldquo;There are so many records that are missing. It was, of  course, an East European communist regime for so long and many inquiries  over paperwork are just met with: &lsquo;The Nazis burned it&rsquo;. There are  things you are just not going to find out.&rdquo;<br><br>One suspects the enigmatic Madden would have preferred it this way.<br><img align="bottom" alt="John Madden - Death Notice" height="544" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/FBbhzfOn6AVjsbDHf1r9bg323533/GW588H544" title="John Madden - Death  Notice" width="588"><br><h3>  The Sheffield &amp; Rotherham Independent (Sheffield, England), Saturday, August 20, 1892;</h3><br><img align="bottom" alt="Madden, Johnny - Pic" height="333" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/CQOI8FeR1-zVbmsda9vjlA61540/GW521H333" title="Madden, Johnny - Pic" width="521"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Madden, Johnny - Pic" height="192" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/kpfd0gZLad-B8cQRoXLXKg63634/GW666H192" title="Madden, Johnny - Pic" width="666"><br><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Remembering the father of Czech football . . . that corner of a foreign field which is forever Scottish <br></h3></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> June 16, 2015 <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  KEIR RADNEDGE in PRAGUE &mdash;- On the counter of the Fan Shop outside the  Eden Stadium in Prague, amid the scarves and the shirts and the caps, is  a perspex box half full with bank notes and coins of all denominations.  <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  With the UEFA European Under-21 Championship about to open in Prague  the bank notes and coins may soon pile up.

His name was John William Madden and he was coach of the club of the red  star from 1905 until 1930. Madden laid the foundations of the greatest  subsequent decade in Slavia&rsquo;s history when they were six times Czech  champions and once winners of the Mitropa Cup, forerunner of today&rsquo;s  Champions League. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> The last resting place of John William Madden <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Only three times have Slavia won the league title in Czechoslovak and  Czech Republic in the 67 years since Madden&rsquo;s death, in his adopted home  city on the Vltava, on April 17, 1948. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  He is buried in Prague&rsquo;s Olsany cemetery but his grave, like the Slavia  club, has seen better days. Hence the collection in the Slavia Fan  Shop. The management of the club has no time or koruna for tradition but  the fans know better. Madden is a legend, even the &lsquo;Father of Czech  Football.&rsquo; <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> Football pioneers <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> His story is a wild one, characteristic of those football pioneers who strew the people&rsquo;s game across the continent. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Born on June 11, 1865, in Dumbarton, Madden &ndash; variously nicknamed &lsquo;Jake  . . .Old Man . . . Rooted&rsquo; was one of nine children of Irish Catholic  immigrants. By his teens he was working in the Clydeside shipyards and  making a weekend name playing football, even down in England with  Grimsby. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  On May 28, 1888, Madden played centre-forward in Celtic&rsquo;s first-ever  match, a 5-2 win over Rangers. Altogether he scored 49 goals in 118  appearances (38 in 92 league games and 11 in 26 Scottish cup-ties). <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Twice Madden played the the Scottish League and twice for the Scottish  national team. Both matches were against Wales. Madden struck four in an  8-0 win on the first outing in Wrexham in 1893 and scored both Scotland  goals in a 2-2 draw two years later, also in Wrexham. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> With Celtic he was a Scottish champion three times (in 1893, 1894 and 1896) and a cup-winner in 1892. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Sheffield Wednesday wanted to sign him but he stayed in Paradise. The  reasons remains confused. One tale has it that Celtic&rsquo;s  secretary-manager chased after him to Yorkshire with a better offer;  another version claims angry fans threatened Wednesday officials when  they arrived at the train station in Partick; a third version claims he  was persuaded to return to Glasgow by a Catholic priest. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> Comeback <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Madden stayed with Celtic until his retirement in 1897. He made a brief  comeback with Dumbarton then quit again and was briefly  secretary-manager at both Dundee and Tottenham Hotspur. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Eight years later and he was on his way to Prague. Slavia officials had  come to London looking for a new manager. Madden had played in Hungary  on a summer tour and &lsquo;sold&rsquo; himself to them. Asked the reason, years  later, Madden snorted: &ldquo;Well, it beats boiler making in the shipyard.&rdquo; <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  In 1908, three years after his arrival, Slavia won the Czech cup.  Madden was hailed as a magician with his &lsquo;modern methods&rsquo; such as  massages and physiotherapy and a variety of strange, magic ointments. By  then Prague was more than a club, it was his home through marriage to  local girl Franceska Chekhov. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> Stay-away tournament <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Madden managed Slavia until his retirement in June 1930. His last game  in charge was a 3-0 defeat by Hungary&rsquo;s Ujpest Dozsa in Geneva, in a  club tournament organised by countries who had shied away from sending  national teams to the inaugural World Cup in far-away Uruguay. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> He continued helping with the coaching even after being restricted to a wheelchair and until his death in 1948. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  Madden is buried in Prague&rsquo;s Olsany cemetery, near the central railway  station, along with Franceska and their son Henry. The coffin, at his  funeral, was escorted to its final resting place by a guard of honour of  Slavia players in the iconic red-and-white halved jerseys with that red  star on their chests. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">  The condition of the grave is not what it was. Hence the collection box  in Madden&rsquo;s memory in the Slavia Fan Shop, to raise restoration funds. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"> <br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"><font face="Helvetica"> Long gone . . . but not forgotten, in Prague at least.

A snatch from Petr Nos&aacute;lek&#39;s article &#39;BHOY IN BOHEMIA<br> AKA STORY OF CELT WHO REWORKED CZECH FOOTBALL&#39; capturing Johnny Madden&#39;s life after Celtic.<br>https://www.facebook.com/univerzitaslavia/posts/1476844032361602<br> That astonishing, respectful silence is affecting us<br> even though it has been more than one hundred<br> years. The silence has come up one February<br> morning of the year 1905 in a lockers room of<br> football team SK Slavia Prague. The reason for the<br> silence was an arrival of a moustached Scott in his<br> forties who entered the lockers room saying: I AM<br> MADDEN. A new coach of Slavia didn&rsquo;t know a<br> single word in Czech, players didn&rsquo;t speak English,<br> despite this, his first words set up a huge respect of<br> him among the players. Those three words meant<br> more than just a distinctive welcome phrase: as the<br> following 25 years proved, it announced &ldquo;maddens<br> revolution&ldquo;, which was about to change an artificial<br> perception of football in Czech and made it a<br> modern football like in the British islands.  OLDSTER<br>  After Madden ended in Celtic he played in Dundee FC<br> (1897) and Tottenham Hotspur FC (1897-1898).<br> He probably didn&rsquo;t play a single competitive game<br> for these clubs and helped there as a coach or<br> secretary. Great-great son of Madden&rsquo;s brother<br> Tom O&rsquo;Neill who spent some twenty years of his<br> life mapping life of his famous ancestor adds on<br> this that his great-great uncle linked to coaching<br> since his early years: &ldquo;He was a very clever boy<br> who put an emphasis on discipline. When it was<br> possible to gather some fresh information, he was<br> like a hoover. There are evidences that when he<br> was 22 or 23, he was coaching boys in park. He<br> was one of the pilgrims of football tactics.&rdquo;<br> But even Dumbarton native O&rsquo;Neill was not able<br> to find out how Madden lived and what he did in<br> few other years at the turn of the century. Given<br> the fact that he later in Czech showed document<br> of divorced marriage, he probably had a family by<br> that time. It is clear to say that in 1904 Madden<br> travelled with Celtic as a coach to AustrianHungary<br> empire to play two friendly games in<br> Vienna and two in Prague. In the capital of Czech<br> and Moravia the green-whites defeated DFC<br> Prague 3:0 on 23th of May and two days later they<br> defeated Slavia Prague 4:1.<br> Celtic games in Central Europe were negotiated<br> and managed by former English footballer George<br> Joseph Payne who was employed in Czech by<br> an agricultural company based in Prague in the<br> beginning of the 20th century. We will not know if<br> him and Ernie Payne with whom Madden played<br> in Tottenham were the one same person. Agent<br> Payne knew about Maddens troubles in Scotland<br> and he also knew that Slavia would like to fill the<br> vacancy on managerial position with some wellknown<br> British footballer.<br> Prague team send their officials to the Great<br> Britain to negotiate a deal with John Tait<br> Robertson (1877-1935). Defender of Rangers,<br> who as well as Madden was born on High Street<br> in Dumbarton, turned down the offer of Slavia<br> Prague and became a first players and coach<br> acquisition of Chelsea London (coincidentally he<br> was also first goal scorer of &ldquo;The Blues&rdquo;). Jacky<br> Robertson and another player of Rangers who<br> was born in Dumbarton Finlay Speedie (1880-<br> 1953) made a prank on Slavia officials: they<br> took a photograph of Madden in Rangers jersey<br> and Scottish national cup and they sent the<br> photograph to Prague. Madden&rsquo;s arrival to Prague<br> was intermediated by Payne who negotiated first<br> ever professional coach contract in history of<br> SK Slavia Prague. This legend is supported by<br> a postcard that Slavia issued in 1910, there is<br> a Scottish gentleman wearing a bowler hat and<br> sign: &ldquo;John Madden (Glasgow Rangers) &ndash; trainer<br> S.K. Slavia.&rdquo;<br> It is not certainly known what brought Madden to<br> Prague, but it is well known what made him stay<br> in Prague for 43 years until his death. First Slavia<br> coach rented an apartment in Dobrovsk&eacute;ho street<br> 14 at Prague quarter Letn&aacute; and soon started<br> to date a daughter of his landlady Ms Franti&scaron;ka<br> Jindři&scaron;ka Čechov&aacute;. She was employed in nearby<br> laundry and apart the other customers also took<br> care of Slavia jerseys. In the summer of 1906<br> Madden married 17 years younger Franti&scaron;ka and<br> in the January of the following year she gave a<br> birth to their son Jindřich Richard. He was given<br> his second name after his godfather and back<br> then captain and left full back of Slavia Richard<br> Vesel&yacute;. Anyway no one called young Madden<br> differently than Harry.<br> Another reason why Madden stayed in Prague for<br> so long was the economical side of his presence<br> in Slavia. Earlier mentioned John Tait Robertson<br> who after Chelsea (1905-1906) coached<br> Hungarian site MTK Budapest (1911-1913) met<br> &ldquo;Rooter&rdquo; in Vienna who told him that coaching in<br> Prague is better than tighten rivets in Glasgow<br> docks. He made good money in Slavia and his<br> living standard was higher than his youth life in<br> Scotland. Him and his wife would wear the latest<br> fashion and Madden would have a liking to the<br> British style. He would wear a black bowler hat<br> and shining perk coats, always followed by a blue<br> briar smoke.<br> Styled like this he first met Slavia Prague players<br> and had the famous inauguration speech: &ldquo;My<br> name is Madden. I have certain experiences in<br> football and I know you have them too. I am sure<br> that we will be some good friends.&rdquo; And he added<br> in Czech: &ldquo;Dekuji vam (Thank you).&rdquo; He shook his<br> hand with every single player and then he lighted<br> up a short pipe. &ldquo;This will be the only difference<br> between me and you. When a footballer smokes,<br> he is not a footballer any more. A coach can<br> smoke,&rdquo; he explained to the fascinated squad and<br> thanked in Czech again. <br> If any of the players were not sure that this new<br> coach would not make it difficult to them, they<br> were about to make sure in the following days,<br> weeks and months. Back then it was normal that<br> the training sessions were consisted only of ball<br> exercises organized by the captain who also<br> set up the starting line-up. Madden became to<br> introduce athletic and gymnastic exercises into the<br> training sessions. He practised games in blurred<br> view angle and passes and shots with both<br> feet. He demanded a discipline and life regime<br> including the right eating habits, he also time after<br> time went on with random controls in the players<br> homes.<br> Scottish martinet and pedant with highly<br> developed sense of justice was not only perfect<br> coach but also a psychologist and physiotherapist.<br> He healed all the discharges and contusions with<br> his famous &ldquo;Scottish spritzers&rdquo;, soap packs and<br> herbal ointments that he made by himself. He<br> ordered a day off after every game and educated<br> his players by analytics of their games. &ldquo;Oldster&rdquo;<br> had never spoken well Czech, he only knew the<br> basic phrases and he also knew how to chew<br> his players out in Czech. &ldquo;All the players think<br> that they know everything best. They don&rsquo;t train<br> much they just love to hang out with girls and<br> attend pubs. They do everything for fun. I think<br> the players are big rascals,&rdquo; he used to say about<br> Czech players in cute combination of Czech and<br> English language.<br> Slavia under Madden, who was given remits that<br> were not usual that time, started to turn into a<br> giant club in the region. The emergence of the<br> red-whites in Madden&rsquo;s era is best depicted in<br> results that the Prague site had in games with<br> Celtic who as a Celt patriot Madden considered to<br> be the best team of the world. As was mentioned<br> earlier the first game took place in Prague in 1904<br> yet before Madden&rsquo;s arrival and Slavia lost to<br> Celtic 1:4 (in the same year they played Glasgow<br> Rangers too and lost 0:5). Two years later the<br> game with Celtic who was led by former Madden&rsquo;s<br> teammate Will Maley ended up draw 3:3. The<br> Czech press was pleased by the performance of<br> Slavia: &ldquo;Slavia made almost a miracle that they<br> drew with Scottish champions, seeing the Scottish<br> style of football and the style of Slavia, one has to<br> say that the Scottish football is the right role model<br> for Slavia, it fits for Slavia the best. The success<br> of our players is really spectacular and the 29th of<br> May 1906 will be forever noted in Slavia history.&rdquo;<br> When Celtic returned to Prague in 1922 they lost<br> to Slavia 2:3&hellip;<br> Madden earned many league titles with Slavia.<br> He won The Charity Cup four times (1908, 1910,<br> 1911, 1912), back then it was the most popular<br> football competition in Czech lands. In the years<br> 1913 and 1915 Slavia won The Championship of<br> Czech Football Associations and in years 1918<br> and 1924 The Championship of Central Bohemia<br> Division. Both championships were predecessors<br> of The Czech Top League that Slavia won three<br> times under Madden&rsquo;s management (1925, 1929,<br> 1930). Czech national football team benefited<br> from Madden&rsquo;s work in Slavia and the national<br> team triumphed in amateur Europe Cup in French<br> Roubaix under his management in 1911 and nine<br> years later he led the team into the final of the<br> Olympic Games in Antwerp.<br> In the year 1925, Czech football fans celebrated<br> 20 years of Madden&rsquo;s presence in Czech football,<br> Slavia fans thanked him saying: &ldquo;Our dear and<br> honoured John Madden! It has been 20 years<br> since you left your beautiful homeland and you<br> arrived here honoured with the most respected<br> trophies that a footballer can get. You came here<br> to teach us and lead us but very soon you entered<br> our hearts and you became our dear friend<br> respected as a professional sportsman who will<br> be always remembered as a loyal member of our<br> club and also, we respect you as a kind man with<br> strong character and sincere nature, open and<br> honest. It has been twenty years and your hair<br> turned grey, we hope that you have found your<br> new home here and that you found sincere and<br> warm friendship here&hellip; Today after 20 years of<br> your stay here we would like to let you know how<br> much we like you. Your friends.&rdquo;<br> Two years later on All Soul&rsquo;s Day of year 1926 the<br> Madden&rsquo;s family faced a tragedy. Their son Harry,<br> talented striker, who played for Slavia reserves<br> and also sometimes played in the first team in<br> friendlies committed a suicide by jumping under<br> wheels of a train. Probably he was disappointed of<br> an unlucky love.<br> John Madden had managed Slavia footballers<br> for hardly believed 25 years. He quitted his<br> managerial career on 4th of June 1930 when<br> red-whites defeated Sparta 3:2 in the last league<br> round and successfully defended league title from<br> previous year without a loss. During the club&rsquo;s<br> celebration party 65 years old coach Madden<br> stood up and said: &ldquo;I am done. I don&rsquo;t have more<br> to give you.&rdquo; Everyone was shocked but no one<br> could oppose. Slavia players knew that the word<br> of &ldquo;Oldster Madden&rdquo; was worth a rule.<br> During the Madden&rsquo;s era Slavia played 169<br> competitive games, won 134 of them, 12 drew and<br> 23 lost with active score of 717:206. Slavia also<br> played 429 international games with balance of<br> 304-52-73 and active score 1801:655. The best<br> outcome of his work emerged four years later after<br> he retired. The Czech national football team won<br> silver medals on World Cup in Italy in 1934, the<br> final game against home Italy played eight players<br> from Slavia&hellip; <br> &ldquo;Oldster&rdquo; Madden stayed in contact with Slavia<br> the following years. He became an official and<br> worked in several committees. He was a member<br> of &ldquo;Old Slavians&rdquo; which were the predecessors<br> of nowadays Union of Friends of Slavia. He<br> was attending Slavia games until his death but<br> he never stepped into work of his coaching<br> successors. <br> John William Madden passed away on 17th of<br> April 1948. When he was buried in the Ol&scaron;any<br> cemetery in Prague his coffin was followed by<br> his wife who lived 15 more years, the officials of<br> Slavia and a guard of honour that consisted of<br> players dressed in red-white jerseys with star on<br> the chest. Son of the Dumbarton rock and one of<br> the first eleven &ldquo;Bhoys&rdquo; passed away as a loved<br> and honoured &ldquo;Oldster&rdquo; in the land of Bohemia<br> named after Celtic tribe Boii whose name is<br> believed to have origin in the Celt &ldquo;boj&rdquo;.<br> It sounds like an end of a low-budget movie but<br> the Scotsman who played key role in the movie<br> showed sons of Slavia that the origin of the words<br> might not be just a coincidence.<br> 2015 &copy;Petr Nos&aacute;lek</div></div><div><font color="#000000" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font></font><div><h3>  </h3></div></div></div></div></div>
