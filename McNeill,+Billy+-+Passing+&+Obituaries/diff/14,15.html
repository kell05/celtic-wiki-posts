He passed away late last night (Monday, April 22) surrounded by his family and loved ones. He suffered from Dementia for a number of years and fought bravely to the end, showing the strength and fortitude he always has done throughout his life.<br><br>We would also like to note our love and appreciation to our mother, Liz, for the care, devotion and love she gave to our father throughout his illness. No one could have done any more.<br><br><b>Whilst this is a very sad time for all the family and we know our privacy will be respected, our father always made time for the supporters so please tell his stories, sing his songs and help us celebrate his life.</b><br><br><h3>Sir Alex Ferguson: Billy was a giant of Scottish football</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/16065<br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 23 Apr, 2019 11:46<br>Tweet<br><br>SIR Alex Ferguson has paid his own tribute to Billy McNeill, describing the Celtic legend as &lsquo;a truly good man&rsquo;.<br><br>Both men first faced each other as footballers, most notably when Billy captained Celtic and Alex Ferguson was a forward with Rangers.<br><br>Later, they faced each other across the dugout, particularly in the years when Billy managed his beloved Celtic and Alex Ferguson was in charge of Aberdeen, having succeeded Billy at Pittodrie in 1978. At all times there was a healthy rivalry but mutual respect between two giants of the game.<br><br>Speaking today, Sir Alex Ferguson said: &ldquo;I, like everyone in Scotland today, is deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Billy McNeill.<br><br>&ldquo;He was a giant in Scottish Football, a man with an incredible presence and I&#39;ll always cherish the fact that we entered professional football at the same time. We played against each other on many occasions and, as anyone who played against him will testify, he was the fairest of players.<br><br>&ldquo;He was also a truly good man and will be a loss to everyone who knew him. Farewell Cesar.&rdquo;<br><br><br><br><h3>Billy McNeill &ndash; Celtic&rsquo;s Greatest Ever Captain</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/16061<br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 23 Apr, 2019 09:15<br>Tweet<br><br>The Celtic Family is mourning the death of Billy McNeill, the club&rsquo;s greatest ever captain and one of the finest men to have played and managed the Hoops, who has passed away at the age of 79. The wider football family, too, will be in mourning at the loss of this great man.<br><br>Celtic Football Club&rsquo;s deepest condolences and heartfelt prayers go to Billy&rsquo;s wife, Liz, their children, Susan, Paula, Libby, Carol and Martyn, grandchildren and all his many family and friends at this extremely sad time.<br><br>Billy McNeill was a Celtic player, manager and ambassador. First and foremost, however, he was always a Celtic supporter and his love for the club was evident throughout his life.<br><br>He was a one-club man as a player and, for Billy, that club had to be Celtic. He spent 18 years at the club, joining in 1957 and bowing out in 1975. He made his first-team debut on August 23, 1958 in a 2-0 home win over Clyde in the League Cup, while his final appearance came on May 3, 1975 when he captained Celtic to a 2-1 victory over Airdrie in the Scottish Cup final.<br><br>In the intervening years, he made an incredible 790 competitive appearances for his beloved green and white Hoops, more than any other player in Celtic&rsquo;s long and illustrious history. Even more impressive is the fact that not one of those appearances was as a substitute. When Billy McNeill was fit, he played. It was as simple as that.<br><br>He also scored 34 goals, including some vital ones such as the winning goal in the 1965 Scottish Cup final and the winner against Vojvodina in 1967 that put Celtic into the semi-final of the European Cup.<br><br>The man known simply as &lsquo;Cesar&rsquo; captained the team during the golden era of the late 1960s and early &lsquo;70s under the stewardship of Jock Stein, winning nine league titles in a row, seven Scottish Cups and six League Cups. He also cemented his place as a Celtic legend on May 25, 1967 when he held aloft the European Cup in Lisbon&rsquo;s Estadio Nacional after leading the team to a 2-1 victory over Inter Milan. He also reached another European Cup final in 1970, as well as two semi-finals in 1972 and &rsquo;74.<br><br>When he did finally hang up his boots, it was as a cup winner, leading Celtic to yet another Scottish Cup triumph in 1975. He held aloft the trophy, as he did so often throughout his career, before his Celtic team-mates held him aloft on the pitch, acknowledging his greatness and the debt that Celtic Football Club owed to him.<br><br>His association with Celtic did not end there, however, and he returned as manager in 1978 after short spells with Clyde and Aberdeen, with his friend and fellow Lisbon Lion, John Clark, joining him in the dugout as his assistant. And in that first season, they led Celtic to one of the most memorable championship wins in the club&rsquo;s history, when the title was secured with a 4-2 win over Rangers that will be forever known as the night &rsquo;10 men won the league.&rsquo;<br><br>Billy&rsquo;s Celtic team went on to win the Scottish Cup the following season and then back-to-back titles in 1981 and &rsquo;82. He left Celtic in 1983, and managed both Manchester City and then Aston Villa before returning to Paradise in 1987 for the start of the club&rsquo;s Centenary season, guiding the Hoops to a memorable league and Scottish Cup double.<br><br>That Celtic team epitomised the best traditions of Celtic and embodied the character of Billy McNeill &ndash; always wanting to play football &lsquo;the Celtic Way&rsquo;, with enormous pride in the green and white Hoops and with an incredible desire to win and never give up that saw many last-gasp victories achieved when other clubs might have given up.<br><br>The season following the Centenary Double, Celtic retained the Scottish Cup with a 1-0 win over Rangers in the final.<br><br>In 1991, Billy left Celtic again, but remained a regular and extremely popular figure at Celtic Park, particularly on a matchday. In 2009, he became a club ambassador, while six years later, in December 2015, a magnificent statue of Cesar holding aloft the European Cup was erected at the front of the Celtic Way, ready to greet all visitors to Billy&rsquo;s beloved Celtic Park.<br><br>Like all of his fellow Lisbon Lions, Billy remained a humble man despite the extraordinary success he achieved in football, once saying, &lsquo;I have been fortunate enough to have served the club as a player, captain and manager, and I enjoyed every experience I had at Celtic Park, I enjoyed everything.&rsquo;<br><br>The Celtic supporters, of course, in idolising one of their own, were the fortunate ones to have seen Billy McNeill play and manage the club that they, and he, always loved.<br><br>Rest in Peace, Cesar. You&rsquo;ll Never Walk Alone.<br><br><br><h3>Scott Brown: Billy set the benchmark for every Celtic captain</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/16064<br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 23 Apr, 2019 10:15<br>Tweet<br><br>SCOTT Brown spoke of the sadness within the Celtic squad at the news of Billy McNeill&rsquo;s passing, and he also described the honour he feels in following in the footsteps of Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever captain.<br><br>The current Celtic captain said: &ldquo;Wearing the captain&rsquo;s armband at Celtic is a great honour and privilege and it&rsquo;s something that I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to have done over the past few years. However, there will only be one greatest ever Celtic captain and that is Billy McNeill.<br><br>&quot;All of the players at the club are deeply saddened to hear of Billy&rsquo;s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends at this time.<br><br>&quot;Billy set the benchmark as a Celtic player and captain, and that&rsquo;s something everyone who pulls on the jersey has to aspire to. He won every honour in the game with Celtic including, of course, the European Cup, and I can only imagine how he must have felt when he lifted that trophy in Lisbon back in 1967.<br><br>&quot;He and his team-mates created history with their success, both in Scotland and in Europe, and every successive Celtic team since then have always strived to emulate that. It is only right that at a massive club like Celtic we have the highest targets to try and achieve, and those were set by Billy McNeill and that team who achieved such incredible things.<br><br>&quot;It was also great to see Billy here on a matchday when he would come to Celtic Park to cheer on the team, and it was always good to know that, even after they retired, legends such as Billy and his team-mates from that era, were still cheering on the team as supporters.<br><br>&quot;John Clark has always been an integral part of things here at the club, and I know this will be a tough time for him and his fellow Lisbon Lions. You can see that the bond they had as players has remained throughout the rest of their lives, and our thoughts are with them too.<br><br>&quot;I also know that Celtic supporters throughout the world will be devastated at this news. Billy McNeill has been a hero to every fan, and it is fitting that his statue is the first thing that greets us all at the start of The Celtic Way. He will always be remembered as a true Celtic legend and one of our greatest ever players.&rdquo;<br>ad  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>  Billy McNeill, captain of Celtic&#39;s European Cup-winning team, dies aged 79</h3><br> &lsquo;Lisbon Lion&rsquo; was first British player to lift European Cup in 1967<br> Managed Celtic in two spells and played 29 times for Scotland<br>https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/23/billy-mcneill-captain-of-celtics-european-cup-winning-team-dies-aged-79<br>Guardian sport<br><br>Tue 23 Apr 2019 09.19 BST<br>Last modified on Tue 23 Apr 2019 09.54 BST<br><br>Shares<br>118<br>Billy McNeill with the European Cup in 1967 in Lisbon, after Celtic&rsquo;s victory over Internazionale in the final.<br>Billy McNeill with the European Cup in 1967 in Lisbon, after Celtic&rsquo;s victory over Internazionale in the final.

He passed away late last night (Monday 22 April) surrounded by his family and loved ones. He suffered from dementia for a number of years and fought bravely to the end, showing the strength and fortitude he always has done throughout his life.<br><br>&ldquo;We would also like to note our love and appreciation to our mother, Liz, for the care, devotion and love she gave to our father throughout his illness. No one could have done any more. Whilst this is a very sad time for all the family and we know our privacy will be respected, our father always made time for the supporters so please tell his stories, sing his songs and help us celebrate his life.&rdquo;<br><br>As captain of Stein&rsquo;s all-conquering Celtic side, McNeill won nine league titles in a row, seven Scottish Cups and six League Cups. He retired in 1975 after winning his final trophy, the Scottish Cup, and retained a strong association with the club throughout the rest of his life, becoming an ambassador in 2009. Six years later a statue of McNeill holding aloft the European Cup was erected outside Celtic Park.<br><br> Celtic Football Club (@CelticFC)<br><br> Rest in peace, Cesar.

His autobiography, Hail Cesar, was about to be published.<br><br>Billy&#39;s 65th birthday might have been a matter of six months away, but I remember that he still cut an impressive figure. &quot;That&#39;s Billy McNeill!&quot; one man whispered to his wife as Cesar walked past their table.<br><br>READ MORE: Celtic legend Billy McNeil dies aged 79 <br><br>Billy was walking with a limp. He said he had promised himself that he would eventually have an operation to deal with it. He was not a stranger to hospitals: he had open-heart surgery in 1997, but within a few days he was jogging around the hospital corridors, causing papers to blow off the desks as he passed.<br><br>Over the next 40 minutes or so - I wish we could say one of us had ordered Caesar salad for lunch, but I&#39;d be lying - the former Celtic captain and manager spoke of many things.<br><br>That nickname, for example - &quot;I&#39;ve read all sorts of rubbish about Julius Caesar, about my being an imperious sort of player. It came from 1960 when a gang of us went to see the Ocean&#39;s Eleven film. One of its stars was Cesar Romero.<br><br>As I was the only one with a car, one of the guys decided I suited the Romero role, and that&#39;s how the name stuck.&quot;<br><br>I asked him about players&#39; wages - the top English players back then seemed to receive colossal amounts of money. <br>&quot;You often see criticism of these guys&#39; salaries, but there are so many professions nowadays in which people are indecently paid, and I honestly don&#39;t think footballers are bad in comparison,&quot; he said. &quot;Some people are paid a million pounds to read the news on TV.<br><br>&quot;Footballers are different. They are stars in their own right, and give people enormous entertainment.

We saw very little of the income that the club raked in.&quot;<br><br>He praised Jock Stein, Celtic&#39;s legendary manager: &quot;Big Jock was ahead of his time in so many ways,&quot; says Billy. &quot;He revolutionised Celtic, and maybe Scottish football as well. If it hadn&#39;t been for him, the Celtic of today would not exist.&quot;<br><br>His career highlight, of course, had occurred on May 25, 1967. Lisbon&#39;s Estadio Nacional: the European Cup final.

There&#39;s a famous photograph of McNeill, still his mid-twenties, triumphantly holding the trophy aloft.<br><br>&quot;If I could turn back the clock, it would be to have all the Lions collect the cup that night, not just me,&quot; he said now. &quot;When the fans invaded the pitch to celebrate, the team was shepherded into the dressing room. That left just me and assistant manager Sean Fallon to be presented with the cup, to my dismay.<br><br>&quot;Winning it wasn&#39;t a personal thing. It was a collective thing. That victory was the biggest thing I&#39;ve ever achieved, but it was only much later before we appreciated just how big it was. Even today, fans talk to you about it, and you realise that Lisbon has passed into folklore.&quot;<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s terrific,&quot; he added, &quot;that people still point you out and tell their kids &#39;See that man there ...?&#39; I don&#39;t know how often a wee boy has looked at me and wondered who this old man was. But then their parents mention the European Cup, and you become a Lisbon Lion all over again.&quot;<br><br>We spoke about his ventures into management - Clyde, Aberdeen, Celtic, Manchester City, Aston Villa, Celtic again. Not every spell ended as happily as he would have wished, but in Scotland at least there were lots of honours: four Scottish League championships, three Scottish Cups, one Scottish League Cup.<br><br>Despite all the adulation and the triumphs he achieved as a player, he said he had been careful never to take too much of it home.<br><br>&quot;At home, I&#39;ve never been &#39;Billy McNeill the footballer&#39;. I always aimed to be just &#39;Billy McNeill, a father to my kids&#39;. And today I&#39;m just a grandfather to my six grandchildren, not a legend.&quot;<br><br>I&#39;d been slightly apprehensive, beforehand, about meeting Cesar. This, after all, was a man who had seen it all and done it all, who had in his time been adored unconditionally by thousands upon thousands of Celtic fans, and who had a lifetime&#39;s experience of dealing with the media.<br><br>It was also clear that he carried with him a sort of natural authority. No wonder so many players looked up to him - and to him.<br><br>In the event, I needn&#39;t have worried. He couldn&#39;t have been friendlier.<br><br>The conversation went well but, all too soon, it was over. And as we prepared to leave, the diner who&#39;d exclaimed &quot;It&#39;s Billy McNeill!&quot; who still casting glances in his direction.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>  Lisbon Lion John Clark: Billy was such a big part of my life</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/16067<br>By: Tony Connelly on 23 Apr, 2019 13:31<br>Tweet<br><br>JOHN Clark described Billy McNeill as an &lsquo;icon of football&rsquo; and a &lsquo;massive personality&rsquo; as he paid tribute to his friend and former Lisbon Lions team-mate who sadly passed away late last night (Monday, April 22).<br><br>Celtic legend, Billy McNeill, passed away at the age of 79 after battling dementia for many years. He leaves behind a legacy unlike any other, and tributes for the man fondly known as Cesar have begun pouring in from throughout the footballing world.<br><br>In paying tribute to Billy, John Clark said he was deeply saddened at losing a dear friend and described his former team-mate as a giant of the game.<br><br>&ldquo;My thoughts are with Liz, his children and his grandchildren,&rdquo; said Clark. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s obviously very sad and I hope they are okay. Jim Craig called me this morning to tell me the news and, even though I knew he wasn&rsquo;t well, it still stuns you when you find out.<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known Billy for most of my life. We played together and spent most of our lives working together, about 60-odd years in total. I can&rsquo;t imagine a time in my life then without him.<br><br>&ldquo;There were no big egos in that team we were part of and Billy summed that up. He was down to earth and everyone in the team was as well. Billy was well-liked, and everyone who met him liked him because of the kind of person he was.<br><br>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing much more you could say to some him up other than he was an icon in football. He was well-respected by everyone and he respected other people as well. He&rsquo;ll be a big miss. That&rsquo;s part of my life away now. He was a massive personality. He was big in stature and big in personality and we&rsquo;ll all miss him very much.&rdquo;<br><br>John Clark arrived at Paradise in 1958, one year after Billy signed for Celtic, and the pair played in the Hoops together for 13 years. They achieved unprecedented success along the way and became immortalised as the Lisbon Lions after crowning achievement of winning the European Cup in 1967.<br><br>The two men first met as teenagers and went on to form a bond that would that would last a lifetime but their work together did not cease once they retired from playing. They partnered up in management and brought more success to Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;I played with him and managed with him at Aberdeen and Celtic,&rdquo; said John Clark. &ldquo;I always knew Billy would be a good manager because he was determined enough to be successful and he was successful.<br><br>&ldquo;He never let things get to him in a way some managers would have and that was down to the character he was. He could handle the pressure well and he did as a player and a manager.&rdquo;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  We won&rsquo;t see the like of Billy McNeill again<br>Alex Massie<br></h3>  We won&rsquo;t see the like of Billy McNeill again<br>Alex Massie<br>https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/04/we-wont-see-the-like-of-billy-mcneill-again/<br>23 April 2019<br><br>2:59 PM<br><br>Certain deaths unavoidably feel like the closing of an era, the final confirmation that what has been and gone can never return. One such is the passing of Billy McNeill, whose death, at the age of 79, was announced this morning. The Celtic captain, skipper of not just that club&rsquo;s greatest side but of the finest team that ever emerged from Scotland; the only Scottish team to win the european cup and the first British side to do so, was one of a kind.<br><br>All football clubs cherish their heritage but few more devoutly than Celtic. If the club&rsquo;s penchant for underdog status sits oddly with its remarkable record of achievement &ndash; Celtic will soon win the Scottish championship for a fiftieth time &ndash; it still reflects something real. This has not just been a football club, it has been a family. A movement for Catholic Scots and Scots of Irish descent that for generations has understood itself as the outsiders, forever considered somehow suspect or not quite the thing by a Scottish establishment whose colours, especially in Glasgow, were the royal blue of Rangers, not the green and white of Celtic. There was enough truth in this for it to matter, even if &ndash; especially when viewed from outwith the Old Firm duopoly &ndash; the distinction has always seemed one of degree not kind.<br><br>But of McNeill it may reasonably be said we shall not see his like again. As the obituaries remind us, he was nicknamed Cesar after the actor Cesar Romero on the account of his looks but the public preferred to think of him as &ldquo;Caesar&rdquo;, a sobriquet better fitting his imperial demeanour at the heart of an all-conquering Celtic XI that won nine consecutive Scottish league titles. Indeed, in the course of a career amounting to 800 or so games in the hoops, McNeill gathered a personal haul of 31 trophies.<br><br>Football has changed since those black-and-white days and often for the better. But even progress and improvement come at a cost. The commercialisation of the sport, both made possible by and dependent on the globalised commodification of entertainment, has made elite football a wholly different game to that played by McNeill.<br><br>This season&rsquo;s Champions League has proven unusually interesting. The progress of Tottenham Hotspur and Ajax to the semi-finals has offered a refreshing alternative to the cast of suspects commonly present at the sharp end of european football&rsquo;s flagship competition.<br><br>Satisfying as this has been, some perspective is required. According to Forbes magazine&rsquo;s latest analysis, Tottenham is the tenth most valuable club on the planet. As also-rans go, they run pretty far and pretty fast. Ajax, meanwhile, provide a more interesting case. That a club which has won the tournament four times can be considered plucky, impoverished underdogs tells you everything it is necessary to know about how european football has, at the highest level, become a closed shop entrance to which is denied to all but a gilded few. And, in this context, Ajax really are plucky, impoverished underdogs. So much so in fact that anyone possessing even an ounce or two of romance must keenly hope they lift the trophy for a fifth time. It would be a more remarkable achievement than any previously enjoyed by one of europe&rsquo;s greatest clubs.<br><br>As everyone knows &ndash; and, yes, as some are tired of hearing &ndash; every member of the side McNeil led to glory in Lisbon was born and brought up within 30 miles of Celtic Park. That was remarkable even fifty years ago; it would be simply impossible now and not just because the seams of talent to be mined in Glasgow and Lanarkshire were deeper then.<br><br>That gave McNeill&rsquo;s side a rare distinction that has proved imperishable, adding lustre to a legend that would have more than sufficed even without that quality. These were the Glasgow boys that took on, and beat, a continent. On that hot Lisbon afternoon in the summer of 1967 Internazionale of Milan were confident they&rsquo;d win the european cup for a third time. They reckoned without Jock Stein&rsquo;s men; they reckoned without the Lions of Lisbon.<br><br>And it was not just Celtic&rsquo;s status as underdogs that won so many admirers then; it was also their commitment to attacking football. There is a peculiar beauty to the catenaccio style preferred, indeed mastered, by Helenio Herrera&rsquo;s Inter team but it is one for a particular type of purist. To put it differently, if everyone played like that football would be a diminished spectacle. Celtic, by contrast and in keeping with the club&rsquo;s idea of its own traditions, were an attacking phenomenon. They ran Inter off their feet and Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; winner, struck with just five minutes left on the clock, was both a long time coming and seemingly inevitable. It was also a blow for a particular idea of what football should be.<br><br>As Bill Shankly, whose Liverpool side had been demolished by Ajax earlier in the competition, told Stein, &ldquo;John, you&rsquo;re immortal now&rdquo;. All true and a status by no means confined to the manager. McNeill, who captained the club for a dozen seasons, was rendered immortal that day too. Scottish football has not seen the like of that team, which reached another final and a brace of semi-finals too, again. Nor, indeed, has British football while on the continent perhaps the homegrown Ajax side which triumphed in 1995 comes closest to equalling Celtic&rsquo;s achievement.<br><br>That Ajax side disappeared overnight, however, plucked clean by richer clubs in Italy, Spain, and England. This year&rsquo;s underdogs from Amsterdam will suffer the same fate; enjoy their presence together while you can for it will not, cannot, last for long.<br><br>In 1967 Celtic defeated the champions of Switzerland, France, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Italy. On a given day, the randomness essential to knock-out competition could have sunk the Scots&rsquo; chances. That randomness &ndash; upon which sport depends more than the people who run sport allow &ndash; would in time prove too much for european football&rsquo;s guardians. The Champions League is not just about making money &ndash; though of course it is largely about that &ndash; it is about making sure that money is shared between a select, unchanging, few. Randomness is the enemy because business plans demand predictable income streams.<br><br>So, even as we marvel as Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo or whomever else, we know, deep down, modern football has privileged spectacle at the expense of poetry. There can be no room for the unknown, the new, the surprising. It makes for a great show but one whose rewards are subject to the law of diminishing returns. It is magnificent in its way, but it is not sport. It is a commodity that knows the price of everything but the value of rather less.<br><br>The idea a team from Scotland could become champions of europe now is palpably absurd. But then the notion clubs such as Red Star Belgrade or Steaua Bucharest could do so once again is equally absurd. This century, only Porto have challenged the plutocratic elite and that too was a one-off whose reoccurrence seems less probable year by year. The money doesn&rsquo;t allow for it.<br><br>Sport requires competition, otherwise it is only spectacle. The field has never been truly level but it was once level enough for surprise and wonder. Removing that, stripping sport of its randomness, impoverishes it even as it enriches those protected from upsets.<br><br>In that sense, the death of Billy McNeill is the end of one world. McNeill was the leonine symbol of that great Celtic era; the Caesar of a team that conquered all worlds available to it. Something precious has been lost since then and not just in Scotland either.<br><br><br>Billy McNeill &ndash; Emotional Tributes from 3 Lisbon Lions teammates<br>By Editor 23 April, 2019 No Comments<br>https://thecelticstar.com/billy-mcneill-emotional-tributes-from-3-lisbon-lions-teammates/+<br><br>&ldquo;It is very sad news,&rdquo; Jim Craig said. &ldquo;Billy was such a nice guy, easy to get on with and that&rsquo;s all you can ask from someone.

I was the captain of the Scottish schoolboys team in 1961 for a game against England, which was the only international match we played at that time at Under-18 level.

And he had worked with Jock Stein before when Jock was there at Celtic in the earlier days with the reserves.

Photograph: AP<br><br>The dais on which the trophy was presented stood on the opposite side of the stadium to the dressing-rooms, and in the chaos that followed the final whistle McNeill was separated from his team-mates and had to lift the trophy alone. He later reflected that his only disappointment in the whole experience was that they were not alongside him to share the moment. However, they stuck together as a team of close friends for the rest of their lives, inextricably linked by an extraordinary shared experience.<br>&#39;Lisbon Lion&#39; Billy McNeill &ndash; a life in pictures<br><br>As captain of the Lisbon Lions, McNeill held a unique place in the affections of Celtic supporters for more than half a century. His intelligence, articulacy and leadership qualities all enhanced the image of an exceptional sportsman and role model. His entire club career of more than 800 games was in Celtic colours.<br><br>Early in his Celtic career, McNeill, the only one of his group who owned a car, acquired the nickname &ldquo;Cesar&rdquo;, in deference to Cesar Romero, the getaway driver in Ocean&rsquo;s 11. As the years went on, the spelling had to be adapted since the name would have been more appropriate to McNeill&rsquo;s imperious bearing, acquired from his Dundonian father, Jimmy, who was an army PE instructor.<br><br>McNeill was born in Bellshill, Lanarkshire. His mother Nellie&rsquo;s parents were Lithuanian immigrants, and in his early childhood the extended family lived in their miners&rsquo; row cottage. When he was nine, his father was posted to Hereford, where Billy attended a rugby-playing school and showed promise as a winger. Returning to Scotland took him back to football, and he completed his schooling at Our Lady&rsquo;s high school in Motherwell, breeding ground of many fine players.<br><br>In 1957, Stein, then Celtic&rsquo;s youth coach, saw him play for Scotland schoolboys against England and immediately sought his signature. McNeill recalled Stein asking his mother: &ldquo;If he steps out of line, is it OK if I give him a skelp?&rdquo;<br><br>Mrs McNeill readily agreed and the deal was done. Billy, who was academically able, regretted not going to university but could not refuse the lure of Celtic. He received an honorary degree from Glasgow University in 2008.<br><br>The early 1960s was a grim period in Celtic&rsquo;s fortunes. While they had promising young players, the club&rsquo;s management structure was archaic, with all power lying in the hands of the chair, Bob Kelly. Stein left in 1961 to become manager of Dunfermline Athletic, and by 1965 McNeill was on the verge of seeking a transfer &ndash; when his mentor returned to Celtic with immediate and devastating effect.<br>Guardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you<br>Read more<br><br>They won the first available trophy, the Scottish Cup, and set off on a run of nine successive league titles (there would also be six more Scottish Cups and six Scottish League Cups). The team was built around McNeill in the centre of defence, where he developed what he described as a &ldquo;telepathic understanding&rdquo; with John Clark, who occupied the sweeper&rsquo;s role. It was a classic partnership in a team generally dedicated to stylish, attacking football. McNeill also went on to win 29 Scottish caps, usually with Clark alongside him.<br><br>When McNeill finished playing in 1975, he intended to pursue a business career. However, an investment of the modest savings which football had yielded, in property and hotels, proved disastrous. He turned to management, briefly with Clyde, then, very happily, with Aberdeen, for whom he laid the foundations of future success under Alex Ferguson. However, he answered the call to become Celtic manager in 1978 on Stein&rsquo;s departure.<br><br>This proved a difficult experience. In five seasons, McNeill led the club to three league titles but, frustrated by lack of resources to buy players, eventually concluded that &ldquo;loyalty was a one-way street&rdquo;. He left to manage Manchester City, who had just been relegated from the old First Division, and in his second season McNeill led them back into the top flight.

He gave us hope and a lot of great memories in my late teens and  early twenties and I&#39;d like to pay tribute to him here if I may.<br> <br> Billy McNeill was a colossus. A great man who was the first British  footballer to lift the European Champions Cup as captain of the Lisbon  Lions. A legendary centre half and often known as Caesar, he played his  entire career for Celtic, he captained them to 9 straight titles, 7  Scottish Cups, and 6 League Cups.<br> <br> He managed Aberdeen where his team finished runners up in the League and  Scottish Cup, lahying the foundations of a great side. He was most  successful as a manager at Celtic twice, winning 4 Scottish League  titles and 3 Scottish Cups and a League Cup.<br> <br> In between those spells, is where he came into our lives at Manchester City.<br> <br> In debt to the tune of a crippling &pound;4m after our long tumble to  relegation in 1982-83, with morale at rock bottom, talent limited and  discipline questionable, City needed a strong, resourceful manager, and  we were lucky to acquire the services of Billy McNeill. Lord knows why  he came, given our poverty, not only in terms of money but the lack of  judgement in the City boardroom.<br> <br> One decision that the board got right was hiring Billy McNeill who  quickly set about rebuilding with mainly bargain basement Scottish  players. Jim Tolmie arrived from Lokeren for &pound;30,000, creating and  scoring goals early on and free transfer Derek Parlane went on to be top  scorer in 1983-84 Neil McNab from Brighton for &pound;35,000 was to give 6  years sterling service. McNeill quickly turned round morale, and his  team started off brightly with a 2-0 win at Palace. McNeill gave us hope  again. He got the most out of his players, with skipper Paul Power at  the helm, and youngsters like Andy May, making sure the players played  with passion. City competed strongly for promotion in the first half of  the season, showing the character to battle (there were a few scratchy  2-1 wins) and we even borrowed from KC &amp; the Sunshine band and sang  &ldquo;City&rsquo;s going up, going up, City&rsquo;s going up&rdquo;, but the goals dried up and  eventually the superior quality of Chelsea (Dixon, Speedie, Nevin et  al), the power of Sheffield Wednesday (Varadi, Sterland) and Newcastle  (Keegan, Beardsley and Waddle) proved too strong for us, but McNeill had  laid a good base having acquired Mick McCarthy earlier in the season  after Tommy Caton left for Arsenal. Quality additions like David  Phillips who went on to score 12 goals as well as the experience and  quality of Power, bargains like Jim Melrose, and an emerging silky  skills of Clive Wilson and young Paul Simpson helped City in a more  successful 1984-85 campaign when City sustained a challenge to the end,  and despite an eleventh hour serious wobble (typical City!) which put us  through the emotional mill, a triumphant 5-1 win over Charlton secured  promotion on the last day. To get City up having used the transfer  market astutely when funds were tight was a great achievement.<br> <br> There wasn&rsquo;t much more money to spend after promotion to the First  Division but McNeill fashioned a team that fought hard in his image but,  as ever, tried to play attractive football in 1985-86. True Blue Mark  Lillis was a bargain at &pound;132,500 when teams like Sheffield Wednesday and  Chelsea were spending much more. After an inconsistent start, McNeill&rsquo;s  team consolidated in the top flight and a top 10 place looked a  possibility before an end of season fade out saw us finish in the lower  half without falling into a relegation scrap.<br> <br> McNeill did a brilliant job on a very limited budget but he saw the  writing on the wall that summer, and gambled in the transfer market. His  shock decision to swap Mark Lillis for Trevor Christie and Paul Power&rsquo;s  departure to Everton ripped the heart out of City and a long struggle  beckoned. With Aston Villa chairman Doug Ellis dangling a bigger budget  and a more talented squad, McNeill was tempted and made the move down  the M6.<br> <br> It made many of us bitterly angry not only with Villa, but with McNeill.  At the time it felt like a betrayal, and it was very sweet to beat them  3-1 at Maine Road that season. 1986-87 was a long miserable season for  both clubs: McNeill inherited a Villa dressing room of attitude problems  despite its talent and finished bottom while City just weren&rsquo;t good  enough and finished 2nd to bottom.<br> <br> Billy McNeill was long forgiven by us, and much of that is due to his  humility and his admission that he should never have left City for  Villa. In any case, the good far outweighed that.<br> <br> He was very popular at City. Not only was Billy McNeill a very good  manager, but he always cared and made time to talk to fans. He was a  great man who is universally respected.<br> <br> I&rsquo;m so glad and proud that he managed Manchester City. Thanks for many happy memories.<br> <br> He had been suffering from dementia since 2010. My thoughts are with his family and friends.<br> <br> Phil B <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>  Obituary: William &lsquo;Billy&rsquo; McNeill, Celtic footballing legend, leader of the Lisbon Lions, Scottish internationalist</h3><br>Published: 12:13 Wednesday 24 April 2019<br>https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-william-billy-mcneill-celtic-footballing-legend-leader-of-the-lisbon-lions-scottish-internationalist-1-4914141<br>William &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; McNeill MBE &ndash; Celtic footballing legend. Born: 2 March 1940 in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire. Died: 22 April 2019 in Glasgow, aged 79<br><br>A bad year for Scottish football got worse on Tuesday, with the news that Billy McNeill, the greatest Celtic player and a true legend of the game, had lost his long and public battle with dementia.<br><br>The image of McNeill, standing on the balcony in Lisbon&rsquo;s National Stadium, holding aloft the newly minted European Cup is one of the iconic football ones. It has been replicated in bronze in front of Celtic Park, capturing as it does the greatest moment in the near 150-year history of Scotland and the Beautiful Game.<br><br>McNeill&rsquo;s club career is the stuff of legend. Born in Bellshill, the son of an Army PTO, he &ndash; apart from a short spell in England, where he went to a rugby-playing school &ndash; was a commanding centre half throughout his six years at Motherwell&rsquo;s Our Lady&rsquo;s High School.<br><br>He won Scotland Under-18 schoolboy honours, and his performance in a 3-0 win over England at Celtic Park in 1957, according to legend, forced the watching Jock Stein to tell Chairman Sir Robert Kelly: &ldquo;We must get that boy to the club.&rdquo;<br><br>McNeill needed little persuading. He left school, worked briefly for Lanarkshire County Council, then for Stenhouse, the insurance brokers, but, still a part-timer, he made his first-team debut against Clyde in August 1958. Celtic won.<br><br>He had to wait for his turn, since Bobby Evans was the incumbent Celtic and Scotland centre-half. However, Evans&rsquo; transfer to Chelsea in 1960 saw McNeill take over. He was still a part-timer, as he would continue to be until, after a successful apprenticeship via the Under-23 and Scottish League teams, he made his Scotland debut, in the notorious 9-3 Wembley loss to England in 1961.<br><br>McNeill emerged from that disaster with some credit, but, in what was to be a feature of his career, he never replicated at international level the success he would enjoy at his club. He only won 29 caps over an 11-year period, only led Scotland eight times, and was never the automatic choice for his country he was at club level.<br><br>Certainly, some injuries restricted his international appearances, but, at a time when the central defensive partnership of McNeill and John Clark at Celtic was recognised as just about the best in the business, they were only ever picked together once, in a 2-0 defeat to USSR in 1967.<br><br>The Celtic team which McNeill broke into was long on promise, short on silverware, and it was not until Stein was brought back as manager in February, 1965, that the club&rsquo;s fortunes turned. This was a fortuitous move for McNeill, who, disappointed at the way the club was stagnating, was contemplaing asking for a transfer.<br><br>Stein&rsquo;s return altered the Scottish football landscape totally and it was a towering McNeill header which secured a 3-2 Scottish Cup final victory over Dunfermline in 1965, ending the club&rsquo;s near eight year trophy drought and signalling the start of something special.<br><br>A League and League Cup double in 1966 demonstrated how the Stein revolution had changed things, but, Scottish football had not seen anything yet. In 1967 Celtic won every competition they entered, their season capped with that iconic image of McNeill holding aloft the European Cup, after holders Inter Milan had been totally crushed. The result might have been 2-1, the reality was, Celtic won by a mile. The legend of the Lisbon Lions was born.<br><br>The following years brought fantastic success, nine league wins in a row, other cup successes. In all, McNeill would go on &ndash; before he quit at the top &ndash; his last act as a footballer was to lift the Scottish Cup following victory over Airdrie in 1975 &ndash; to lift a then record 23 trophies as Celtic captain.<br>He retired, after 789 games for the club, all those trophies and medals, a Footballer of the Year award and an MBE for his services to the game.<br><br>He took a break for some 18 months, concentrating on a burgeoning business portfolio, but Clyde persuaded him to return to the game as manager and a record of four wins and three draws in eight games as a manager, saw him lured to Aberdeen in 1977 to follow Ally MacLeod, who had become the Scotland manager.<br><br>At Pittodrie, he won the League Cup, and gave Jock Wallace&rsquo;s treble-winning side a terrific run for their money. He had proved himself a more than competent manager, so, when the strained relationship between Stein and the Four Families who ran Celtic finally snapped and Stein was eased out of the door, the board turned to McNeill to continue his mentor&rsquo;s great work at the club.<br><br>Stein had survived 13 years of the machinations of the families, McNeill stood it for five. He turned also-rans into champions in one season, then won the Scottish Cup, then back-to-back league titles, before, in 1983, failing by one point to make it three titles in a row.<br><br>By then, however, McNeill had had enough of the board and, when the men upstairs offloaded Charlie Nicholas to Arsenal, McNeill too quit for England, and Manchester City.<br><br>City back then were the very-poor relations in Mancunian football, languishing in England&rsquo;s second tier. It took him two seasons, but McNeill got them back into the top flight, but, as at Celtic, he faced boardroom interference, and quit to join Aston Villa in 1986. This was not perhaps Billy&rsquo;s best move, since, at the end of that season, he had the unique distinction of having managed two of the relegated sides, as Villa and City both went down.<br><br>Peter Swales, his chairman at Manchester City, perhaps best summed-up the situation McNeill found himself in England, when he said: &ldquo;If ever a man was made for one club, it was Billy McNeill and Celtic; his heart was always at Parkhead.&rdquo;<br><br>To Celtic he returned. His successor, Davie Hay, had also had a difficult relationship with the men at the top of the club and when, in 1987, Celtic failed to defend the league title they had won so-memorably on the final day of the previous season, Hay was out and McNeill returned for a second spell at the club he loved.<br><br>He presided over a Centenary Year league and cup double in 1988, but, in addition to his travails with the four families on the board, McNeill also had his battles with chief executive Terry Cassidy before, in 1991, he walked away from the Celtic job.<br><br>He concentrated on his growing family and his business interests. McNeill&rsquo;s, his south-side pub was a place of pilgrimage to Celtic fans. He wrote a trenchant newspaper column, had a brief spell as director of football and caretaker manager at Hibs, but his rapprochment with Celtic was healed by the arrival of Fergus McCann.<br><br>McNeill and the Lisbon Lions were given their due place in Celtic history, the captain took on a Club Ambassador&rsquo;s role in 2009 and everything seemed set fair for his old age.<br><br>Then came the devastating news: dementia, that dreadful disease which seems to feast off former footballers, had taken Billy McNeill. His illness became public knowledge in 2015.<br><br>Celtic had to act. A statue of McNeill, in that legendary pose, holding aloft the European Cup, was commissioned and sited at Parkhead. The Celtic family, and the wider football community held its breath, Billy fought with all his amazing courage, but, on Tuesday morning came the news everyone had dreaded &ndash; he had lost his battle.<br><br>Wife Liz &ndash; they were one of football&rsquo;s most-gilded and loved couples &ndash; daughters Susan, twins Carol and Libby, Paula and son Martyn, have lost a loving and devoted father. Billy&rsquo;s grand-children have lost a doting and much-loved Papa.<br><br>The surviving Lions have lost the leader of their pride, the Celtic family has lost one of its icons. In his early days at the club, because he was one of the few players who owned a car, McNeill was dubbed &ldquo;Cesar&rdquo; by his team mates. The name came from actor Cesar Romero, who had played the getaway driver in the original version of Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven.<br><br>After seeing him with the European Cup in Lisbon, Bertie Auld decided: henceforth Billy would be Cesar, because he looked like a Roman God as he held aloft the giant cup.<br><br>As we prepare to bury Cesar, we should praise him. Billy McNeill MBE, with his honorary Doctorate from Glasgow University and his place in the Scottish Football Hall of Fame, was not just the greatest Celt, he was one of the all-time greats of Scottish football.<br><br>MATTHEW VALLANCE  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>  Addio a Stevie Chalmers, leader del Celtic che faceva sognare</h3>https://www.ilfoglio.it/sport/2019/04/30/news/addio-a-stevie-chalmers-leader-del-celtic-che-faceva-sognare-252135/<br>Guida dei Lisbon Lions, se ne &egrave; andato il giocatore che aveva contribuito al mito della squadra scozzese che aveva dominato anche in Europa<br><br>di Emmanuele Michela<br><br>30 Aprile 2019 alle 20:16<br>Addio a Stevie Chalmers, leader del Celtic che faceva sognare<br><br>I Lisbon Lions<br><br>C&rsquo;&egrave; un aneddoto curioso - ma pure ricco di significato - che affiora dalla giovent&ugrave; di Stevie Chalmers, l&rsquo;ex campione del Celtic degli anni Sessanta morto ieri. Aveva appena vent&rsquo;anni quando, nel &rsquo;55, si ammal&ograve; di meningite tubercolare, un male che poteva essergli fatale e che per sei mesi lo costrinse in ospedale: a lottare con lui c&#39;era il dottor Peter McKenzie che segu&igrave; una cura innovativa per tentare di salvare quel giovane calciatore. Furono settimane terribili, a tu per tu con una malattia che all&rsquo;epoca non dava speranze di vita: &quot;Quando nessuno mi guardava, buttavo le mie gambe di l&agrave; del letto per tentare di muoverle&quot;, racconter&agrave; il calciatore. &quot;Mi piace credere che la mia buona salute e la forma fisica mi abbiano aiutato&quot;. Si salv&ograve; Chalmers, e McKenzie promuover&agrave; la sua terapia in giro per il mondo - nessun altro paziente era riuscito a uscire vivo dall&rsquo;ospedale, all&rsquo;epoca, dopo avere contratto quella meningite. Il medico, che era tifosissimo dei Rangers, non sapeva per&ograve; che aveva salvato la vita a quello che diventer&agrave; uno dei migliori calciatori di sempre. Chalmers, 261 partite coi Bhoys e 155 reti in 12 anni, oltre a essere un fuoriclasse era pure un gentleman, e non romper&agrave; mai i rapporti col luminare, nonostante lo sport li volesse contro. &quot;Il mio successo &egrave; il suo successo&quot;, gli scriver&agrave; anni dopo, in seguito all&rsquo;esordio con gol nel suo primo Old Firm, ovvero il tanto combattuto derby della citt&agrave; di Glasgow.<br><br><br><br>Chalmers sale in cielo esattamente una settimana dopo il suo capitano Billy McNeill. Bomber il primo, leader il secondo. Entrambi nel Celtic pi&ugrave; forte di sempre, quello che i tifosi dell&rsquo;Inter pi&ugrave; stagionati ricorderanno per la Coppa Campioni persa dai nerazzurri nel &rsquo;67 a Lisbona. I meneghini arrivavano da tre edizioni in cui avevano dominato l&rsquo;Europa, con due successi (&rsquo;64 e &rsquo;65) e una semifinale (nel &rsquo;66, persa col Real poi campione) sotto il &quot;mago&quot; Herrera. Insomma, pareva certo che quegli 11 scozzesi nati tutti a poche miglia dallo stadio di Parkhead dovessero soccombere, come per altro il gol precoce di Mazzola sembrava confermare. Poi la partita cambi&ograve;, i biancoverdi pareggiarono con Gemmell e a 7 minuti dal termine Chalmers si trov&ograve; sulla traiettoria del tiro di Bobby Murdoch per insaccare il gol pi&ugrave; facile, ma pure il pi&ugrave; prezioso, della sua carriera. <br><br> <br><br>Nacquero l&igrave; i Lisbon Lions, un marchio che sa di mito, tanto da diventare il nome di una delle gradinate dello stadio del Celtic. Un mito come le maglie biancoverdi intonse, tanto belle da non volere numeri sulla schiena ma solo sui pantaloncini, perch&eacute; le hoops - cos&igrave; diceva il presidente dell&rsquo;epoca, Desmond White - &quot;non si prestano ai numeri&quot;. Un mito che sa perfino di beffa per il pallone britannico, che aveva s&igrave; inventato il football ma fu costretto a vedere una squadra scozzese, per di pi&ugrave; dall&rsquo;animo cattolico e irlandese, essere la prima rappresentante dell&rsquo;isola a vincere un trofeo continentale. Un mito come il treble, un concetto che in Italia conosciamo come triplete, nostalgico tuffo di gloria per i tifosi dell&rsquo;Inter e ossessione per gli juventini. Gli scozzesi c&rsquo;erano arrivati gi&agrave; nel &rsquo;67, vincendo per primi in Europa campionato, Coppa di lega e Coppa Campioni in un&rsquo;unica stagione, scrivendo - forse senza sapere quale peso avrebbe avuto tale en plein - un pezzo della storia del pallone. <br><br> <br><br>Il dramma &egrave; che il tempo corre pi&ugrave; dell&rsquo;imprendibile Jimmy Johnstone, e di anno in anno i ragazzi che fecero l&rsquo;impresa del &rsquo;67 muoiono. Per i tifosi del Celtic, i Lisbon Lions restano un passato sempre aureo ma pure malinconico, lontano da un oggi ben diverso, che - anche a causa del fallimento dei Rangers del 2012, con successiva retrocessione in quarta serie - vede i Bhoys dominare facilmente il campionato, ma poi soccombere alla prova europea. I britannici hanno un rapporto con gli eroi dei propri club che &egrave; sempre profondo: silenzio e sacralit&agrave;, come di fronte a un nonno che racconta una guerra sportiva che ognuno di noi avrebbe voluto combattere. E quando sabato scorso, nel match contro il Kilmarnock, il Celtic si &egrave; fermato per ricordare Billy McNeill, l&rsquo;atmosfera allo stadio &egrave; stata unica. <br><br> <br><br>&quot;Hail Cesar&quot;, il saluto del popolo bianconero al suo capitano, in campo per 486 partite in 18 anni coi biancoverdi, per poi tornare da allenatore a Parkhead. Pensare che quel soprannome, &ldquo;Cesar&rdquo;, nacque grazie a un film: McNeill era andato al cinema con alcuni compagni di squadra per vedere &quot;Colpo Grosso&quot;, con Frank Sinatra e Cesar Romero, che nella pellicola recita la parte del conducente d&rsquo;auto. McNeill, l&rsquo;unico del gruppo ad avere patente e macchina, si trov&ograve; addosso il nome di quell&rsquo;attore, che lo ha accompagnato nei suoi exploit in biancoverde e ha dato il nome alla sua terza e ultima autobiografia (devi averne di cose da raccontare in tanti anni di Celtic). &quot;Vincere potrebbe essere stato per la Scozia, ma sicuramente non per la Gran Bretagna... &Egrave; stato per il Celtic&quot;, furono le sue parole sul successo di Lisbona, giusto per dare il senso - anche sociale e politico - a una vittoria che va pi&ugrave; in l&agrave; di quel trofeo che il capitano sollev&ograve; al cielo. <br><br> <br><br>Tratti e cartoline di un calcio che in Scozia non c&rsquo;&egrave; pi&ugrave;, terra che col football ha sempre avuto un rapporto tutto suo: una nazionale da poche gioie, due club che si odiano ma che si tengono in piedi a vicenda, una marea di altre squadre &quot;piccole&quot; ma ruspanti e una teoria di straordinari allenatori quasi inspiegabile. Ci sar&agrave; un motivo se certi maestri del pallone come Ferguson, Dalglish, Shankly e Busby sono cresciuti a nord del Vallo di Adriano? Jock Stein, il manager di quel Celtic, era uno di loro. Aria burbera e bel calcio, fango e velocit&agrave;. Era andato dietro al pallone per fuggire da una vita nelle miniere di carbone, come toccava a tutti gli uomini del suo paese, nel Lanarkshire. Coi Bhoys fu giocatore, allenatore delle riserve e poi tecnico della prima squadra. Non lo volevano perch&eacute; sarebbe stato Scrisse la storia diventando il primo manager protestante della squadra cattolica di Glasgow, e portandola sul tetto d&rsquo;Europa.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3><span class="diffAdd">  Bernard Ponsonby&#39;s farewell to Celtic legend Billy McNeill</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">Bernard Ponsonby Bernard Ponsonby</span><br><span class="diffAdd">2 hours ago</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Funeral set to take place for the man who led the Lisbon Lions to the 1967 European Cup.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">https://stv.tv/sport/football/1437487-bernard-ponsonby-s-touching-farewell-to-billy-mcneill/</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Early in 2003 I went to the Crutherland House hotel in East Kilbride. I was filming a story about two Old Firm legends who were lending their support to a man that was standing for the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party at the Scottish Parliament elections.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">John Swinburne introduced his two famous backers: Billy McNeill and Eric Caldow.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Swinburne, as I was later to learn, had attended every match played by Motherwell Football Club in the preceding 50 years. Let me repeat that, he had not missed a game in over half a century. A product of industrial Lanarkshire, Swinburne loved the weekend release that football gave against the often harsh realities of work down the pit or in the steelworks.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He found kindred spirits in his illustrious backers. McNeill was a Lanarkshire man too and a lifelong socialist who had decided to give his support to the cause of dignity in retirement. Rangers legend Caldow was an Ayrshire man, a county fashioned by the land, by mining and farming.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Swinburne, McNeill and Caldow were plain-speaking men. Swinburne was passionate about pensioners, McNeill effortlessly articulate and Caldow carried himself with a quiet dignity. When you meet such people you just know they are the real deal.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In the days before footballers were feted as superstars, men like Billy McNeill would stop and sign autographs as they made their way into the front door of Celtic Park before a match. They were not averse to stopping for a chat, waving to an old school friend, acknowledging a neighbour.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">These were the simple but appreciated gestures that said those who wore the jerseys were just like those who cheered them on.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">McNeill&#39;s death marks the passing of an iconic figure, a man for whom the word legend is, for once, truly appropriate. It is an abused word when applied to the multi-millionaires of 2019 who are frequently here today and gone tomorrow in search of a fatter pay cheque.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And yet in the history of the Scottish game, men like McNeill at Celtic, John Greig at Rangers, Willie Miller at Aberdeen will provide the rich narrative of success that soars over the &#39;stars&#39; of today who will provide a depressing length of foot-notes defined by relative failure.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">McNeill takes us back to a different time. Boys (and there were few women at football back then) were lifted over the turnstile. Language was industrial and fuelled by carry outs of hard, gut-rotting liquor, dispensed from brown paper bags. There were macaroon bars and spearmint gum to eat and chew. The &agrave; la carte offering was rolls and spam sold by bunneted men who all looked the same.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">These were the days before marketing men, corporate boxes, press officers managing image and brand reputation. It was all so much more real back then, all so much more uncomplicated and all the more genuine for it was defined by men like McNeill.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Our game has changed, marked depressingly by relative failure on the pitch and a different relationship between fan and player off it. Now youngsters idolise people they don&#39;t know. In a better yesterday you didn&#39;t need to ambush a player for an autograph you simply approached and talked to them.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It&#39;s important not to be overly nostalgic. Back in the 1970s football stadia were, by today&#39;s standards, unsafe. They were also bastions of male chauvinism. Family entertainment it was not. The paying fan wasn&#39;t even accorded the dignity of going to the toilet in comfort. There is something both comical and disgusting about the sight, never mind the smell of a mass &#39;pee-in&#39;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Back to big Billy. It was May 16, 2008 and this time I was in his front room waiting to interview him about Tommy Burns. The red-haired Caltonian had succumbed to cancer the night before. Can I get you anything? Tea? Coffee? Do you need me to move anything for the camera? How are you doing, Bernard? There was something really big about McNeill and it wasn&#39;t just his physical presence.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In recent days a wealth of anecdotes have appeared about Stevie Chalmers all testament to his fundamental decency. I read one, recalled by a Rangers fan about his Celtic supporting uncle who died very young from an incurable disease. Chalmers was his hero and the young man wrote to him every week. The letters were reciprocated by visits to the young man&#39;s home and to hospital. Social media has a picture of young Brian wearing Chalmers&#39; 1967 Lisbon strip. It is the simplest and kindest of gestures that are truly the greatest.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The efforts of McNeill and Caldow in 2003 bore fruit. John Swinburne was elected an MSP in May of that year. Seven weeks before Billy McNeill died, Eric Caldow passed away.
