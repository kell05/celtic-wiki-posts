On Friday, Celtic chief executive Allan MacDonald displayed sorcerer&#39;s talents that would gain him automatic entry to the Magic Circle in revealing that the European league he craves for his club might be only two years away from coming into existence. <br><br>We have been here before, of course, with MacDonald talking up the formation of a so-called Atlantic League as the way forward not so long ago. <br>It was a proposition strangled at birth by UEFA, who declared that those who dared join what was to be a breakaway set-up would be banned from taking part in any competitions under the European governing body&#39;s auspices. <br><br>Now the word &quot;breakaway&quot; itself has been banned from discussions that are designed to ensure the Old Firm leave Scotland for richer pastures on the continent. This time, MacDonald insists, it is the real deal. <br><br>In fairness to the Scottish football-friendly Celtic chief executive, the latest proposals do appear to surmount some of the glaring obstacles that were overlooked in the plans for the Atlantic League. Crucially, central to the establishment of European League Mk II - over which the Old Firm have been meeting with representatives of top Dutch, Portuguese and Belgian clubs - is the Old Firm being seen to be taking the rest of Scottish football with them. <br>Initially, there is likely to be no place in the continental set-up for all but the Glasgow behemoths plus AN Other, in what is envisaged as a 16-club league. <br>However, those teams left behind to compete in a Scottish set-up will have the opportunity to go forward to their European cousin. In contrast, there was no provision for relegation or promotion in the plan for the Atlantic League, one of the rocks on which it foundered. <br><br>&quot;When we talked about an Atlantic League we were proposing a solution without examining the problems,&quot; MacDonald says. &quot;The discussions which have been ongoing regarding this latest project examine all the issues. The Atlantic league was a non-starter because it was a closed shop. UEFA would never give their blessing to this but will listen to us if we can demonstrate the new model could ultimately be to the benefit of the national associations and domestic leagues of each of the countries involved.&quot; <br><br>MacDonald uses the term &quot;solidarity&quot; to sum up the provisions being discussed that would make for a compensation package for the rump SPL, which would be created by three Scottish clubs joining the major players of Holland, Portugal and Belgium. Scandinavian countries and, curiously, a number of French sides have expressed an interest in becoming involved. MacDonald would not elaborate on the identity of these clubs but confirmed that Ajax, Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven, Benfica, Porto, Anderlecht and Standard Liege have attended the monthly get-togethers - the most recent of which was in Amsterdam on Friday afternoon - aimed at creating a configuration acceptable to all concerned and one that would ensure Champions League places were secured by those finishing in the top places of the European League. <br><br>&quot;We [the Old Firm] could only take our place at these meetings once we had briefed our national association and league,&quot; MacDonald explained. &quot;In the case of the SFA, they listened with interest, while the SPL supported serious dialogue.&quot; <br><br>The fine detail has still to be ironed out but MacDonald believes the exercise of creating a working model to take to UEFA and the various national associations could be completed &quot;within four months&quot;. <br><br>&quot;The Dutch boys are keen to have the league up and running in two years but in my experience in business these things tend to take longer than anticipated,&quot; Celtic&#39;s chief executive admits. <br><br>An indication of how much in its infancy this European league remains, though, is illustrated by the fact that the size of the pool of countries it will draw from has yet to be finalised. <br>&quot;Structurally we have to decide if we want to go deep and have a limited number of countries involved providing four or five teams, or go wider with eight nations providing two teams each,&quot; MacDonald states. &quot;I think we favour going deeper because that retains greater tribal interest which could be more attractive to television audiences.&quot; <br><br>Ah, television, the drug of the nation, indeed. Getting a healthy fix is, unsurprisingly, what establishing the new set-up is all about. For with a potential audience of around 60 million, the European league could be expected to generate the television revenue that presently flows, and keeps afloat, clubs in the Premiership and the other countries whose leagues compose &#39;the big five&#39; in the form of Italy, Spain, Germany and France. <br><br>A man who appears to enjoy dabbling with figures, MacDonald highlights that while Celtic&#39;s income from television deals last season was &pound;2.49m, the new Sky deal signed with the Premiership clubs could net Manchester United in the region of &pound;29m. Mid-ranking clubs in England&#39;s top flight can expect to earn around &pound;20m. <br>&quot;We would not be looking at sums of this nature when we signed our first contract, but by the time it came to agreeing a second deal four years down the line, the revenue for each team could be between &pound;15m and &pound;25m. By then, the league could be as competitive as any in Europe,&quot; MacDonald says. <br>The Celtic chief executive dismissed his club&#39;s current positioning in the game as &quot;not economically viable&quot; and the SPL as, to all intents in purposes, a &quot;technically bankrupt&quot; league with most clubs losing money on a monthly basis. <br><br>Deprived of the gate receipts from Old Firm home fixtures, the monetary concerns of the Scottish teams left to chase a European dream in the event of this latest league proposal becoming reality are only likely to be exacerbated. Whatever gloss the Old Firm may wish to put on their present moves, the harsh fact is that they would not endure too many sleepless nights if the SPL, in their absence, was scaled down to something akin to the League of Ireland. Unless, of course, they found themselves back playing there. The detail of how promotion and relegation from a European league would work in practice remains a decidedly grey area. It is reasonable to assume that lesser Belgian and, if brought on board, Scandinavian sides would be no more of a match for the Old Firm than Motherwell or Hearts. However, in theory, a truly disastrous season for either of the Glasgow sides in a European league could result in them being dropped back into a Scottish set-up. Winning such a domestic title would be a shoe-in but provide little in the way of interest for their huge fan bases since Old Firm derbies would not exist. <br><br>Equally, were Scotland&#39;s two leading lights unable to mount a serious challenge for a European league, would they continue to attract full houses for meaningless matches against the likes of a Gent or a Boavista? <br><br>MacDonald might be entitled to feel a sense of frustration over the fact that, despite being in charge of a club sitting fifth highest in the world in terms of paid attendances, the salaries on offer to the highest-paid players at Leicester City - whose average gate is one third of the Parkhead side&#39;s - outstrip those he can sensibly offer. <br><br>Celtic cannot afford to continue to haemorrhage cash at the rate of almost &pound;6m a year, irrespective of the fact that have a borrowing facility that allows them to go &pound;30m in to the red. MacDonald may be over-egging the pudding in claiming that Celtic&#39;s long-term survival is dependent on his club operating in a more lucrative market, but what is without question is that the club will not sustain average gates of 60,000 if it remains tied to the SPL. <br><br>Unless, of course, Martin O&#39;Neill can be the catalyst to Celtic rediscovering the art of winning domestic championships. <br>As if there wasn&#39;t enough resting on the Irishman&#39;s shoulders.<br><br><h3>    The Atlantic League: So what&#39;s it all about ...?</h3><font size="1">Scotland on Sunday  13/08/2000<br>MOIRA GORDON</font><br><br> <i>Who would be involved in new league? </i><br><ul><li>The top three teams in Scotland would be joined by the best that Belgium, Holland, Portugal and Scandinavia have to offer. Unlike the earlier doomed Atlantic League, this Atlantic League Mark II is not exclusive to the Old Firm. As well as including the third-best team in the initial set-up, relegation and promotion are part and parcel of the deal, allowing the side finishing top of the new-look SPL the chance to gain entry to the new league, although they will probably have to take part in a play-off. </li></ul><i>When would it start? </i><br><ul><li>Nothing has been rubber- stamped, but it is unlikely to be up and running until the season after next, at the earliest.The &#39;pencilled-in&#39; start date was for the 2002-2003 season.<br></li></ul><i>How would it work? </i><br><ul><li>It would be a 16-team league, with promotion and relegation from the domestic leagues of the countries involved. The clubs would play each other twice throughout the season, home and away. </li></ul><i>Is this the end for the remaining SPL clubs? </i><br><ul><li>Well, thanks to the aforementioned promotion and relegation, they will have the opportunity to join the new league, provided they do well at domestic level.With the Old Firm gone, teams of a similar standard will be left to challenge for the domestic league, making results less predictable and leading to honours being shared around. But it is likely that the clubs involved in the new league will still participate in the Scottish Cup. For those claiming that the absence of the Big Two will hit them financially, they need not worry. One of the pledges is that the teams left behind will be compensated, leaving them no worse off than at present. </li></ul><i>Are they happy about it? </i><br><ul><li>Happy may be too strong a description, but the majority seem to have resigned themselves to the fact that the Old Firm want out, and this is the best offer they have had so far. Unlike past systems, this one at least offers them the chance of gaining more domestic honours while not losing out financially. It also leaves the door ajar for the more ambitious clubs to join the Old Firm at some stage in the future. </li></ul><i>What are UEFA saying about all this? </i><br><ul><li>Although no-one at UEFA has made an official comment, the mood seems positive. Unlike the earlier Atlantic League concept, UEFA would seemingly recognise this revamped version, provided the remaining SPL clubs were compensated and there was the prospect of relegation and promotion between the new league and the SPL. This means the top finishers would be able to compete in the Champions League and the UEFA Cup. The idea would be dead and buried already if that was not the case. UEFA and the individual footballing authorities from all the countries involved have participated in the early discussions and, in principle, most appear happy to lend their support. </li></ul><i>Will it really help Scottish clubs in European cup competitions? </i><br><ul><li>Depends who you ask. Celtic and Rangers believe it will. They feel constricted by the limitations of the Scottish domestic scene, and are desperate to spread their wings. They say that competing with top European teams on a regular basis will enhance their Champions League chances. Others insist the Parkhead and Ibrox teams could compete just as well if they remained in the SPL. Time will tell.  </li></ul><br><h3>    Football: Euroleague dead says PSV chief</h3><font size="1">Daily Record 20/10/2000</font><br><br> PSV Eindhoven chief Harry van Raaij last night claimed the Old Firm&#39;s hopes of starring in a new Euroleague are dead. <br>Dutch giants PSV are one of 12 clubs, including Celtic and Rangers, attempting to win UEFA&#39;s backing for a new structure. <br>However, UEFA spokesman Mike Lee said: &quot;The national leagues are the cradle of football. <br>&quot;We understand the problems of these clubs but we value the national leagues. What would remain of them when the big clubs leave?&quot; <br><br>Van Raaij said: &quot;We, the originators of the Euroleague, have a meeting with the executive committee of UEFA in December. <br>&quot;A decision will be made then but when all kinds of remarks are coming from UEFA, then we might as well give up. <br>&quot;This is not the way to treat us. We have always put our cards on the table and we get this. <br>&quot;Mr Lee says he understands our problems but nothing is being done. It&#39;s like going to the doctor with a stomach ache and not being treated.&quot; <br>Van Raaij believes the championships in countries such as Scotland and Holland will become second rate if the status quo is maintained. <br>He said: &quot;The obstacle is that UEFA is a power block and wants to keep its structure. They don&#39;t want to lose their power over the clubs. <br>&quot;UEFA are afraid their position will be diminished. But if things remain the same, then we in Holland will forever lose contact with big football countries and become a second Denmark.&quot;  <br><br></div>
