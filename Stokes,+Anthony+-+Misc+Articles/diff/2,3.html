Three years  on, a rejuvenated Stokes&#39; football future looks far more  secure. <br><br>Now  22, Stokes is flourishing in the green and white  hoops of Celtic. A  typically adroit finish against Aberdeen in midweek  provided his eighth  goal in six games, taking the Dubliner&#39;s tally for  the season to 17 in  all competitions. Such impressive form has not  impressed Giovanni  Trapattoni, who named the Celtic hit man in the  29-man squad for  Ireland&#39;s Carling Nations Cup opener against Wales at  the Aviva Stadium  on Tuesday night, but then left him off the revised  squad. Stokes has so  far struggled to break into the Ireland set-up  under the Italian&#39;s  regime, much to the striker&#39;s frustration. &quot;It&#39;s  been a while since I&#39;ve  been picked, but I still really want to play  for my country,&quot; the tall,  athletic former Terenure College student  says.<br><br>Stokes, who won  his three international caps to date  during Steve Staunton&#39;s ill-fated  tenure, has not featured in an  Ireland shirt since 2007. &quot;I was in a lot  of the squads when  [Trapattoni] came in. <br><br>Even when I wasn&#39;t  playing for Sunderland  at the time, I was there or thereabouts. But a  lot of the time when I  was in the squad, other players would be drafted  in who were on standby  and they would play ahead of me.&quot;<br><br>Speaking  from Celtic&#39;s  labyrinthine Lennoxtown training complex at the foothills  of the  bucolic Campsie hills, a half an hour&#39;s drive and a world away  from the  bustle of Glasgow city centre, Stokes is relaxed about his   international prospects but would clearly relish a run in the Ireland   team: &quot;I don&#39;t know what the situation is to be honest, but if I get the   chance I want to take it. Until then, all I can do is concentrate on  my  form for my club.&quot;<br><br>Concentration has never been Stokes&#39;   strongest suit -- while his senior career got off to a blistering start   when he scored 14 goals in 16 games on loan at Falkirk from Arsenal,  his  subsequent spell at Sunderland was marked by inconsistency. But the   striker has settled well into life at Celtic Park, following his &pound;1.2   million move from SPL rivals Hibernian in August. &quot;I hit a spot a few   months back where I was struggling to get into the team, but now that   I&#39;ve got myself back in and back scoring goals, everything is looking   up.&quot;<br><br>His almost telepathic relationship with another summer   arrival, target man Gary Hooper, has been a revelation at Celtic Park   this season, taking the Hoops to the top of the SPL and Stokes to third   in the scorers&#39; chart (behind ex-Rangers man Kenny Miller and another   young Dubliner, Conor Sammon, who left Kilmarnock for Wigan Athletic on   deadline day last week).<br><br>With Stokes now displaying all the   confidence and verve of a top player, it is easy to forget how close the   striker came to fulfilling the other, doom-laden, half of Roy Keane&#39;s   prophecy. Barely 18 months ago, the rangy Dubliner seemed more likely  to  figure in a kick and run contest in the Conference than a senior   international at the Aviva. Languishing in Sunderland&#39;s reserves   following a couple of uninspired loan moves to the Championship, Stokes   was drifting, struggling to re-ignite the promise that saw him break   into Arsenal&#39;s reserves at just 15, having joined the Gunners from   Shelbourne. <br><br>Stokes sees the move to Hibernian, which reunited   him with former Falkirk boss John Hughes, as a pivotal moment in his   career. He absorbed a huge cut in wages to join the Easter Road outfit   in 2009. &quot;I knew going to Hibs that I had to start my career over again   because things had gone badly towards the end of my time at Sunderland.   Going to Hibs, I just wanted to get focused on my football and back   playing every week. That was the main thing. I wasn&#39;t thinking of where I   was going.&quot;<br><br>Celtic coveted Stokes back at the start of 2007. He   chose to go to Sunderland instead -- &quot;the Keane thing was a big  factor&quot;  -- but when Hoops manager Neil Lennon came knocking at the  start of this  season the decision was a no-brainer: &quot;As soon as I knew  they were  interested I wanted to come. It was as simple as that.&quot;<br><br>If   leaving Hibs for Celtic was easy, swapping life in genteel Edinburgh  for  the goldfish bowl that is Glasgow has been somewhat less   straightforward. Unlike most of his team-mates, Stokes does not live in   the so-called City of Love, commuting instead from his home on the   western edge of Edinburgh -- although even there the tensions that swirl   around Scottish football, and the Old Firm in particular, are hard to   avoid.<br><br>Back in October, a mob of around 15 Rangers supporters   surrounded Stokes&#39; house after an Old Firm game. The Celt was not in but   his parents, John and Joan, were trapped inside while the gang sang   sectarian songs, shouted threats and threw a wheelie bin at his living   room window. <br><br>Keen to play down the incident, Stokes insists that   he has had no problems since: &quot;That was just a one-off thing. It was   just after the first Rangers game I played in. A few people came around   to the house but that was it really. Since then I&#39;ve had no bother   whatsoever.&quot; <br><br>It is difficult to imagine such a sanguine reaction   from the friendly, insouciant Anthony Stokes I first met in Edinburgh   12 months ago. Now he cuts an altogether more circumspect character.   Where once he sat on the edge of a table chatting garrulously, now he   sits bolt upright, arms folded across his chest for the entire   interview. While he still speaks freely, his responses are more guarded   than they once were. <br><br>It is difficult to gauge whether Stokes  has  genuinely matured or if the media training at Celtic Park is simply   that bit keener. However, the striker&#39;s ability to grab the wrong   headlines has not completely left the building, as an ill-advised taxi   ride after the Celtic Christmas party proved.<br><br>&quot;We were down in   London for our Christmas team night out,&quot; Stokes explains. &quot;I hadn&#39;t   been feeling well for about two weeks before that. We had a good day or   two on it and there was another day to come. I just couldn&#39;t take any   more so I decided to come home.&quot;<br><br>The only problem was that   Britain was in the grip of the coldest spell in 30 years. With all   flights and trains north cancelled, Stokes decided to get a cab home, a   374-mile journey that set him back &pound;600 and sent Scottish red top   journalists caterwauling. &quot;There were probably a few too many drinks   had,&quot; Stokes laughs. &quot;Not the best idea I&#39;ve ever had, but I was   delighted to get back to my bed.&quot;<br><br>Thankfully for Celtic, and for   Stokes, this season his performances on the pitch have received far  more  attention than any off-field antics. The Bhoys are proving  remarkably  buoyant in Lennon&#39;s first full season in charge. Five points  clear of  arch-rivals Rangers at the summit of the SPL and in the  League Cup  final, they are unbeaten in 13 games going into today&#39;s  Scottish Cup Old  Firm clash. <br><br>While a Cup victory would be  welcomed, Celtic&#39;s  season will be regarded as a failure unless they  regain the league title  from an impecunious Rangers who, despite their  dire financial straits,  could still overhaul the Hoops. For Stokes a  few more goals and a first  piece of silverware would round off a  satisfying debut season.<br><br>Growing  up in Templeogue, there was  only one team in the Stokes household. &quot;I  never really supported a team  in the Premiership.

You have to think about the child, and what&#39;s best for them.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;That&#39;s why nothing ever really bothers me because I know I did it for the right reasons.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;I   understand why I did it and so does Anthony, and that&#39;s all that   matters. We have a good relationship and he has always known he was   adopted by my sister and her husband. It was never hidden.&#39;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;John and Joan have been so good to my family. I never would have given him to anyone else.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">She added: &quot;I often think of other mums who have given their kids up - it&#39;s not one bit easy for anyone.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;It was so heartbreaking for me, it broke my heart, but what can you do? I can&#39;t change it now.</span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">ann byrne anthony stokes Image 1</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;He   was a lively little boy and I had great help from my sister.

He is doing really well and the kids all get on.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Anthony   was Ann&#39;s third child and she revealed he has two full biological   siblings. Her oldest child Geraldine was born in September 1980 in   Dublin and Anthony&#39;s older brother Michael was born in 1985.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">But   yesterday Stokes&#39;s adoptive dad John, who is really his uncle,  admitted:  &quot;It has caused a lot of trouble at home and caused a lot of  problems  for my own family.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;Some of them found out about it secondhand and that&#39;s not the way we would have wanted them to find out.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">A   source said: &quot;The family wanted to keep things within the circle. But   Anthony loves them all and still regards John as his dad.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;His sister has been to Scotland a few times to watch him play.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">John   has represented Anthony as his agent but hit the headlines when he   claimed the star was ready to quit the club after an Old Firm game.</span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">anthony stokes Image 3</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">He put up a 40ft banner on his Dublin pub, The Players&#39; Lounge, opposing the visit of the Queen to Ireland earlier this year.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">And   in May he was arrested by police investigating a turf war between Real   IRA terrorists and crime gangs and has denied charges of assault,   threats and possession of stun guns.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Anthony has publicly praised John and Joan when he talked about going on trial at Arsenal at a crucial time in his career.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">He   said: &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have stuck it out had they not been with me.   If my mum and dad had still been in Dublin there&#39;s every chance I&#39;d  have  been on the first flight home.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">In an another interview he said of John: &quot;My dad was massive for me. When I was younger he would really push me.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;I was doing quite well at a young age but he realised the standard in England was on a different level.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Ann   even told how people have commented on the physical resemblance  between  Anthony and John, who do not share a biological link.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Recalling   the handover to Joan, she said: &quot;When I gave Anthony to her, she  wanted  to do it properly so they legally adopted him and gave him their   surname.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;In those days you just had to sign the papers and  after  that I never heard another thing about it. The first three years  were  very hard.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;It broke my heart but I suppose things were  made  easier for me because I could see how happy he was. I only had to  look  at him to see he was OK.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;Anthony has always known, since  the age  of two, from the time the adoption process got under way. You  should  never tell the kids lies, and I told them to tell him straight  from the  start who he is.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;We stayed close but I couldn&#39;t take him back years later and change it.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;He&#39;s   great at what he does. I&#39;m proud of him. Everyone around here knows I   had him and I was always afraid that someone would make the adoption   public someday without us knowing.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;But I&#39;ve often been dying for   people to know what I go through. I&#39;m often sitting on a bus when I  see  someone carrying a baby and I think about it then. It was very,  very  hard back then.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">She added: &quot;We&#39;ve often sat together and  I&#39;d  say: &#39;Is there anything you want to ask me?&#39; and he&#39;d say: &#39;No, I  know  you did nothing wrong... I&#39;ve no problem with anything&#39;.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;I often wondered why he never asks me anything but I think that&#39;s because there were no secrets.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;People think he owes me a living but he definitely doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s doing his own thing and I&#39;m happy for him.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Stokes was one of the hottest prospects in Irish football when he joined Arsenal as a teenager in 2005.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">He later went to Falkirk and Hibs before signing for Celtic in a &pound;1million deal last year.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">He was the club&#39;s joint top scorer last season with 20 goals in 42 games.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Stokes and Celtic declined to comment last night. </span></div><div class="body"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tbody><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tr><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></div><h3 class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></h3><div class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></div><h3 class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  Stokes driven out of home by yobs</span></h3><div class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Anthony Stokes   </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Edinburgh Evening News</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Published on Monday 21 November 2011 12:00</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">CELTIC   star Anthony Stokes and his heavily pregnant girlfriend are set to  quit  their West Lothian home after a gang of yobs laid siege to the  luxury  property at the weekend.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">The gang smashed a window of their &pound;400,000 Broxburn home in the early hours of Saturday morning.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Debbie   Lawlor, 24, is understood to have been alone in the house while  Stokes,  23, was in Inverness ahead of the Parkhead side&rsquo;s clash with  Caley  Thistle.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Neighbours of the couple said they have not returned home since the attack and are looking to move out.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">The   attack came after a mob of 15 youths laid siege to the property and   hurled a wheelie bin at a window after the Old Firm clash in October   2010. Stokes was also away during that incident when a gang shouted   death threats and sang sectarian songs, but his parents were trapped   inside.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Today one neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: &ldquo;We   heard shouting between 2am and 3am in the morning. When we came down  on  Saturday morning the window was smashed.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;Debbie said she was in the house. It&rsquo;s the last thing you need in her condition.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;Anthony   was in Inverness and it must worry him to hear about this nonsense   going on when he is away. They headed through to Glasgow on Saturday   night and we haven&rsquo;t seen them since.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Neighbour Jim Armstrong, 51, said he spoke to Debbie on Saturday afternoon and boarded up the window for her.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">He said: &ldquo;She&rsquo;s seven or eight months pregnant. If she was in when it happened she must have had a bit of a fright.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;I think she was a wee bit upset. I know Anthony phoned her to go to Glasgow after it.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;Whoever   did it obviously targeted the house, because my van was sitting there   and they haven&rsquo;t touched it. I think it&rsquo;s a Rangers-Celtic thing. It&rsquo;s a   piece of nonsense. He signs tops for the kids around here and things   like that. It&rsquo;s a shame because I think they want to move now. They are   fantastic neighbours.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Last year former Hibs ace Stokes, who moved to Celtic in 2010, vowed to stand up to bigots after the first attack.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">However, he is thought to want to leave the rented house after the latest incident.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">A   source said: &ldquo;They are looking to get out of the area now. Debbie is   due early next year and so they will have a kid to think about too.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">They   added: &ldquo;They are great neighbours and it is disgraceful that they have   to put up with this.

In his circle of friends in Dublin  the  Celtic striker has some of the city&rsquo;s most notorious criminals,  some of  whom are, or were, members of the Real IRA, the terrorism  splinter group  that oppose the peace process in Northern Ireland and  who see anybody  who has turned away from violence as some kind of  sell-out or &ldquo;Judas&rdquo;,  as one of Stokes&rsquo; most hardcore mates put it a  while back.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">That  mate was Alan Ryan, who is now dead. As he  walked through the streets of  north Dublin on 3 September, Ryan was  shot in the body, the legs and  the head by a masked gunman. Ryan was  the Real IRA&rsquo;s leader in Dublin, a  person who had done four years in  prison for his association with  terrorism. He was one of the most  feared crime overlords in the Irish  capital, believed to be responsible  for ordering the death of three of  his enemies in an ongoing drugs  war. Earlier this year he personally  used a hacksaw to cut off the  fingers of a criminal who had refused to  pay him protection money. Five  months before he met his end, somebody  had tried to kill Ryan while he  sat in the pub owned by Stokes&rsquo; father,  John.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">On the day of his  funeral, Stokes tweeted about his mate.  &ldquo;Thinking of you Alan,&rdquo; he  said. The funeral became a circus with men in  balaclavas and full  paramilitary regalia complete with a volley of  gunshots as his coffin  left his home on the north of the city. Police  officers had the place  surrounded. The media were there in big numbers.  Ryan was a  high-profile gangster and his death was national news in  Ireland.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">A  few weeks back, Stokes went to Dublin to attend a  fundraiser for Ryan,  an event that police had under surveillance given  some of the people  that went through the door that night. Last weekend, a  female reporter  in Ireland, who has bravely covered the Ryan story for  some time, wrote  about the fundraiser and the fact that Stokes attended  it. During the  week she received two death threats after some of Ryan&rsquo;s  sympathisers  put her mobile phone number and other personal details on a  website set  up as a memorial to Ryan.The threat was not idle. In 1996,  the  fearless Sunday Independent crime reporter Veronica Guerin was shot   dead in her car by a crime gang, an event that scandalised the nation   and made it aware, too late, that the gangland figures in Dublin were   lawless beyond anything anybody ever dared to imagine. So, when those   death threats were issued last week, a Garda patrol car with armed   detectives was immediately placed outside the journalist&rsquo;s home.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">On   Friday, Celtic said they take a very dim view of Stokes&rsquo; attendance at   the fundraiser and that they will deal with it internally.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Officially,   they would say no more about it but we can take it as fact that the   striker&rsquo;s activities have gone down badly at Celtic Park. By rights,   they should sack him. He has disgraced his club.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Some might say   that is harsh, given that one glance at Stokes&rsquo; twitter feed shows an   exchange with a bloke who says he hopes the UVF put a bullet in the   footballer&rsquo;s head sometime soon. But this is the world Stokes lives in   and this is the treatment &ndash; utterly abhorrent and demanding of police   intervention &ndash; that he has opened himself up to. Stokes&rsquo; abuser should   be found and put away but what the hell was the player doing at the   fundraiser in the first place?</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">His supporters would, no doubt,   argue that he was just honouring the memory of somebody he has known   since he was a kid, that it doesn&rsquo;t follow that he supported Ryan in his   vermin deeds and that a friend is a friend.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">It&rsquo;s true that   Stokes was born into this, that connections to people in the underworld   were part of his natural life since before he even knew how to spell  the  word and that it must be hard to extricate yourself from that life.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">But has he even tried?</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">There is no evidence in anything that he has ever said that points to an awareness of a need to move on from these people.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">There   is a feeling that Lennon would like to say a whole lot more about this   but feels, for various reasons, that he cannot. At least not yet.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">There   is no question but that the Celtic manager will be horrified to hear   about the death threats issued to the journalist given that Lennon   himself has, sadly, suffered in a similar way.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">The club&rsquo;s   reluctance to speak out publicly should not be taken as an endorsement   of Stokes but, to the watching public, it might well look that way and   nobody could be criticised for thinking that Celtic have not reacted as   they should have.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Again, we say: Not yet. There is a hope that they will have plenty to say in time.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">You can contextualise it all you like, you can look into Stokes&rsquo; family upbringing and say: &lsquo;Look, he never stood a chance.&rsquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">But   the fact remains that a Celtic player was fraternising with crime   bosses suspected of multiple murders who also had well-known links to   terrorism and that the journalist who wrote about it first has been   targeted by these people and last week was being protected by armed   detectives camped outside her house. That&rsquo;s the beginning, the end and   the in-between of this saga.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Stokes has been injured all season but the damage to his ankle is as nothing compared to the damage to his reputation. </span></div><div class="body"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tbody><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tr><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></div><h3 class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></h3><div class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></div><h3 class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  Anthony Stokes &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t care&rsquo; what Lennon thinks</span><br></h3><div class="body"><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Anthony Stokes &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t care&rsquo; what Lennon thinks</span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">The Scotsman</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">By ANDREW SMITH</span><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Published on Saturday 16 March 2013 00:00</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">THE   subject of falling foul of his manager during a troubled season for   Anthony Stokes might have been expected to elicit either contrition or   evasion from the Celtic striker.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">The 24-year-old simply isn&rsquo;t   that type, however. In December, he was accused of &ldquo;tarnishing&rdquo; the club   by Neil Lennon through his appearance at a Dublin fundraiser in honour   of childhood acquaintance and murdered leading Real IRA figure Alan   Ryan. That same month, there were questions raised over the attitude and   professionalism of Stokes during his rehabilitation following an ankle   operation that cost him the first six months of this campaign.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Yet   asked if it hurt when Lennon criticised him, Stokes offered candidly:   &ldquo;No, not really. Listen, I don&rsquo;t really care what the gaffer thinks of   me personally. It would be nice to get on with him &ndash; and I think I have  a  good relationship with him. But I only really care about how I do on   the pitch for him. That&rsquo;s where I should be judged, on the pitch.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;I   get on reasonably well with him. We&rsquo;re not best mates but I don&rsquo;t  think  he hates me either. It&rsquo;s a normal player-manager relationship. I  don&rsquo;t  care what other people think about me. Since I&rsquo;ve been in the SPL  I&rsquo;ve  always managed to score around 20 goals a season. If I&rsquo;m playing  every  week I can hit 25 to 30. Unfortunately in the last couple of  years I  haven&rsquo;t played every week. As a striker, I should be judged  purely on  goals and assists.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">A judgment will be made about the  Irishman in  the next couple of months that will shape his entire  future. When the  player signed from Hibernian for &pound;800,000, he agreed a  four-year  contract, the final year of which came in the form of an  option that  Celtic alone can decide whether to exercise or not.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Stokes,  who  has harvested 44 goals from 90 appearances &ndash; all the more  impressive  considering only 63 of these were starts &ndash; appears  philosophical about  his situation. He would have ample justification  for feeling that,  regardless of any off-field issues, he has proved too  valuable to simply  discard.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ll be here  next season and for the  foreseeable future,&rdquo; Stokes said. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll  have to play it by ear and  wait to see what happens. There have been  brief conversations about a  contract but we haven&rsquo;t gone into details  yet. I hope it will be sorted  before the end of the season. It would  hurt to leave here [as it&rsquo;s my  boyhood club]. It would sting for a  while but it&rsquo;s football. It happens  with managers and players every  week. You move on but I hope that&rsquo;s not  the case with me here. The club  have the one-year option but I&rsquo;d rather  sign a contract for longer.  Any footballer will tell you it&rsquo;s nice to  have a bit of security and  feel settled.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Stokes has been  settling in to regular first-team  action again since his return to full  fitness in the middle of  January. With mixed results, he feels, having  bagged four goals from 11  appearances. &ldquo;When I look back on this season,  I&rsquo;ll see it as a  difficult one no matter how many goals I score between  now and the end.  Purely because of the injury,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was happy  with my form in  the first couple of games back but I need to lift it  again now. If I&rsquo;m  not scoring goals I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m doing my job.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Meanwhile,   Craig Brown, manager of today&rsquo;s opponents, Aberdeen, does not believe   his retirement announcement this week will have any impact on his   players during their final attempts to make the top six of the SPL.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Brown   revealed on Thursday that he would step down as Dons manager at the  end  of the season but there remain eight games left in the SPL, with  the  next three crucial.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Aberdeen travel to Celtic Park today in  ninth  place in the SPL with games against Hearts and Dundee United to  follow.

Picture: AFP/Getty Images  </span><font color="#0066cc"><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br></font><span class="diffAdd">David GunnMar 2018</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Anthony Stokes was a more talented footballer than Robbie Keane during his  formative years, according to a leading Irish schoolboy coach. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">John Bolger, who has spent more than 20 years helping to develop fledgling  players at clubs in the Dublin District Schoolboy League, spoke to Irish website  </span><a href="https://www.the42.ie/john-bolger-interview-irish-football-schoolboy-coach-3908660-Mar2018/" target="_self"><font color="#0066cc"><span class="diffAdd">the42.ie</span></font></a><span class="diffAdd"> about a handful of players who made the step  up from the League of Ireland and abroad - including Stokes; former Hibs striker  Eoin Doyle; ex-Celtic and Hibs midfielder Richie Towell; Gavin Gunning, who had  two spells with Dundee United and Motherwell, and Inverness Caledonian Thistle&rsquo;s  Aaron Doran.  </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Bolger started off with Kilnamanagh in the Dublin suburb of Tallaght, before  joining Cherry Orchard - former club of Conor Sammon, Jonny Hayes, Willo Flood  and Jon Daly. After six years with the Ballyfermot side, Bolger joined  Shelbourne, where he took over an Under-11s team packed with talented youngsters  including Stokes and Doyle. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Hailing the team as the &ldquo;best side I&rsquo;ve ever been involved with,&rdquo; Bolger  added: &ldquo;They were unbeaten in the league for five years.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Stokes was the star player in the side, and by the age of 15 had joined  Arsenal, but despite being highly-rated by Gunners boss Arsene Wenger, and  catching the eye during a loan spell at Falkirk, Stokes made just one first team  appearance before joining Sunderland for &pound;2 million in 2007.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">He had loan spells at Sheffield United and Crystal Palace, before joining  Hibs and reuniting with John Hughes, who had been his manager at Falkirk.  </span><br><span class="diffAdd">A six-year stint at Celtic followed, as well as two more spells with Hibs and  a brief period at Blackburn Rovers. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">The 29-year-old is currently at Greek outfit Apollon Smyrni but despite his  promise as a youth, has been capped just nine times by the Republic of  Ireland. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Stokesy was the most talented teenager to come out of this country -  absolutely,&rdquo; Bolger told the42.ie website. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;He obviously didn&rsquo;t achieve anywhere near as much as Robbie Keane, but he  was a more talented player. He had two great feet, he was a superb header of the  ball and he had a brilliant football brain too.&rdquo; </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Claiming that Stokes netted between 50 and 60 goals every season as a  schoolboy, Bolger added: &ldquo;There are so many boxes you have to tick. It&rsquo;s not  about just having [the skill], you&rsquo;ve got to have that fire in your belly.&ldquo;You have to want to be a footballer, be prepared to listen, and take things  on board.&rdquo; </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Stokes, who joined Hibs for a third spell last summer, left Hibs by mutual  consent in January after twice falling foul of manager Neil Lennon.  </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Speaking after his exit, Lennon said: &ldquo;There is a line that I won&rsquo;t tolerate,  and Anthony had plenty of chances not to cross that line. </span><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been saying for years [that he&rsquo;s a talented player], and it&rsquo;s a shame,  but I can&rsquo;t keep rapping him on the knuckles and saying it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo; </span><br><span class="diffAdd">Stokes has played three matches for Apollon Smyrni, but is yet to score. The  Athens-based side currently sit second bottom of the Greek top flight.</span><h3 class="body"><br></h3><div class="body"></div><div class="body"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tbody><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tr><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></div><h3 class="body"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><div><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><img alt="" height="1" src="http://stats.independent.ie/eae-logger/Logger?clientDT=1306311805251&rt=1&objId=2527445&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.ie%2Ftemplate%2Fver1-0%2Fwireframe%2FwfPrint.jsp&type=article_print&pubId=67443&ctxId=1372&cat=&meta=&title=Anthony+Stokes%3A+%2527It%2527s+been+a+while%2C+but+I+really+want+to+play+for+my+country%2527&" width="1"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tbody><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><tr><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span></h3></div><br><br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></div>
