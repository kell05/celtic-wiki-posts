Boasting almost fifty years&rsquo; participation at the highest  level of sport in this country, John Clark has accumulated most of the  rewards going in his chosen sport, and he played a major part in placing  his team on the world footballing map. <br><br>His club office is a  remarkable room. After an exchanging of handshakes, he abruptly  apologises for the strong stench of leather that clogs up the air,  wafting from the boxes of brand new footballs and columns of boots,  which line the walls. Four colossal cupboards resemble the kind of  high-security vaults that may be found in a bank. These cupboards are  jammed full with what seems like an endless amount of shorts, socks,  jerseys, jumpers and jackets. <br><br>After a quick guide of the  surroundings, he offers a cup of tea. No longer than five minutes later a  platter of tea and toast arrives at the door. As one of the best  defenders in the country in his day, you can be sure that he hasn&rsquo;t  treated all the visitors who have come to his football club with the  same hospitality throughout his football career. <br><br>A local lad  hailing from North Lanarkshire, John Clark is best known as being one of  the few Scottish owners of a European Cup medal, which he won as part  of the legendary Celtic team who overcame Inter Milan in Lisbon on the  25th May 1967 to become the first British club to claim the trophy. <br><br>Following  his retirement from football, Clark moved into the managerial side of  the game, taking control of Cowdenbeath, Stranraer and Clyde, before  returning to Celtic to take up his current role as kit man. Now at  sixty-six years-old, he still bursts with as much energy at the club he  supported as a youngster as he did when he was a player all those years  ago, back in the heart of the action.Clark explains that football  was his only vice as a youngster. Due to the fact that there was no  frequent bus service from North Lanarkshire to Glasgow, Clark was unable  to attend many first-class football matches, especially to watch  Celtic, his boyhood team.<br><br>&ldquo;When you were young in my time it was  either boxing or football. I came from a mining village called  Chapelhall. Football was at the centre of my life when I was growing  up, I played for as many hours as daylight would allow. I started  playing at my local school and then my local boys club Larkhall  Thistle.&rdquo;<br><br>At seventeen years of age, many teenagers have yet to  begin planning their lives or career paths. In 1958, a  seventeen-year-old John Clark was approached by the same club that  employed his boyhood heroes to sign him as a player. &ldquo;I was fortunate  enough that Celtic approached me to sign for the club. I was seventeen  at the time and I felt as though I had won the pools!&rdquo; exclaims the  living legend.<br><br>However, as is the case in life, signing on the  dotted line did not mean Clark was ensured a place amongst the 11 men  who emerged from the tunnel at Celtic park week-after-week. &ldquo;At  the beginning when I moved to a big club like Celtic it was hard. There  were a lot of good players of my own age along with some professional  players at international level, so I had to put the work in and  eventually I made it into the team.&rdquo;<br><br>Lucky enough to be taken  under the wing of one of this country&rsquo;s greatest ever managers, Jock  Stein, Clark believes that the successes of arguably the most  outstanding Celtic team of all time are down to the advanced tactical  nature of his biggest influence. According to the kit man, it was  special relationship that started at youth level, between Jock Stein and  his players, which helped to bring about such unprecedented success.<br><br>&ldquo;The  person who influenced me most was Jock Stein. Before he left Celtic to  go to Dunfermline and Hibs he was in charge of youth and reserve  football at Celtic. He had a knowledge of the youth players in the team  before he left and when he came back in 1965, we had experienced and  progressed in first team football while he had progressed as a manager&rdquo;Indeed,  Clark believes that along with a sense of unity within a team who had  originated from within a 30-mile radius of the club, the successes of  the famous Celtic team were down to the coaching ability and awareness  of Stein. <br><br>&ldquo;Jock Stein was a thinking man.&rdquo; Clark recollects, &ldquo;He  was miles ahead of the situation at the time. I see training situations  out on the training pitch now; Jock Stein was doing the same thing forty  years ago. They have broken it all down into programmes whereas we  would do it in block. The man was ahead of himself. <br><br>He went to Italy to  study some training methods and eventually people were coming to Celtic  park to study Jock&rsquo;s training techniques.&rdquo;<br><br>Handed the role of  sweeper by Stein, Clark played a pivotal role in the backbone of the  Celtic line-up. A large amount of defensive responsibility lay on his  shoulders in the lead up to their European Cup victory in 1967. <br><br>A  tour to North America, the first of its kind for Celtic, in the summer  of 1966 played a crucial role in the gelling of the team. Clark believes  that the tour played a central role in the outstanding season the team  had when they returned. &ldquo;Naturally when you are away for 6 weeks, the  team bonded. There was a sense of togetherness within the team. It was  the start of big things for Celtic.&rdquo; <br><br>The tour also gave Jock  Stein the chance to perfect his Celtic team, and the manager&rsquo;s thinking  paid off. During the 1966-1967 season, Celtic won the League  championship, Scottish Cup, League Cup, Glasgow Cup, and of course the  European Cup in a distinctive year for the Glasgow club. Not only did  they have a clean-sweep of victories on home soil, they also won the  most sought-after trophy in European club football. <br><br>&ldquo;I remember  it was a really warm day. The whole setting was ideal, it was just as if  a film was being made, we were going to win and everything was just  right&rdquo; Clark recollects of the infamous summers day in Lisbon. <br><br>&ldquo;There  was a fantastic crowd all around the stadium when we came out, the  whole arena looked as if it was bedecked in green and white. Celtic  played really well that day. If people are being honest about it, the  Inter Milan goalkeeper saved them from getting a real punishment with  regards to goals&rdquo;<br><br>The 1966-67 season brought an abundance of  silverware to John Clark, but it also brought his first International  cap. In the early summer, before a Celtic tour to America, Clark pulled  on the navy blue jersey for the first time in his career. Aged 25, Clark  was arguably at the peak of his career. <br><br>And it was a special  occasion for the defender, against one of the best teams in the world,  featuring one of the most outstanding footballers of all time &ldquo;My first  international was against a Brazil team which featured Pel&eacute; &ndash; he was the  king. The fact I was playing against him almost took my mind off the  game, but I managed to stay focused and we drew 1-1&rdquo; he recalls. <br><br>The  pinnacle of a somewhat outstanding playing career for Clark obviously  involves lifting the European Cup in 1967, but while reminiscing, he  places his life into perspective. Although he may have achieved the  pinnacle of European football, he stands by the elation of being  accepted into top-flight football as a teenager as an overwhelming  feeling. <br><br>&ldquo;If the highlight of your career when you&rsquo;re a  footballer is to win, then it was the 1967 European Cup victory. But  when you&rsquo;re a young boy and the opportunity arises to play for a club  you have always supported then that&rsquo;s a big thing as well.&rdquo;<br><br>John  Clark has played against the best, worked alongside the best, and been  managed by the best. But how does a sportsperson with so many years of  experience and success translate winning? &ldquo;The drive to be successful,&rdquo;  he ponders. &ldquo;If you want to be a success at any level you need to strive  towards goals. You need to make sacrifices&rdquo;<br><br>His passion for the  sport is evident from his occupations, which have all been based around  football. &ldquo;Next year, if all goes to plan, I will have been 50 years in  football. In some way or another it has been connected with Celtic&rdquo;<br><br>It  has connotations of a romantic tale. A boy who was approached to sign  for the club he adored. He was a teenager who matured into a Celtic  team that has been carved into the annals of Scottish and European  football. <br><br>Forty years later he is a man with fond memories of a euphoric playing career, and he is still infatuated with the sport.<br><br>Having  experienced one of Scotland&rsquo;s greatest sporting club successes, John  Clark progressed from a boy with an ambition, to a man, one of only  eleven, who can call himself a Lisbon Lion.<br><br>&copy; Copyright In The Winning Zone, MMVII, All Rights Reserved</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic lion John Clark opens heart on men behind 20-year final jinx 	 	</h3><div> 	 	 	Mar 14 2009 	 	 	Gordon Parks <br>Daily Record<br><br> 	 	JOHN CLARK claimed yesterday was Black Friday it was his 68th birthday and almost 50 years since he first walked into Parkhead. <br><br> 	 It may have been March 13 but the omens ahead of tomorrow&#39;s Co-operative  Insurance Cup Final should have Rangers fans dialling 999 for murder as  they get the 20-year itch. <br><br> 	 The former Lisbon Lion celebrated Scottish Cup triumphs over the Ibrox  side in 1969 and 1989 and is now gearing up for a Super Sunday he number  nine comes back to haunt their Old Firm rivals once again coach, After  half a century as a player, coach, assistant boss and now kitman at the  club, few have been closer to the men in charge of the East End giants. <br><br> 	 Since starting off as a player Under Jock Stein, Clark has been employed  as a valued member of the backroom team under the likes of Martin  O&#39;Neill and Gordon Strachan. <br><br> 	 His reputation as an astute football observer has provided an educated  ear to them all and he says those critical of his current gaffer will  change their tune in future. <br><br> 	 Stein and O&#39;Neill enjoy legendary status among the Parkhead followers  but Clark insists Strachan is cut from the same cloth but will only  receive praise in years to come. <br><br> 	 He said: &quot;Every player has their superstitions but we beat Rangers in  the Scottish Cup Final in1969 when I played for Jock and Billy won the  same trophy in 1989. The signs are we should win the League Cup this  year under Gordon. <br><br> 	 &quot;Big Billy was the same as Jock in that they were both winners who demanded that quality from their players. <br><br> 	 &quot;Billy wanted to be the best and his players to do their best. His  record will show he was a leader both as a player and a manager. <br><br> 	 &quot;Gordon Strachan is also thorough but lays things out simply for the  players. I know he&#39;s not to everyone&#39;s fancy but there will always be an  element of the support who will never take to him.. <br><br> 	 &quot;Maybe it will take seven or eight years after he&#39;s gone for people to  realise what he&#39;s achieved. People have a habit of only appreciating  what they have after it&#39;s gone. <br><br> 	 &quot;If you ask fans 20 years from now what they think of Gordon they may well have a different opinion to the one they hold now.&quot; <br><br> 	 Clark is careful not to be critical of the current playing staff at  Parkhead but admits a degree of sympathy for Strachan who&#39;s been forced  to operate with a quality of personnel which doesn&#39;t compare to talents  of the past. <br><br> 	 He added:&quot;The managers I&#39;ve worked with all have their own style but at the end of the day you need the material to work with. <br><br> 	 &quot;If you have the best players you can have the best team but sometimes  you need to work with what you have and try to make a blend from that. <br><br> 	 &quot;If there is a Henrik Larsson, Lubomir Moravcik or Chris Sutton out  there at the moment I wish Celtic would get a hold of him. We would be  delighted to have that kind of player here again.  	 &quot;If the supporters thought the likes of Henrik would come back the stadium wouldn&#39;t be big enough. <br><br> 	 &quot;There is a diamond out there somewhere but someone needs to find him.&quot; <br><br> 	 The previous two Old Firm games have been slammed as non-events but  Clark is adamant that the sold-out signs outside Hampden are evidence of  the unique attraction of a game that will never lose its appeal. <br><br> 	 He said: &quot;The Old Firm game is the most competitive game in the world of club football, which makes it unique. <br><br> 	 &quot;Nothing has ever compared to it and you can look at domestic games in  Brazil, Spain, Italy or down south - there&#39;s nothing like it. <br><br> 	 &quot;I look at Manchester United&#39;s game with Liverpool this weekend and it doesn&#39;t even come close.&quot; <br><br> 	 Despite having passionate beliefs about how the game should be played,  there is no danger of Clark offering Strachan any advice as the clock  ticks down to tomorrow&#39;s kick-off - he&#39;ll be too busy dreaming about  pulling the boots back on. <br><br> 	 He said: &quot;At Hampden on Sunday I will be wishing I could switch the  clock back and get that No.6 back on my shorts. I will just wish the  players good luck and get on with my job. <br><br> 	 &quot;I assess things in my own way as I&#39;ve been involved as a player and a  manager in games like these but I would never make a comment on what my  thoughts are on a game. <br><br> 	 &quot;That&#39;s the manager&#39;s area and I don&#39;t get involved in it. <br><br> 	 &quot;I&#39;ve watched men like Stein who was a winner and a very thorough man. <br><br> 	 He would have a run-down on the opposition&#39;s strengths and weaknesses and always demanded you gave your best. <br><br> 	 &quot;Jock was the man who kick-started this club and is rightly still regarded as a God among the support. <br><br> 	 &quot;He drummed it into us about the need to be focused before Old Firm  games and couldn&#39;t be bothered with all the palaver before the game - he  just wanted to hear the first whistle. <br><br> 	 &quot;All the talk in the world means nothing if a player listens to a  manager minutes before the game and doesn&#39;t go out there and get  switched on right away. <br><br> 	 &quot;It&#39;s vital to get the upper hand from the word go. It&#39;s so important to  show who&#39;s boss and make an impression where it counts - in the middle  of the park.  	 &quot;If the guys there can get control early on it gives the rest of the players a chance to get going. <br><br> 	 &quot;Even Walter Smith and the people who&#39;ve gone before him will tell you that you must gain the upper hand right away. <br><br> 	 &quot;If we do, and I am allowed to be biased, I believe we will win by the odd goal in three.&quot;  	  	 	</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic&#39;s legendary kit man</h3><div class="standfirst">Lisbon Lion John Clark reveals the secrets of the boot room... and the laundry</div>4-4-2 magazine<br><br><div>Once concerned only with remembering to bring along  11 outfield kits and a goalie shirt, the role of the kit man has  changed dramatically in modern football thanks to third strips,  customised boots and snoods.

Deep inside the bowels of Celtic Park, between the boot  room and the green room, the lifelong Hoops supporter signed for the  club in the company of then reserve coach, Jock Stein. <br><br>Since  that moment, Clark has spent the greater part of 53 years in the service  of Celtic. Only the likes of Willie Maley can boast a longer  association with the club. <br><br>During a success-laden 13 years as a  player, he made over 300 appearances for the Hoops. And his partnership  with Billy McNeill in central-defence was the cornerstone of the  greatest ever Celtic side, which dominated domestic football and won the  European Cup in 1967. <br><br>After calling time on his playing career,  Clark returned to Celtic several times, working in nearly every  backroom role, including assistant manager, coach and his current  position, kitman. <br><br>This month, the Celtic great turned 70.  Typically, he spent it on Celtic duty, travelling to and from the  postponed match in Inverness &ndash; although he did eventually celebrate  belatedly with his family. <br><br>To mark the occasion, the View sat  down with the Celtic great at Lennoxtown for an exclusive interview,  reflecting on some of his many highlights as a player and on the  backroom staff.<br><br>You signed for Celtic in 1958 and have retained a  connection with the club for the best part of 50 years as a player,  coach, assistant manager and now kitman. Does that make you feel proud? <br>It  turned out to be a good day but I never imagined I would still be here.  Football is not the most secure job, as you could be good but people  might not fancy you as a player and you could move on. Still, being here  at this time in your life makes you feel very grateful and I am still  fortunate that I am still able to do a job.<br><br>Celtic have been a huge part of your life for so many years. What does the club mean to you? <br>It&rsquo;s  printed all over my forehead here and down my back! I have had a great  association with the club and been very fortunate that I have had good  career in football and good relationships with people among the  different jobs at the club. It&rsquo;s a difficult one to answer. I think I  have done every job at the club except manager: groundstaff, coaching,  assistant manager and now kitman. I have had a great career. My life  revolves around Celtic. Let&rsquo;s say the two of us go together. The club  has been brilliant to me but I think I have given a lot back to the club  as well. <br><br>What was your earliest memory of watching Celtic? <br>The  first major game I first saw Celtic was against Clyde at Hampden in the  Scottish Cup final in 1955 - and Celtic lost the replay. When I left  school, the first game I can always remember was Celtic against  Manchester United at Celtic Park. It took place in the afternoon because  it was in our pre-floodlight days . I had just got a job, I can&rsquo;t  remember what it was, and it was my first day at work and I asked if I  could get away early. Luckily the guy was a Celtic supporter and let me  away, as you wouldn&rsquo;t get many people letting you away on your first day  in the job. So I managed to go and watch the Busby Babes. And the year  before I signed for Celtic I was on the Hampden terracing for the 7-1  game. Those are the games that stick out.<br><br>Do you still remember the day you joined your boyhood heroes from Larkhall Thistle? How did you feel?<br>Although  Jimmy McGory was the manager, it was Jock Stein who gave me the form to  sign. The places at Celtic Park are still the same. I signed it on a  Thursday night standing at the door where the green room goes into the  boot room. There was no-one with me so I just signed the form on my own.  And every time I walk in there, I can say well that&rsquo;s where it  happened. <br><br>With the team battling silverware at present, are you looking forward to the final few months of the season? <br>I  think we have a demanding finish to the end of the season and it&rsquo;s just  a case of being careful and staying focused on what we are doing and  making sure we are ready for it. We have players now that have made the  team good to watch. There is great atmosphere coming back into the  terracing which is important as the support are a massive part of the  club.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>John gave hero Pele shirt shrift</h3>By PHIL GORDON, The Sun<br>Published: 25th March 2011<br><br>JOHN  CLARK spent 90 minutes rubbing shoulders with Pele but had no intention  of asking the Brazilian legend for his famous No10 shirt.<br><br>For the former Celtic defender, Clark&rsquo;s own dark blue jersey was a prize to ensure he remembered his Scotland debut in 1966.<br><br>The  Lisbon Lion let his Hoops pal Stevie Chalmers &mdash; who netted Scotland&rsquo;s  goal in the 1-1 draw &mdash; swap shirts with Pele and put his Scotland one in  a bin bag in his loft for safe keeping.<br><br>But that move came back  to haunt Clark, when he opened up the bag after quitting the game to  discover his treasured mementoes had turned to dust.<br><br>His first  Scotland shirt, and others he&rsquo;d traded with Europe&rsquo;s stars during  Celtic&rsquo;s golden era, disintegrated due to a lack of air.<br><br>Clark said: &ldquo;All that was left was a collection of collars.<br><br>&ldquo;The shirts in those days were made of cotton, not like today&rsquo;s kit which can last forever.<br><br>&ldquo;I had put my Scotland top in the bin bag and tied it up tight and left it in the loft.<br><br>&ldquo;When I finished playing about seven years later, I went up there to look at the shirts and found they had just wasted away.<br><br>&ldquo;There were no air holes in the bag and I was told by someone in the trade a lack of oxygen disintegrated them.<br><br>&ldquo;It was not just my Scotland top.

Of  all the Lisbon Lions, he is probably the one whom we would come up with  last, a good deal below Johnstone and Murdoch, for example, and he  certainly was the first to lose his place (in 1968 to the excellent Jim  Brogan) after the triumph in Lisbon . Yet those of us who saw John Clark  in action saw a master craftsman, and we would certainly never  underestimate his value.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">So much of the &quot;underestimation&quot; of John  comes from his reserved and non-flamboyant nature (he was the very  antithesis, for example, of Tommy Gemmell or Jimmy Johnstone or Bertie  Auld) and his very position in the team where he was the sweeper-up  (hence his nickname, &quot;John The Brush&quot;). Sweepers tend to be quiet and  unobtrusive, and in such a fine team as Celtic were in those days, it  was very easy for spectators to sing how dominant McNeill was in the air  and on the ground and to forget that Billy&#39;s rare mistakes were often  covered for by &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It is less easy to explain why he was sometimes called &quot;Luggy&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">John  was born in 1941 in Chapelhall and joined Celtic in October 1958 as a  &quot;Kelly Kid&quot;. He made his first team debut at Arbroath about a year later  in October 1959 when Bertie Peacock was away playing for Ireland . He  impressed that day as Celtic won very comfortably, 5-0. It was not until  spring 1961 however that he began to push his way into the first team,  replacing the ageing Peacock. In a tense Scottish Cup Quarter Final  replay, John scored the extra time winner for Celtic against Hibs at  Easter Road (one of only three goals he scored in 318 appearances for  the Club!) and as a result he was preferred (perhaps unwisely) to  Peacock in the disastrous Scottish Cup Final and Replay against Jock  Stein&#39;s Dunfermline of that year.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">From 1961 until the arrival of  Stein, Clark played sporadically for Celtic, often out of position on  the right side of the park, but more often one of the few signs of  stability in an otherwise chaotic set up. He was out of favour in 1963  and thus missed the horrors of the Rangers Cup Finals of that year, but  1963-64 saw him coming into his own, although quite clearly on the wrong  side of the Clark, McNeill and Kennedy half back line.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Like with  many other players, the arrival of Stein in January 1965 was the moment  Clark &#39;s career took off. The team began to evolve to 4-2-4 from 2-3-5  and the defence became a &quot;flat back four&quot; of Craig, McNeill, Clark and  Gemmell. In this role Clark was superb, always on hand, always there to  help out, occasionally being seen to calm things down when Billy McNeill  got a little flustered, and generally playing his part in the greatest  football team that Scottish football has ever seen. Apart from his  Lisbon heroics, he won Scottish League medals in 1966, 1967 and 1968,  Scottish Cup medals in 1965 and 1967 and League Cup medals in  1965-6,1966-7,1967-8 and 1968-9.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Even when he had lost his place  in the team, John Clark was never far away from the action - either on  the bench or simply with the squad, talking to everyone, geeing them up  and impressing everyone with his vast knowledge of European and world  football. Stein was not unashamed to pick the brains of John Clark when  research was necessary on some European opponent.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He won 4 International caps for Scotland , one of them against Brazil in 1966, and never played badly for his country.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In  1971, John Clark moved to Morton where he finished his playing career.  He became a coach for Celtic in 1973, then when Billy McNeill became  Manager of Aberdeen in 1977, Billy took John there as his Assistant  before the irresistible call came for that management team from Celtic  Park the following year.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">John is thus rightly considered to be a  part of the 1979 4-2 League win over Rangers and the development of  talent like Charlie Nicholas and Tommy Burns. He has also been Manager  of Cowdenbeath, Stranraer and Clyde , but perhaps he lacked the flair  and charisma to be a Manager.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In recent years, he has been the  Kit Manager at Celtic, a job that he seems very happy with. He is after  all working for the Club that he loves and the Club that means so much  to him, and in whose history he played such a glorious part.</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  The enduring class of Celtic&#39;s &#39;Gentleman John&#39;</span></h3><br><span class="diffAdd">Graham Spiers</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Sports Columnist.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Monday 16 March 2015 </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It is time to wish &#39;Gentleman&#39; John Clark a belated happy birthday.</span><br><a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/the-enduring-class-of-celtics-gentleman-john.120806903" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffAdd">http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/the-enduring-class-of-celtics-gentleman-john.120806903</span></a><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The  Lisbon Lion turned 74 on Friday and can still be found at Lennoxtown  most days, helping out with the Celtic kit and encouraging the club&#39;s  development squad. A life of success and tragedy has shaped Clark,  though no-one quite knows where his unfailing modesty and courtesy  spring from.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">When Clark was 10 years old, and tearing around the  environs of Airdrie like any wee kid in the 1950s, terrible news was  wrought upon him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I remember the moment clearly, it was a  Saturday morning, just a few days before Christmas,&quot; he said. &quot;These two  policemen arrived at our door and I knew something was wrong. My father  was a railwayman and he&#39;d been away checking on faults down near  Watford. My mother took one look at these policemen and said to me,  &#39;John, go outside and play, would you?&#39; I went outside and then heard my  mother&#39;s cries from inside the house.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;My dad had been killed by  an onrushing train. He&#39;d been working on the tracks and a signal was  supposed to operate, but it never did. The train appeared from nowhere  and killed him instantly. It left my mother a widow, with two young  kids, and six months pregnant with another. I&#39;ll never forget that day.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Lisbon  in 1967 and being made a king of European football was still 16 years  away for Clark. From that tragic episode onwards, the wee Lanarkshire  kid would scrap and survive the hard way. Maybe not so amazingly, Clark  combined his gentleness of character with a tough-as-nails instinct to  survive.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;My life became pretty hard,&quot; he said. &quot;The family  earner was dead and I had to go out and get work. I got a job at a  pit-head in Airdrie, and I took another job helping a local farmer sell  eggs and potatoes around the area. There was no other option. My mother  needed the money. My dad&#39;s death taught me that life would be tough, and  that I had to keep going.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Further fate, of course, would turn  John Clark from a Lanarkshire waif into European footballing royalty. In  1958 Jock Stein was in charge of Celtic&#39;s reserves and he liked the  look of the wee, squat, determined sweeper he&#39;d seen playing for  Larkhall Thistle. Clark was signed up for Celtic aged 17 and, nine years  later, he became one of British football&#39;s immortals.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The  afternoon of May 25 1967, when Celtic beat Inter Milan 2-1 to win the  European Cup, is a moment cherished and handed down by generations of  Celtic supporters. Clark was sweeper beside Billy McNeill that day and,  without fuss, calmly saw off various Inter forays.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;We were an  incredibly confident bunch of guys,&quot; he says. &quot;We knew we could win it,  we had no fear of anything. We just fancied ourselves rotten. Inter were  meant to be the best club side in the world at the time but we thought  we&#39;d beat them. Even at half-time and 1-0 down, nobody panicked, no-one  thought anything negative. Big Jock told us nothing remarkable, he said,  &#39;just keep playing, you&#39;ll get there.&#39;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;We were ultra-confident  in our ability. We knew we had it in us. Looking back it sounds a wee  bit like arrogance. But we never believed we&#39;d be beaten that day in  Lisbon.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Clark was 26 at the time, but his Celtic career was soon  to be cut short. In fact, checking the record books, it is shocking to  see how soon he was displaced by the new, young talents coming through  at Celtic Park.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;Not long after Lisbon - maybe 18 months later - I  got a cartilage injury in my left knee which destroyed my career.  Nowadays you come back from these things in five minutes, but not back  then. I was out for nine months and when I came back my knee was never  the same again.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I remember the moment very clearly. Big Jock  used to send us here, there and everywhere to play, and we were at the  old Bayview playing against East Fife. The ball came to me in the box, I  turned away with it, and this guy just came right through me, the full  brunt of his weight on my knee.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;That was it for me. I was in and out of the team after that, but I was never the same again. The injury finished me.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It  is well-known in football how much John Clark deplored some of the fame  and celebrity that came his way. His daughter, Marie, an adult  education teacher, remembers how her modest father disliked the profile  that came with his football career.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;My dad is fundamentally a  shy man,&quot; she says. &quot;He never wanted the fame that came with playing for  Celtic and was never comfortable with it. At Celtic there were guys  like Billy [McNeill], Berti [Auld] and Jimmy Johnstone, but dad was not  outgoing like these guys.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;I remember sometimes as a wee kid I&#39;d  be out with him and someone would want his autograph. Of course, he  would give it, but it just wasn&#39;t in his nature. In his day the press  never attached themselves to my father because there was no story there.  He was just a family man who did his training and then went home.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Clark  himself says: &quot;I never wanted any of that [fame or celebrity]. It  wasn&#39;t me. I preferred being in the background. Big Jock used to say to  me, &#39;push yourself forward, be more up front.&#39; I just said, &#39;no thanks&#39;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&quot;But I&#39;ve no complaints. I had a great career and I&#39;ve got a great family. My life turned out to be very, very good.&quot;</span><br><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3><img align="bottom" alt="John Clark" height="800" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/1bdaff457fe27fa6ce6d0922a16df8bd/GW608H800" title="John Clark" width="608"><span class="diffAdd">   </span><br><br><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">John Clark: Five games that changed my life 				 				</span></h3><div class="newsInfo"><span class="diffAdd"> 					By: Mark Henderson on 27 Mar, 2016 09:59</span><br><span class="diffAdd">http://www.celticfc.net/news/10244</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd"> 					</span><div class="newsShare"><span class="diffAdd"> 						 						 						 						 						 						 					</span></div><span class="diffAdd"> 					 				</span></div><span class="diffAdd"> 			 				                 			 					</span><div class="rtearea"><span class="diffAdd">WHEN  you have won an incredible silverware  haul which includes three league  titles, three Scottish Cups, four  League Cups and the most prestigious  trophy of them all, the European  Cup, selecting five games that were  particularly memorable is a tough  ask.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">  Besides, every one of  the 316 games that John Clark pulled on his beloved green-and-white  Hoops was a special moment for him.   Signed by Celtic in 1958, Clark  came  through the ranks to become a defensive lynchpin of Jock Stein&rsquo;s  side  during the most successful period in the club&rsquo;s history, the  highlight  of which was European Cup triumph over Inter Milan in 1967.   After his playing career ended, the  Lisbon Lion has held a variety of  positions in Paradise and he remains a  key figure behind the scenes to  the present day as the club&rsquo;s kit  manager, meaning he has been  associated with club for nearly 60 years.  A wonderful servant to  Celtic, he remains a revered figure among  supporters who will always  consider him as one of the club&rsquo;s all-time  greats.  </span><br><b><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic 2-2 Manchester United, April 16, 1956 (Celtic Park)</span></b><br><span class="diffAdd">  Celtic were playing Manchester United in a friendly game and, although   there were a number of cracking players involved, I just wanted to go   and see Duncan Edwards play. It was the time there were industrial   strikes so the game had to be played in the afternoon during the week. I   hadn&rsquo;t signed for Celtic yet and had just started working in the   railways that day. My Father had got killed in the railways so I got a   job in the signal box at Motherwell. I can always remember asking the   guy if I could get away early. He said to me, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve just started   today&rsquo;, but fortunately enough he was a Celtic supporter as well and let   me away. I stood in the old Rangers End and watched the game, which I   thoroughly enjoyed. Duncan Edwards was the king in that Busby team and I   was desperate to see him. He was a big powerful player and   unfortunately the Munich Disaster came along and he lost his life.  </span><br><br><b><span class="diffAdd">Arbroath 0-5 Celtic, October 3, 1959 (Gayfield)</span></b><br><span class="diffAdd">  Your first game for Celtic must be up there as a big highlight We  played  up in Arbroath and won 5-0. It was international week so Bertie  Peacock  and Bobby Evans were away and Billy McNeill and myself came in   alongside one or two others. I was a Celtic supporter and I had the   honour of being picked to sign for Celtic and then it was a big moment   in my life to play my first game. The reserves were under Jock Stein   back then and he must have been asked who he would have liked to have   been pushed forward, so that was a big occasion. Your first game for   Celtic is a really proud time as it means you have a chance to get on in   your life and my career blossomed from there.  </span><br><br><b><span class="diffAdd">Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, May 25, 1967 (Estadio Nacional)</span></b><br><span class="diffAdd">  Naturally this is the highlight of anyone&rsquo;s career and number one in my   life. You will never forget as people don&rsquo;t let you forget about it as   you walk on the street and you still get people talking to you about  it.  If people make the effort to talk to you about it you have to reply   properly and be courteous about it. It&rsquo;s not the players who keep   talking about Lisbon. We are all down-to-earth people and don&rsquo;t go about   shouting our mouth off about Lisbon. It&rsquo;s people who want to talk to  us  about it. Celtic supporters are proud of what happened in Lisbon. I   read recently in the paper that Mazzola wishes they could turn the  clock  back and play the game again as they were told we were a mediocre  team  and those words were rammed down their throats as we certainly  weren&rsquo;t  that. But he showed us respect that he admitted they were  beaten by the  better team. When Mazzola is still talking about the  game, it shows they  are still hurting from it and it must have hit them  hard. It took them a  while to recover from it as they drifted away for  a wee while. Herrera  and his catenaccio style were going great guns  and they were the  dominant team in Europe, but then along came Celtic.   </span><br><br><b><span class="diffAdd">Celtic 2-0 AC Milan, June 1, 1968 (CNE Stadium, Toronto)</span></b><br><span class="diffAdd">  Although this was a friendly, this was a high prestige game over in   Toronto for a tournament called the Champions Cup. It was the biggest   crowd in North America for a &lsquo;soccer&rsquo; match as they called it. There   were over 30,000 at it and we won 2-0. The Italians were really up for   it but we stood up to the challenge and triumphed. It was a really good   game. It may have been a friendly in name but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t on  the  field. It was a top-level game. The pace was unbelievable and it  was an  even contest for a while but we went on to 2-0. Italian teams  were  always desperate to beat you but we came through it. It just shows  you  that when it came to a challenge we were there and all the players  would  stand up to it.  </span><br><br><b><span class="diffAdd">Celtic 3-0 Benfica, November 26, 1969 (Celtic Park)</span></b><br><span class="diffAdd">  This was a really big game for me as Benfica had class acts in their   team &ndash; Coluna, Simoes, Torres and above all, the top cookie, Eusebio.   You want to play against the biggest names and Eusebio was among the   likes of Pele, Bobby Charlton, Denis Law, George Best and Jimmy Greaves,   players that I also came up against. That was a big highlight in my   life and a standout game that I thoroughly enjoyed. It was just the team   that Benfica had. They had so many class acts and the king of that  era,  Eusebio. They were a really top team, with good footballers but  they  also had a hardness about them in certain positions. I felt it was  a  great game. </span></div><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">  John Clark</span></h3><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3"><span class="diffAdd"> http://www.celticfc.net/news/5565</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> By: Joe Sullivan on 13 Mar, 2017 15:31</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  LISBON LION, John Clark celebrates his 76th birthday today, Monday,  March 13 and it goes without saying that everyone here at Celtic Park  wishes him many happy returns.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> One way of assessing a player&rsquo;s  career is to count his medals, and a brief glimpse at John Clark&rsquo;s  collection on display in the Paradise boardroom pays tribute to his  service to Celtic Football Club.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Among the main honours from  the 316 games he played for Celtic are three championship medals, three  for the Scottish Cup, four for the League Cup and, of course, there is  the pinnacle of the European Cup in 1967.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> However, that is only  part of the story as John Clark is still very much part of the fabric  of the club nearly 58 years after he first joined as a fresh-faced  teenager in 1958 and he has held a host of positions with the Hoops.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  He was Billy McNeill&rsquo;s partner in defence during the most successful  period in the club&rsquo;s history and, as one of the revered Lisbon Lions, he  will forever hold a place in the hearts of the faithful as one of the  club&rsquo;s greatest ever players.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> And when Cesar returned as  manager, it was John who he turned to as his right-hand man to help  steer the Hoops to more silverware as a new generation of supporters  looked for success. Today he remains a popular presence at both Celtic  Park and Lennoxtown, still enjoying every Hoops success because he is  still as much a Celtic supporter as he was when he cheered on the  players from the terracing in the 1950s. </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Here we look at some highlights from his amazing career.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd">  Amazingly, five was the paltry sum of Scotland caps that John Clark  received for his efforts as the most successful sweeper in the Scottish  game. Like the rest of the Lions, John discovered that talent and  achievement at club level mattered little to national team selectors.  However, players and supporters recognised his ability and years after  marking Pele out of the game in a 1-1 draw with Brazil in 1966, the  &lsquo;world&rsquo;s greatest player&rsquo; made a beeline for &lsquo;Luggy&rsquo;, stopping for a  chat after spotting him in the lobby of a New York hotel.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> There  were three nicknames that John picked up in his more than 50 years at  Celtic Park. The first is &lsquo;The Brush&rsquo;, the moniker that was given to him  in the newspapers, for his ability to calmly sweep up at the back. The  next was &lsquo;Luggy&rsquo;, the name that John doesn&rsquo;t really like and was picked  up after he ended up with a cauliflower ear after an accidental  collision with Billy McNeill in training. The third is the one that he  prefers to be known by and is best known as today, &lsquo;Clarky&rsquo;. As Clarky  himself pointed out in an interview, he has been called a few other  things over the years, mainly by his former assistant, Angie Thomson,  but &lsquo;none of them are printable!&rsquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He won an impressive 11  medals during his years as a player at Celtic Park. Between 1958 and  1971 he won three league championships, three Scottish Cups, four League  Cups and, of course, the European Cup in 1967. It should also be  remembered that John has also played a significant role in the backdrop  during other major triumphs, as a coach between 1973 and 1978, assistant  manager between 1978 and 1983 before returning to the club as kit  controller in 1997. All of his medals are on display in the Celtic  boardroom. &ldquo;I feel really honoured that they are on display there and  that supporters are able to see them,&rdquo; he said.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> A total of four  was the number of goals that the &lsquo;prolific&rsquo; John Clark scored for  Celtic &ndash; three in the green and white Hoops and one in the blue and  white hoops of Morton. Raise this issue with Clarky today and he will  rightly point out that he was a sweeper, more accustomed to stopping  goals than foraging forward. And he&rsquo;ll also tell you that he scored one  of the strikes of the century! &ldquo;I always say that I scored the best goal  ever,&rdquo; he said in a Celtic View interview. &ldquo;It was in a Scottish Cup  replay at Easter Road against Hibs and I beat a defender at the byline,  cut in and poked the ball through Ronnie Simpson&rsquo;s legs and said to him:  &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get any better than that could you!&rsquo;&rdquo; There was one other  memorable strike, though, and when John returned in 1971 as a Morton  player, he was among the Celtic goalscorers, netting an own goal in the  3-1 defeat.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Working as a player, coach and kit controller, John  has now spent seven decades at the club. It is a remarkable, almost  lifelong, association and one that Clark treasures. &ldquo;I was a Celtic  supporter, a Celtic player, it&rsquo;s been my life,&rdquo; he said in a matchday  programme interview. &ldquo;I get a lot of satisfaction when I think that I  started my working life with Celtic and I&rsquo;ll finish it with them. I&rsquo;ve  really enjoyed my life, when I look back I couldn&rsquo;t ask for any more.  I&rsquo;ve been a really lucky guy. &ldquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He played a total of 140  consecutive matches between April 1965 and September 1967. He did not  miss a single match during that two-year period &ndash; the most successful  period in the club&rsquo;s history - playing in every friendly match for the  club, including the North American Tour that preceded the clean sweep  season of 1966/67, the head-to-head with Manchester United and the great  Alfredo Di Stefano&rsquo;s testimonial. The run also included four  internationals with Scotland and continued until September 27, 1967,  when he was rested for the League Cup quarter-final against Ayr United.  John was back in the team for a league win over Stirling Albion three  days later.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> John&rsquo;s final game for Celtic came on May 1, 1971  when Jock Stein gathered the Lisbon Lions together to take a final bow  in front of 35,000 at Celtic Park. The late, great Ronnie Simpson  couldn&rsquo;t play due to his shoulder injury but he took to the pitch for  the pre-match warm-up. Bertie Auld and Stevie Chalmers also played their  final Celtic game that day as the Bhoys beat Clyde 6-1.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> At the  Celtic Player of the Year Awards in May 2004, which had been voted for  by over 50,000 Celtic fans, Martin O&rsquo;Neill presented John Clark with the  Lifetime Achievement Award for his services to Celtic.</span></font><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><br><h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></h3><br></font></div>
