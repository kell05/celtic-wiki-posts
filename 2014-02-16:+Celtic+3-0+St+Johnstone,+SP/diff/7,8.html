A poor mans Kenny Miler (sic),  yet to be seen. His workrate at least should have him in the team ahead  of Sammy, Balde and Pukki. I thought Mathews should have moved to left  back when Fisher came on. Izzy is a big miss on the left hand side, so  hopefully he&#39;s not out for too long. <br><br>Johanson looks like a great  addition, but would be even better if he put some weight on. Sorry, not  better, but more able to out muscle goons who will come after him. With  Biton, always looking to get the ball forward instead of sideways, and  it makes us a much better team to watch.  It gets the team on the front  foot more often than a Mulgrew, Brown, Kayal type midfield. <br><br>Stokes is an  enigma. Looked like he thrived on Griffiths&#39;s runs, and they looked  more like a front two than we&#39;ve had all season. <br><br>Enjoy Virgil while you  can, because he is by a long way, our most valuable playing asset. I can  see him stepping up to EPL, and getting better. Forster has got better  and better the longer he has been here. We will find it very difficult  to replace him. <br><br>Lenny gets stick for some strange team selections, and poor tactics, but he got it right today. Keep doing it that way.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Forster         </li><li>    02  Matthews         </li><li>    03  Izaguirre      (Fisher - 21&#39;

third Celtic hat-trick earned Celtic a comfortable 3-0 Scottish Premiership win over St Johnstone at Parkhead.<br><br>Scorers: Celtic - Stokes (16, 64, 66)<br><br>The Irishman had netted just twice in the 18 games before Leigh Griffiths&rsquo; &pound;1million arrival from Wolves but made it four in two games as he was partnered alongside the former Hibernian man from the start for the first time.<br><br>He opened the scoring after 16 minutes before adding a quick-fire double after the break to take his tally for the campaign to 11 and reaffirm the league leaders&rsquo; 21-point lead over nearest challengers Aberdeen.<br><br>The clean sheet saw keeper Fraser Forster equal former Aberdeen goalkeeper Bobby Clark&rsquo;s 43-year-old record of 12 games without conceding a league goal.<br><br>But the shut-out had little to do with the Englishman&rsquo;s talent and more about Saints&rsquo; lack of menace in attack.<br><br>When he did have a save to make with eight minutes left, it was a result of a deflection off team-mate Virgil van Dijk.<br><br>The moments before kick-off were marked by the re-appearance of the Green Brigade. The controversial ultras group was banned and its base in section 111 of Celtic Park was closed by Hoops chief executive Peter Lawwell at the start of December following several warnings about behaviour.<br><br>But with just five minutes to go before the match started, a 250-strong group holding a Green Brigade banner marched into section 118 of the Lisbon Lions Stand to the sound of cheers from the rest of the Parkhead support.<br><br>The group&rsquo;s repertoire was restricted to songs about the team rather than the political numbers which have landed it in trouble in the past, but it certainly helped to lift the atmosphere on a day when the Glasgow giants ran out in front of another sparse crowd.<br><br>There was a flatness to Celtic&rsquo;s play in the opening moments and they were almost undone after seven minutes as David Wotherspoon flashed a decent strike just over the bar after Emilio Izaguirre gifted him possession.<br><br>Griffiths made his first Hoops start two weeks after completing his move from Molineux but he wasted his first chance as he wandered offside before heading wide from a Kris Commons cross.<br><br>But the Scotland striker soon helped engineer the opener.<br><br>He combined with Van Dijk after the Dutchman&rsquo;s driving run and then played in Stokes, who wriggled past a couple of half-hearted challenges on the edge of the box before planting a shot beyond Alan Mannus&rsquo; reach.<br><br>Izaguirre limped off to be replaced by Darnell Fisher after 21 minutes but that did not deter Neil Lennon&rsquo;s side now they had the lead.<br><br>Commons crashed a thunderous left-foot shot off the bar from 30 yards out as the hosts cantered towards half-time without giving Saints a sniff.<br><br>Lennon&rsquo;s men had cruised through the first period but returned for the second with an increased tempo and threatened twice in the opening stages as first skipper Scott Brown shot straight at Mannus before Stokes went high and wide with a wild swipe.<br><br>Stokes then sent a free-kick over the bar while there were some moments of scrambled defending from the visitors as the Hoops stepped it up again.<br><br>But the pressure told as Brown went over the heads of the Perth defence with a scooped cross to Stokes, who took a touch before smashing the ball into the bottom corner at the back post.<br><br>The Irishman completed his hat-trick two minutes later as Stefan Johansen and Commons worked together before feeding Stokes, who drilled a low drive past Mannus at his near post.<br><br>The keeper was making his first appearance since breaking a thumb a fortnight ago but it was his reactions that looked fragile as he got down slowly to the shot.<br><br>He looked beaten again soon after as Brown hammered a low shot off the base of the post, while substitute Derk Boerrigter fire wide after Griffiths&rsquo; back heel put him through.<br><br>Forster had been a virtual spectator for 82 minutes when he had to produce an instinctive block with his foot after Nigel Hasselbaink&rsquo;s shot sprang up off Van Dijk to earn his record-equalling shut-out, while Griffiths was denied his first Hoops goal by another offside flag in the final five minutes.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>By Andy Campbell BBC Sport Scotland<br><br>A hat-trick of fine finishes from Anthony Stokes gave Scottish Premiership leaders Celtic a comfortable victory over St Johnstone.<br><br>The striker fired home from outside the penalty area to give Neil Lennon&#39;s side the lead following a pass from Leigh Griffiths.<br><br>Captain Scott Brown&#39;s inventive chip was the catalyst for Stokes&#39; second, the 25-year-old volleying into the net.<br><br>And a low drive completed an impressive day&#39;s work for Stokes and his team.<br>Play media<br><br>Kris Commons and Brown both hit the post in what was a dominant display from Lennon&#39;s men, who remain unbeaten in the league and re-establish a 21-point lead.<br><br>However, the visit of Saints came off the back of a Scottish Cup defeat by Aberdeen while the Perth side had been buoyed by their progress to that tournament&#39;s quarter-finals.<br><br>Indeed Saints enjoyed a positive opening spell and it was not until Griffiths headed wide from an offside position that Celtic began to impose themselves.<br><br>Griffiths was making his first start since joining from Wolves and played his part in the opening goal, laying on for Stokes to work the space and release a shot past Alan Mannus from 20 yards.<br>Anthony Stokes scores for Celtic against St Johnstone<br><br>Stokes took his tally of goals to 11 for the season<br><br>Commons was also in the mood for a goal and his superb 30-yard strike rattled the post.<br><br>Saints were restricted to long-range efforts as they toiled at the start of the second half with neither David Wotherspoon nor Brian Easton able to trouble Fraser Forster, who has not conceded a league goal since November.<br><br>Stokes may have been awarded a penalty following a challenge by Steven Anderson right on the edge of the box but referee Steven McLean awarded a free-kick that the striker fired off target.<br><br>However, he did not have to wait long for his second goal with Brown dinking the ball across the six-yard line for Stokes to control and blast home on the turn.<br><br>And Stokes netted again by beating Mannus at his near post from near the 18-yard line.<br>Play media<br><br>There was little respite for St Johnstone and Brown&#39;s low shot at the end of a driving run fizzed along the turf and came back off the post.<br><br>Forster then used his foot to secure a record-equalling clean sheet and spared the blushes of a team-mate in the process.<br><br>The goalkeeper, who matches former Aberdeen stopper Bobby Clark&#39;s run of 12 league shut-outs, blocked after Efe Ambrose had turned Nigel Hasselbaink&#39;s low cross towards goal.<br><br>With time running down, Griffiths found the net with a clipped shot past Mannus but the offside flag ensured a further wait for the Scotland international&#39;s first Celtic goal.  <br>   <br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 3, St Johnstone 0.<br>90:00 +2:18 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 3, St Johnstone 0.<br>90:00 +1:45<br><br>Corner, St Johnstone.
