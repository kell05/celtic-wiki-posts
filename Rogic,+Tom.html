He had pace and height, and a good brain. <br><br>Not exactly very forthright in the challenges, it has often been a complaint over his willingness to go in for a tackle, but that was not often a problem.<br><br><b>Early Days at Celtic</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Rogic, Tom - Pic" height="324" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/5ylIw-hoh4bqn25IAcDHew23584/GW324H324" title="Rogic, Tom - Pic" width="324"></h3>Opportunities were to be few and far between in the early days. The midfield at Celtic was loaded with quality players, and from his appearances there were few moments in which he was involved in that stood out. Admittedly a skilled and talented footballer, but was lacking the last pieces that made him essential to the side. <br><br>Sympathisers to the young player argued that he was not being given a run of games as he required. to develop, but he had to prove his worth like everyone else. Players like Forrest, McGregor and Watt proved their worth without any similar reputations or external support set-up, so Rogic had little to complain about here. If anything, he was given more games in the first team than if he hadn&#39;t the external support team behind him pushing for his place.<br><br>Tom Rogic ended up joining Melbourne Victory on loan in 2014 as he bid to keep his World Cup dream alive, something that he was being warned about repeatedly by some former Australian players. Celtic&#39;s concern is our first team not his Australian national side. He hadn&#39;t even made a name at club level (not having played much either at Celtic or even in Australia), so this was mistaken priorities. He needed to learn to walk before he could run. <br><br>There was too great a gulf between the belief in his ability from his compatriots and what he had done so far on the pitch.<br><br>To some people&#39;s surprise he was omitted from the Aussie world cup squad for Brazil 2014 (although not for the Celtic support). It was reported to be due to injury but he hadn&#39;t been impressing in any case (many cynics were unconvinced of the injury reason).<br><br><div>The initial predictions for his career were now seeming to be foolish and a difficult burden on him. Australian football was dipping after a golden period, and expectations were unfairly raised. Rogic seemed to represent those misplaced hopes, and the responsibilities were to be a toll on him. For observers in Australia it was a humiliating blow, and comically blame was being apportioned to spurious targets by his then diminishing band of sympathisers. <br><br>When he returned to Celtic in early 2015, he arrived back unnoticed by the support and unreported by the media. It spoke volumes. He was given a token place on the bench in May 2015 for a league match but didn&#39;t play with only kind words later from the manager about his future chances. A vote of confidence in this way can lead to the law of unintended consequences.   </div><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><b>The re-boot</b><img align="right" alt="Rogic, Tom - The Celtic Wiki" height="250" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/95ba644d0433057ae2e995ca5dd51431/GW250H250" title="Rogic, Tom - The Celtic Wiki" width="250"><br>It was back to square one at the start of the 2015-16 season, and to the surprise of many Rogic was given a chance by manager Ronnie Deila to impress again. Rogic took this with both hands and given his first start for eons, he scored a peach of a goal v Partick Thistle in a two nil win. The plaudits finally rang out for the man, and he was back in everyone&#39;s plans, with the manger&#39;s faith repaid (partially).<br><br>If one moment sealed his rebooted career it was the late winner in a 1-0 victory over Kilmarnock, where from outside the box he took a stab at the ball in open play through the defence and round the goalkeeper into the keeper&#39;s right-hand corner. It was a magnificent goal, and showed his talent.<br><br>From there, he kicked on and slowly won over the support with many fine performances finally showing the skills he had and paying off with goals and assists. <br><br>The man to thank the most was Ronny Deila who went against the grain and gave Rogic the further opportunities when all else had written him off (and were to he humbled by his recovery). <br><br>Ronny Deila&#39;s reign may have ended ignominiously but the great form of Rogic and a few other youth players was a sign of his strengths, and was an invaluable reward from his managerial spell. Rogic was in debt to him, without whom his whole career in senior football would likely have been stone cold dead otherwise.<br><br><b>Brendan Rodgers Era</b><br><div>The following season and the youth tag had to be finally discarded, and he was now a mainstay in the side as under new manager Brendan Rodgers he further excelled in the incredible treble winning side of 2016-17 which was undefeated at home. Rogic was a key man and provided number of great goals and assists. <br><br>It was a golden era, and Rogic was heralded amongst the best at the club as the club achieved under Rodgers a Treble-Treble of nine domestic trophies in a row.<br><br>A proud moment was scoring the opener for Celtic in the League Cup final in 2016-17, a goal that showed his talent, sweeping along the edge of the box before surprising all by shooting low a diagonal shot curling round the goalkeeper into the net, setting Celtic up for the 3-0 win. <br><br>As a barometer of his development, when he was out injured in the latter half of season 2016-17, many bemoaned his absence despite the first team still doing very well, with an unexpected home draw with TheRangers put down partly by some due to the first team missing Rogic. It was for him, a welcome development.<br><br>Tom Rogic: Often derided for not lasting full 90mins gametime, played most of the Scottish Cup final (May 2017) &amp; scored the vital goal at the death that sealed the treble and InVIncibles tag for an unbeaten Celtic side domestically. He was immortalised in Celtic Football history now for that goal,and worthy of it. It has been oft-repeated across all social media with many getting goosebumps in just watching &amp; reliving that moment.<br><br>He was coming onto his own and even further afield with some exceptional goals for the first team domestically with Australia, his form was being noticed across the world. <br><br>Became a thorn in side of TheRangers, with it becoming routine for him to score against them (and they were often great goals anyone would be proud of). He just knew how to curve out a goal when needed.<br><br>He repeated his great form as Celtic dominated the scene in 2017-18, repeating the domestic treble, and Rogic was again a key player throughout. The team was not as good as previously but he kept on a level.<br><br>However, Season 2018-19 was a frustrating one. Rogic was lost to international duty during mid-season and Celtic lost to TheRangers for the first time ever partly due to his absence. Then on international duty away to some unnecessary tournament he was injured, and effectively was out for the rest of the season. His return late on was one of an insipid and unfit player  </div><div><br><b>Neil Lennon Era</b></div><div>[....]</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5

We chart his remarkable rise from amateur football to Celtic via the Socceroos and what his future holds. Can he live up to the tag of the &#39;New Moravcik&#39;?<br><br>He&rsquo;s been compared to Lubomir Moravcik. Tony Vidmar has labeled him Australia&rsquo;s best young player since Harry Kewell. Some praise indeed. Welcome to the world of new Celtic midfielder Tom Rogic.<br><br>After joining Celtic in early January during their winter training camp in Spain, the Australian international went home to decide on his future. It was apparent Celtic would be offering the youngster a full time contract. Negotiations with his A-League club, Central Coast Mariners, were straightforward; there would be no standing in his way. The decision was now Rogic&rsquo;s &ndash; stay where he was comfortable, or try his hand under the pressured microscope of Parkhead?<br><br>The early signs are that he chose wisely.<br><br>The little, well big (1.88m) gem, has settled in well in Glasgow. It represents the latest step in his meteoric rise from amateur youth player to international superstar. Born in Griffith, a suburb of Australia&rsquo;s capital Canberra, Rogic was immediately immersed in sports. He was by all accounts a natural athlete. He represented his school at cricket, rugby and football, excelling in each sport.<br><br>For Rogic and his family, it became apparent that a career in football would be a challenge indeed. Not necessarily because the youngster lack the relevant talent, but because finding opportunities was tough. The football scene in Canberra is in its infancy. Canberra is a rugby city. A devout rugby city.<br><br>His first, and most important, breakthrough came in the form of Nike&rsquo;s competition &lsquo;The Chance&rsquo;. Officially dubbed as the opportunity for Nike to select the world&rsquo;s most talented, unsigned eight players, it gave Rogic a platform to build a career. He beat 100,000 applicants to the final selection and with it, trials galore. He went to trials across Australia, eventually settling on a spot at Central Coast Mariners &ndash; known for their ability to nurture raw talent.<br><br>Make no mistake, Rogic was raw. The talent was apparent but without dedicated academy coaching of the highest quality, he was relying on natural talent above all else. Fortunately for midfielder, his attitude took care of the rest. He put the hours in. He listened when he needed to and challenged every other time. Crucially, he caught up. He made up for lost time and by 19 was ready to play professional football.<br><br>Looking back, it was perhaps a gamble for the Mariners to sign Rogic. The A-League isn&rsquo;t blessed with endless resources so gambling is a risky business indeed. The short term contract the initially offered was repaid almost immediately as his elegance, intelligence and technique was instrumental in the resurgence of the Mariners. He was perhaps their player of the season, with 5 goals in 24 games.<br><br>It was only a matter of time before Europe called.<br><br>A move to Celtic is perhaps the ideal step. The club has an affinity with Australian players and the similar cultures will ensure a smooth adaptation. He&rsquo;s also joined a club where player development and improvement is considered paramount. He won&rsquo;t be allowed to rest; he&rsquo;ll be expected to improve under the demanding and watchful eye of manager Neil Lennon.<br><br>Upon signing for Celtic, YouTube videos circulated on social media forums for Celtic fans. They were clearly impressed with his technique and eye for goal. He was more like Moravcik than they could&rsquo;ve imagined. Where did this ability come from? Well, an answer may lie in another format of football.<br><br>Few realise that Rogic was an Australian international Futsal player. The game, based on small sided, indoor pitches, with an emphasis on controlling play in confined spaces and at speed, improved his all-round technique and speed of thought. It&rsquo;s a South American phenomenon and the likes of Messi, Ronaldinho and Neymar have all grown up playing the game. Slowly it&rsquo;s gathering pace as a training method globally with many professional academies including Sporting Lisbon, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool executing it on an almost daily basis.<br><br>The brilliance of Futsal comes in the form of the heavier ball. There&rsquo;s no chance to play lofted passes or take powerful shots. It&rsquo;s about finesse and precision. Watching Tom Rogic is much the same. He crafts chances. He executes finishes. He doesn&rsquo;t bully the ball, he cares for it.<br><br>For Celtic the most impressive part of the deal was the fee; &pound;400,000. In today&rsquo;s game it represents a snip for a player who has the potential to command Celtic&rsquo;s midfield for the next decade. Impressively, The Hoops beat off competition from Fulham, Reading, Celta Vigo and Club Brugge in luring him.<br><br>If the most impressive part of the deal is the fee, then surely the most important part is the position Rogic occupies. Celtic have been crying out for a creative playmaker for some time now. Rogic offers the physical presence that many of his peers have lacked as well as the necessary creativity. This balance between strength and technique should serve him well in both the rugged SPL and the more cultured European games.<br><br>Celtic fans will of course need to be patient. He has the talent, but he needs time to adjust. The difference between A-League football and the SPL is huge. Throw in European club games and it&rsquo;s exaggerated yet further. He&rsquo;s started brightly and looks composed and intelligent. His impressive attitude should also help in this regard.<br><br>Either way, the signs look positive for this talented youngster. If he turns out half as good as Moravcik was for Celtic, he&rsquo;ll be a match winner and fans favourite. Parkhead is excited.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>More steak, less sizzle needed from Tom Rogic in A-League at Melbourne Victory</h3>Read more:  http://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/more-steak-less-sizzle-needed-from-tom-rogic-in-aleague-at-melbourne-victory-20140318-hvjwo.html#ixzz2wMTC6OL0<br>It can&rsquo;t be easy being charged with the responsibility of being your nation&rsquo;s saviour, especially when you are not long out of your teens.<br>Its a burden borne for the past few years by on-loan Melbourne Victory midfielder Tom Rogic, and it seems to be weighing rather more than he can bear.<br>The hype around Rogic for the past couple of years has been enormous.<br>But on the evidence of his form since his arrival back in the A-League in January, the hype has been misplaced.<br><br>On what we have seen so far in his half a dozen games in navy blue, Rogic is a long way from being the player everyone in the country wants him to be; the player many believed, before his return, that he had already become.<br>It&#39;s not his fault such expectations were shovelled on his slender back.<br>After all, with the fading of the golden generation, the Socceroos lack superstars.<br>Australia have only Mile Jedinak playing in the English Premier League, no one in Serie A or La Liga, and only bench warmer Mitch Langerak and the injured Robbie Kruse in the Bundesliga.<br>So it&#39;s hardly surprising the football community has been searching, desperately, for someone to hang its hat on.<br>With his silky skills, his languid movement and his size and scope, Rogic, who moved to Scottish giants Celtic just over a year ago, seemed the obvious candidate.<br>He had, at times, dazzled in his 24 appearances for Central Coast, and also impressed in cameo displays as a substitute for the Socceroos.<br>But the reality is that the progress everyone expected and desired does not seem to have been made.<br>A player of Rogic&rsquo;s quality should, after nearly two months in the A-League, be making a bigger impression than he has.<br>The 21-year-old has yet to dominate proceedings in the manner his admirers would have hoped, and he struggles to finish games. He has not scored a goal, nor contributed many assists.<br>There is no doubt he has a terrific touch, but there has been little end product.<br>When he gets on the ball, he often takes too many touches. When he loses possession, he does not always track back to help the defence &ndash; a trait, it must be acknowledged, many of Victory&rsquo;s other forward players have shared this season.<br>He has also been rather injury prone and struggles for fitness, all factors which have impeded his progress and will be of concern to national team coach Ange Postecoglou.<br>Postecoglou is a great admirer of Rogic&rsquo;s ability and it is widely expected he will be in the World Cup squad, having played a role in helping Australia qualify.<br>But on his current A-League form, it is hard to see Rogic having done enough to earn a starting spot in the Australian team.<br>In fact, there are some Victory fans not only wondering what all the fuss is about, but whether or not the club should have signed him in the first place on a loan deal.<br>Not because he doesn&rsquo;t have talent, but because the logic of the deal was more about Rogic than Victory.<br>There was little likelihood he would stay beyond the period of his loan, so there would be no long-term benefit for Victory, and his presence there was chiefly for Rogic to play regular first-team football and gain fitness before the World Cup.<br>It would seem that Victory &ndash; or any A-League club he had signed for in the January window for that matter &ndash; would have been of secondary consideration to Rogic warming up for the World Cup.<br>You can&rsquo;t blame the player for taking the opportunity, and if it works out for Victory and the Socceroos in the end, then all will be smiling.<br>To be fair to Rogic, he doesn&rsquo;t write the headlines nor has he touted himself as the answer to all of Australia&rsquo;s problems.<br>Fans here need to get a grip and not confuse potential with achievement.<br>When he left the Mariners last January, it didn&rsquo;t stop Graham Arnold&rsquo;s team from getting on with the job: three months later they had won their first A-League championship without him in the team.<br>And far from decrying Celtic and the Scottish Premier League, perhaps there should be a pause for reflection. Rogic has been in Glasgow for a year and had not established himself as a first-team player. When Mark Viduka went to the Glasgow giants, he overcame a shaky start to quickly become a top player in the league and a prolific goalscorer.<br>Scott McDonald, a forward who often attracts more criticism than is warranted in this country, went to Celtic and was a regular first-team player and regular scorer, netting against the likes of Manchester United in Champions League ties.<br>Given the nature of deadlines, this column, at least for the print editions of Fairfax publications, had to be written before Tuesday night&rsquo;s Asian Champions League clash with Yokohama F Marinos, so it&#39;s quite possible Rogic will hit form in the tie and show us what he is capable of.<br>For Victory&rsquo;s sake, it is to be hoped that is the case. Postecoglou and every Australian with an eye on Brazil in three months will be hoping the talented young man can begin to fulfil the promise he has shown on a more regular basis.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><br></div></div>
