Smart, swathe and composed, he is perfect for this modern media age, and he uses it well.<br><br>A long relationship with the club since the old days of the early nineties, he more than knows the whole club, and as a genuine supporter understands the nuances of the support. If anything, having seen the club at its worst under the Old Biscuit Tin board he has learnt the costs of mismanagement. <br><br>Those who doubt his ability need only look across the city to her fate of the now defunct Rangers/Deidco and their long line of money men. Across Scottish football there are plenty of other incompetents. Lawell therefore stands out. <br><br>Some great standouts:<br><ul><li>Tackling the Huns, in a staged joint media conference with Rangers counterpart Martin Bains, he made some humorous jibes which easily put them in their place and helped to clear the name of our club following a tumultuous match v Rangers recently.</li><li>Out manoeuvring the SFA who tried to get Newco/The Rangers back into the top tier league, saying no they should start at bottom.</li><li>Good/Prudent financial management of the club.</li><li>Standing by Neil Lennon when practically all wanted him out after the embarrassing 3-0 defeat to Kilmarnock. Took guts to do this than take the easy option, and it paid off. </li><li>The rebuilding of the forefront of the Celtic Park area. </li><li>Humiliating Rangers announcement on ludicrous moonbeam transfer amounts for Jelavic. </li><li>The generally good press and media management, something that was a bane on the past. </li><li>The improved management of issues with the SFA &amp; other authorities. Remember he has had to handle situations which the Green Brigade have put the club into difficult situations with their banners. Not easy.</li></ul><br>He has often played a blinder when tackling his foes, and even when the press try to devalue him, he seems to always bounce back. NewCo fans like to try to make out that he controls the SFA, you don&#39;t need to be a genius to figure out that is nonsense.<br><br>His main critics generally cover the generally left wing politicos (like the Green Brigade), the perennially frustrated supporters and other keyboard militants. <br><br>You have to add that Lawell has had to balance up the different authorities and supporters factions. It&#39;s possibly fair to say that no other Celtic head has ever done it so much better. When you look back over the thirty years prior to his appointment, the club&#39;s management had been marked by continual rifts with authorities with Fergus McCann or the old Biscuit Tin board. Granted a lot of that was due to the Hun&#39;s hegemony of the system, but Lawell steered the control away from them. That was healthy for the game.<br><br>In fairness, one issue that has irked many supporters he been his pay. He has been paid handsome amounts with his bonuses, sometimes excessively and this is something that has irked fans especially as numbers attending the matches was falling as his pay rose . Yet he was being paid th going rate in th market whether people liked it or not. He had been targeted by clubs down south but opted to remain, that in itself shows his commitment to the club were he could have made a mint away from Celtic. <br><br>The club had stuttered during his reign but nothing is easy in the lopsided football environment in European football. Stuck in a rut we are not going anywhere but men like Lawell try their best. Issues like the appointment of Mowbray are criticised but few disagreed with it at the time, but should have been cut faster. Transfer budgets are no easy issue either, and simply we can&#39;t compete anymore. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes</h3>&ldquo;Everything we do, we look for value.

The first time was when he decided to apply for the position of executive director, head of operations, at Celtic Park in 2003; the second was when he was courted by Arsenal in 2008 only to inform them that he was not interested in becoming their chief executive. Otherwise, during his time at the club, Lawwell has suppressed his instincts as a supporter.<br><br>That, at least, is the way that Celtic fans view it. They believe that he has refused to spend the money required to win the title back from Rangers, prioritising the club&rsquo;s financial position at the expense of the team&rsquo;s success. While some Celtic supporters will grumble about Neil Lennon&rsquo;s selection decisions, a larger number consider the chief executive to blame for Rangers winning three championships in a row.<br><br>Immediately after the 2-0 defeat by Hearts at Tynecastle, Lawwell had to mingle with supporters and journalists outside the ground after the fire alarm went off. He worked his way through the small crowd with a confident poise, attentively dispensing greetings and encountering no derision. Yet it exists within the Parkhead support, having grown from the moment in January 2009 when Hibernian reacted to Celtic&rsquo;s interest in Steven Fletcher by holding out for &pound;3m.<br><br>At the time, Gordon Strachan&rsquo;s side were four points ahead of Rangers in the league, but ended the season as runners-up. The narrative that grew out of that turnaround was that if Lawwell had sanctioned the &pound;3m bid for Fletcher -- who ultimately moved to Burnley for that amount, then on to Wolves for &pound;6.5m -- then Celtic would have won their fourth title in a row, instead of allowing the balance of power to switch to Ibrox.<br><br>The logic is too simplistic, of course. What if Fletcher had been injured, or taken some time to adjust to the demands of playing for the Old Firm (as many other players have done when arriving from another Scottish club)? Football fans need a scapegoat, and the depiction of Lawwell as an accountant more interested in prudence than glory has become ingrained as Rangers have wracked up trophies while suffering the heavy debt that was a consequence of Sir David Murray&rsquo;s extravagant spending and the threat of a significant tax bill from HRMC.<br><br>Even now, as Celtic sit 10 points behind their rivals, albeit with a game in hand, the grim wit of Glasgow depicts a scenario where the Ibrox side are able to win the league despite suffering a points deduction for suffering administration. There is an over-reaction among Celtic fans to Rangers being ahead, since the season is only 10 games old; Lennon&rsquo;s side have looked a little jaded and disjointed, but the momentum they gathered from winning 2-0 at Ibrox last January carried them to the cusp of the title, until they suffered a loss of nerve in Inverness.<br><br>A similar run could still be possible, but the fear of Celtic supporters is that they slip further behind Rangers. They wonder why a goalkeeper hasn&rsquo;t been signed on a permanent contract, why another dominant centre-back was not recruited to partner Kelvin Wilson and why a new striker wasn&rsquo;t bought to play alongside Gary Hooper. The reason always comes back to Lawwell, but then it also misses the point of his role. There is a reason why he has survived longer than any of his four predecessors -- Terry Cassidy, Jock Brown, Allan MacDonald and Ian McLeod -- and it is because, despite the fortunes of the team fluctuating, off the field Celtic have grown in strength and stability.<br><br>The club&rsquo;s debt was once as high as &pound;29.62m in 2001, but the last published figures in August 2011 showed that figure had fallen from &pound;5.85m to &pound;530,000, with revenue down by &pound;9m to &pound;52.6m, but a profit raised of &pound;100,000. That kind of shrewdness is an empty solace to supporters, but it is the reality of Celtic&rsquo;s existence in the Clydesdale Bank Premier League, where revenues are limited. Rangers face the same issues with income, but are also careworn by first their debt and now their tax case.<br><br>Lawwell has become a defining influence at the club, his authority only superseded by Dermot Desmond, the majority shareholder. Within the game, Lawwell is admired for his hard-headed negotiating skills, his refusal to be swayed by populist decision-making, the way he reduced the club&rsquo;s wage bill and the establishment of a worldwide scouting network, while Celtic have become more bullish under his stewardship. All of which explains why he has been linked with the chief executive position at Manchester City.<br><br>An accountant, who began his working life as a trainee at Babcock Energy in 1970, Lawwell is considered a careful pair of hands. He has a low public profile, preferring to talk to journalists in private rather than in set-piece interviews, although often only when it is self-serving, while those who have worked with him talk of a fierce determination but also a deep-seated pragmatism; he retains his enthusiasm for the club while not being swayed by any emotional attachment.<br><br>There have been mistakes of judgments over transfers, but also successes, not least the sale of Aiden McGeady for &pound;9.5m and the reinvestment strategy that brought admired players like Emilio Izaguirre, Biram Kayal and Hooper. Yet the mocking jibe that Lawwell aimed at Rangers once the transfer window had closed was crass at the time and looks even more ill-advised now.<br><br>Lawwell believes he is applying logic in an environment that is too often irrational, but he cannot lose sight of the fact it is the fortunes of the team that cast perspective on every decision. He is, for all his detachment, a hostage to Celtic&rsquo;s results, like everybody else at the club.  <br><h3>             	    		        </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Lawwell to help Celtic get down to business</h3>The Scotsman<br><br>Published on Friday 26 September 2003 01:00<br><br>HAVING previously worked for one of the world&rsquo;s leading pharmaceutical companies, Peter Lawwell will hope he can be the cure to what has been a persistent headache for Celtic.<br><br>The 44-year-old Glasgow businessman was yesterday announced as the replacement for Ian McLeod, who vacated the position of chief executive at the Parkhead club in April this year.<br><br>Significantly, however, Lawwell will not inherit the title of chief executive which has appeared akin to a curse at times to predecessors such as McLeod, Allan MacDonald and Terry Cassidy.<br><br>Lawwell, in fact, was employed by Celtic as financial controller from 1990 to 1991 during the tenure of the colourful and controversial Cassidy. A lifelong supporter of the club, he returns to a very different set-up in the role of Executive Director, Head of Operations.<br><br>It is an unwieldy title but his job description remains the same as that applied to a chief executive. Celtic, however, are keen to let it be seen that no-one at the club holds a more prominent or significant role than manager Martin O&rsquo;Neill.<br><br>&quot;Basically, this is recognition that football comes first and that everything else is there to support the football side of the business,&quot; said a club spokesman.<br><br>Lawwell, who has been commercial director of the Clydeport property company for the past three years, was previously chief executive of Scottish Coal and has also held senior management positions with ICI and Hoffman-La-Roche, the US pharmaceutical giant. <br><br>Married with three children, Lawwell is regarded as a pragmatic, driven and successful businessman. Those who know him well describe an engaging, charismatic figure who is expected to come across well as a public face of Celtic.<br><br>Those Celtic supporters who believe their passion for the club should be shared by those in such positions will be gratified to learn that Lawwell can rhyme off the names of the Lisbon Lions from one to 11, in alphabetical order or by dates of birth.<br><br>&quot;This is a job I have coveted for many years and I can&rsquo;t wait to get started,&quot; said Lawwell. &quot;Celtic is a unique organisation, from its unrivalled fan base and its sporting traditions, to its footballing and commercial potential.<br><br>&quot;From my previous time at Celtic, I have a true appreciation of the demands which will be placed upon me in my new role and I&rsquo;m relishing the opportunity.<br><br>&quot;The success of Celtic plc depends, to an enormous degree, upon the team&rsquo;s success on the pitch, and one of my key roles will be to work closely with Martin O&rsquo;Neill and ensure that he has every possible support to help deliver the winning performances that everyone wants to see, from the fans and the players to the staff and the investors.&quot;<br><br>Brian Quinn, the Celtic chairman who has in effect been carrying out the chief executive duties since McLeod&rsquo;s departure, is naturally convinced his board have landed the right man for the job.<br><br>&quot;We made it clear when we started this process that we would take our time to ensure we got the right person,&quot; said Quinn. &quot;As you would expect, the standard of applicant for this crucial position was excellent and those we interviewed were of the highest calibre, therefore we are delighted to have secured someone of Peter&rsquo;s proven ability.<br><br>&quot;His business pedigree, coupled with his vision for the club and obvious passion for Celtic made him the outstanding candidate.<br><br>&quot;His role reflects the fact that football companies are different from most in that almost everything depends upon footballing success.<br><br>&quot;Therefore, Peter will be responsible for overseeing all operations of a non-footballing nature to ensure that the highest levels of infrastructure and support are available to the manager.&quot;<br><br>O&rsquo;Neill, with whom it is vital Lawwell develops a fruitful working relationship, also issued a welcome to the new man.<br><br>&quot;The success of Celtic is very much a team effort on the part of everyone associated with the club,&quot; said O&rsquo;Neill. &quot;Peter&rsquo;s commitment to Celtic is clear and I am sure that he will make an extremely valuable contribution to helping the club achieve its goals.&quot;<br><br>Lawwell will take up his new post once he has agreed a notice period with his current employers, probably at the end of October or start of November.<br><br>Meanwhile, on the pitch, Alan Thompson has attempted to dampen down the growing clamour for his promotion to the England squad by insisting his only concern is Celtic.<br><br>Thompson has been in outstanding form this season, causing O&rsquo;Neill to speculation that he may be the answer to England&rsquo;s &lsquo;problem&rsquo; position on the left side of midfield. The player insists, however, that a call-up from Sven Goran Eriksson is not something he will lose sleep over.<br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s not something that I think about,&quot; Thompson said yesterday. &quot;I think that he [Eriksson] has been up to see Celtic play, so it&rsquo;s just one of those things.<br><br>&quot;The England team is full of good players and good players can play anywhere. They have people who can perform on that side so all I am concerned about is getting on with what I am doing at Celtic. That&rsquo;s what is important.&quot;<br><h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Lawwell reported over Blues quip</h3><br>CELTIC chief executive Peter Lawwell was the target of an angry Rangers backlash last night after poking fun at the club during the Hoops&#39; AGM.<br>Evening Times Nov 2013<br>The Bhoys supremo ruffled the feathers of his city rivals when he was asked about the Ibrox side being the same institution it was prior to liquidation, with Lawwell replying: &quot;Rory Bremner can pretend to be Tony Blair.&quot;<br><br>The chief executive, who is also on the SFA board, later claimed he was trying to &quot;inject a bit of humour&quot; into proceedings at Parkhead.<br><br>However, The Ibrox club last night reacted sharply to his remark, stating they plan to take action and notify the &quot;relevant football authorities&quot;.<br><br>A statement read: &quot;The club are disappointed with the comments attributed to Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell earlier today.<br><br>&quot;Rangers Football Club, now in its 141st year, has a proud history which has been recognised by the football authorities and was noted in a recent SPL Commission determination.<br><br>&quot;The Club will now take this matter up with the relevant football authorities.&quot;<br><br>Celtic chairman Ian Bankier had enjoyed a similar joke when he had introduced the board at the beginning of the meeting.<br><br>Stopping at Ian Livingston, who became a lifelong peer of the House of Lords this year, Bankier stated: &quot;Ian has been elevated to the House of Lords and has taken the title of Lord Livingston of Parkhead.<br><br>&quot;I thought he would go with Lord Livingston of Ibrox - so he could lord it over Rangers.&quot;<br><br>Bankier got another laugh when he said that the asset value of the club is in Celtic&#39;s hands.<br><br>He went on to say he wasn&#39;t going to show title deeds, a throwaway line that raised a chuckle.<br><br>Meanwhile, Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster finally earned his first England cap last night after he started for the Three Lions against Chile at Wembley.<br><br>The Hoops No.1 has been in terrific form both domestically and in the Champions Leauge of late, with the form of regular England No.1 Joe Hart called into question in recent weeks.<br><br>The Manchester City shot stopper has been dropped for his club due to his form, and national boss Roy Hodgson saw last night&#39;s challenge match to give Forster his first taste of national service.  <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Lesson in canny football team management</h3>  February 24, 2013 11:39 pm  Ft.com  By Mure Dickie  <br>Peter Lawwell of Celtic marshalled his resources to keep club afloat, says Mure Dickie    Glasgow, one of the world&rsquo;s most football-mad cities and a hotbed of near-tribal team rivalries, might not seem an obvious place for a lesson in the principles of sensible soccer business management.    Indeed, the biggest sports story of recent years in Scotland&rsquo;s second city has been the disaster at once-mighty local club Rangers, which was forced into liquidation by hefty debts and controversial tax liabilities and now labours in the lowly third division.      <br><br>But while Rangers offers a stark example of the dangers faced by even the world&rsquo;s most famous football clubs in an era of soaring player wages, just across town can be found a much more positive footballing case study in the form of Celtic FC.    Amid a flood of financial disaster across the Scottish game and beyond, Celtic finds itself virtually high and dry, debt free &ndash; even as it relishes the achievement of making it to the last-16 stage of Europe&rsquo;s Champions League competition.    <br><br>So what is the secret of the fine flush of health being enjoyed by a club that celebrated its 125th birthday in November?    In part, says Peter Lawwell, chief executive, it is about simply keeping a level head when all about you other football executives are losing theirs.    &ldquo;I think in football, in particular, it&rsquo;s so easy to be seduced by the highs and too depressed by the lows,&rdquo; Mr Lawwell says in an interview in the stadium some fans call Paradise. &ldquo;[Success comes from] keeping on a business footing.&rdquo;    <br><br>For Celtic, a key turning point came more than half a decade ago, when the club realised it could not compete on a financial basis at the top European level.    Ticket sales to a large and loyal local support were increasingly outweighed by the importance of television rights revenues. And an ever more overheated international market in football talent sent salaries for the best players skyward.    <br><br>For Celtic, stuck in the Scottish league without the global audience commanded by southern neighbour England, playing the new business game could have been disastrous.    TV rights to the Scottish Premier League generate less than 1 per cent of the income attracted by its English counterpart, says Mr Lawwell, leaving Celtic no choice but to find new ways to success.    One response was to forgo buying successful players with high transfer price tags and hefty salaries.    <br><br>So, when Celtic saw it could not match the wage bill of its European competitors, it actually took &ldquo;several million&rdquo; pounds from its budget for the club&rsquo;s first team and put it into training, recruitment and sports science.    It was, as Mr Lawwell says, &ldquo;quite a brave thing to do&rdquo;. <br><br>Yet while some fans grumbled, the focus on &shy;finding and developing new talent has given Celtic a pool of young players that are an investment as well as a cost.    By casting its recruitment net widely, the club has also been able to build a presence in overseas &shy;markets where Scottish football would otherwise make little mark.<br><br>In a high-profile example of the strategy, Celtic bought South Korean midfielder Ki Sung-yueng from FC Seoul in 2010. Ki was not only &ldquo;man of the match&rdquo; in Celtic&rsquo;s 2011 Scottish Cup final victory, he made South Korea the second biggest market after Scotland for sales of its Nike replica kits.    And the sale of Ki to Swansea last August for a reported &pound;6m also accounted for the bulk of the &pound;5.2m profit from transfer market trading that the club reported in its interim results this month.    <br><br>Repeating such tricks will be harder as other teams join the trend toward more sophisticated analysis of sporting talent.    <br><br>And Celtic will also pay a price for Rangers&rsquo; woes: the rivalry between the &ldquo;Old Firm&rdquo; as the two Glasgow teams are known has long been a driver of ticket sales and interest.    Still, the lack of Old Firm games this season has been more than offset by European success, even though a 3-0 home defeat at the hands of Italy&rsquo;s Juventus this month looks set to end Celtic&rsquo;s Champions League run.    <br><br>And Mr Lawwell insists that the club will remain firmly focused on long-term benefit rather than short-term gains, no matter how heated sentiment gets in the stadium.    &ldquo;Everything we do, we look for value,&rdquo; he says. <br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve just got to be strong to your principles and do the right thing.&rdquo;    Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2013.

In terms of the banners I don&rsquo;t take that personally.<br> <br> &ldquo;I take it as a sign of the times, but the answer is this: If I&rsquo;m not here, then there will be a new me.<br> <br> &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s not suddenly going to find tens of millions of pounds stuffed in the bottom drawer. And he&rsquo;s only going to try and do the same things that I&rsquo;ve been doing to maximise the future of this club.<br> <br> &ldquo;Listen, I can understand why people on the outside looking in have their opinions but they don&rsquo;t actually know how the club is run.<br> <br> &ldquo;We see it at the Emirates, we see it at Goodison and Villa. That&rsquo;s where we are in today&rsquo;s society. When supporters become frustrated and disappointed they look for people to blame.<br> <br> &ldquo;At first it was Ronny who got it and he&rsquo;s now going so the sights are trained on me but my view is that, as a club, we&rsquo;re in very good shape.<br> <br> &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a very, very tough year but we look forward with a new manager and a new beginning.<br> <br> &ldquo;At the moment I&rsquo;m focused on getting the right manager in and preparing for the new season.<br> <br> &ldquo;Criticism is par for the course when you&rsquo;ve been at the club as long as I have. There are going to be lows and you&rsquo;re going to get it in the neck. It&rsquo;s the same for Dermot who&rsquo;s been here even longer.<br> <br> &ldquo;I can understand why it happens because the supporters always look for more. But my life is based on reality, not perception. I know exactly where we are as a club. We&rsquo;re in a good place.<br> <br> Banner<br> Frustrated Celtic fans make their feelings clear towards the board<br> <br> &ldquo;If I decide to go or the board decides it&rsquo;s time for me to go, then the club is merely going to get a new me. Now the new me might be better but he might not be as good. But the club will continue down the same track.&rdquo;<br> <br> Lawwell could have upped and left long ago. He could have easily accepted one of the enticing offers from England of much more money for far less grief.<br> <br> And frankly when Celtic supporters think of that prospect there will be many of them who wish to hell he had. But he didn&rsquo;t, for one reason.<br> <br> Lawwell added: &ldquo;I love the club. If it was about the money I wouldn&rsquo;t be here. I&rsquo;ve had opportunities to go &mdash; for a LOT of money &mdash; but I chose to stay.<br> <br> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just been one opportunity either. But Celtic is my life. It&rsquo;s more than a job, it&rsquo;s a passion.<br> <br> &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve supported Celtic all my life. I&rsquo;d like to think when I do eventually go I can look back and say: &lsquo;I did this, that and the next thing&rsquo;.<br> <br> &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got social media and the bloggers, posters and trolls who think they know what&rsquo;s going on at the club. They don&rsquo;t.<br> <br> &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have all the information. The reality is different from their perception and I need to deal with reality every day.<br> <br> &ldquo;But criticism comes with living a public life in 2016. People dislike me having never met me, but that goes with the territory and you either put up with it or you don&rsquo;t.<br> <br> &ldquo;And at the moment I&rsquo;m putting up with it because I&rsquo;ve got things to do. But I&rsquo;ll be honest, the job is all-consuming, it&rsquo;s 24/7.<br> <br> &ldquo;There is very little time in my life when I don&rsquo;t think about Celtic and my job.&rdquo;<br> <br> Lawwell&rsquo;s priority right now is to identify and appoint a manager to take Celtic into the Champions League. To do what Ronny Deila couldn&rsquo;t.<br> <br> But whether it&rsquo;s Moyes, Rodgers, Lennon, Keane or AN Other what&rsquo;s certain is that there isn&rsquo;t going to be a huge pot of money to spend.<br> <br> Lawwell added: &ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to go to the new manager and say we have a &pound;40million warchest or a &pound;50m warchest to buy the best and go for it.<br> <br> &ldquo;But we play in Scotland, we don&rsquo;t have that. The reality is we don&rsquo;t have an alternative to what we&rsquo;re doing. For me that&rsquo;s an exciting project for the right manager, the right guy. This is Celtic.<br> <br> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an iconic club, one of the biggest in the world. Even today we&rsquo;re highly regarded as one of the best-run clubs in Europe.<br> <br> &ldquo;There is an excitement here which should be an attraction for somebody to come, get a hold of it and take us back into the Champions League.<br> <br> &ldquo;If your ambitions are to win the Scottish Premier League and move on then I can see that. But our ambition is to go further so for me it&rsquo;s a very attractive proposition for somebody who wants to come in and create something.<br> <br> &ldquo;We get criticised for our strategy but I just don&rsquo;t see any alternative. Everything we take out we put back in.
