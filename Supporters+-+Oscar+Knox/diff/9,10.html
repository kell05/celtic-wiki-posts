We cherish our loved ones and would have it no other way. However, for the Oscar Knox family tragedy was to strike when they discovered that their young child, Oscar, was diagnosed with cancer. <br><br>Through the trials and tribulations, this working class family from Ulster worked hard to raise awareness of his condition and across all communities he was helped with donations and showered with love. <br><br>His family were Celtic fans, and the club and its supporters paid respect and support to the young bhoy. He was the guest of honour &amp; team mascot at the Celtic v Cliftonville matches in the European Cup, and it melted your hearts to see him so happily playful on the pitch. <br><br>He touched everyone&#39;s hearts, and despite having once fought off the Cancer, it returned and he sadly passed away in May 2014.<br><br>It is better to remember this young bhoy for the strength in him for fighting his illness, and he was brave. His beautiful wee happy similing face and his strength in adversity is something we should all admire, and we are all very humbled by him.<br><br>Proud to be able to number him as a Celtic Bhoy, and to his family &amp; all their friends, our sincere condolences. You&#39;ll never walk alone.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/2013-07-17%3A+Cliftonville+0-3+Celtic%2C+European+Cup" target="_self">2013-07-17: Cliftonville 0-3 Celtic, European Cup</a></li><li><a href="/page/2013-07-23%3A+Celtic+2-0+Cliftonvillie%2C+European+Cup" target="_self">2013-07-23: Celtic 2-0 Cliftonvillie, European Cup</a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Celtic family mourns brave Bhoy Oscar Knox<img align="right" alt="2013-07-23: Celtic 2-0 Cliftonvillie, European Cup - Pic" height="308" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/usigaHP_BcZC4TSqP8bCRw329746/GW567H308" title="2013-07-23: Celtic 2-0 Cliftonvillie, European Cup - Pic" width="567"></h3><br>By: Newsroom Staff on 09 May, 2014 09:23<br>http://www.celticfc.net/news/5849<br><br>OSCAR Knox, the brave little Bhoy from Belfast whose courageous fight against cancer touched the hearts of the Celtic Family, has passed away at the age of five.<br><br>At this desperately sad time, the thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with his parents, Stephen and Leona, his little sister, Izzie, and all of his family and friends.<br><br>The devastating news was announced by the family this morning.
