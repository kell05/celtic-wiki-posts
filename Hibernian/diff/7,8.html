Albion Road is 4th on your right. From virtually anywhere else, you&#39;re probably gonna have to brave the A90 &amp; A902 which goes through the north of Edinburgh. Take a right at Great Junction Street, follow it through Duke Street and Lochend Road, then another right into Hawkhill Avenue at Lochend Park and then follow the road into Albion Place. But I would advise parking elsewhere before you get there as that&#39;s pretty much the home end!<br><br><b>BY BUS:</b> Lines 1, 4, 15, 26, 44, 66, 106, 113, 124, 129 and X5 all take you from Princes Street to the stadium. Coach parking is at the Scottish Parliament, which is about a ten minute walk from the stadium <i>(source: Fudgie Bhoy)</i>.<br><br><b>BY TRAIN:</b> Best you&#39;ll probably manage is to get the train to Waverley Station in the centre of town and either walk down Leith Walk or Regent Road onto Easter Road or get one of the aforementioned buses.<br><br><b>PARKING:</b> Park about two or three streets off from Easter Road. One that lies between the A902 and Easter Road itself would probably be best. Use Multimap to work it out. Your other bet would be to park down at the park at the bottom of Easter Road. Its quite easy to get parked round, but does have the downfall of having to walk through the home fans at the end of the game.<br> <b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>WHAT TO EXPECT</h3><br>Three big stand and a wee one. Kinda like a small version of Celtic Park in that aspect. You&#39;ll find all the neds and such like tend to congregate in the smaller one cos its pretty much a converted terracing. And its still used as such really.<br><br>Don&#39;t get a front row seat in the upper section, the barriers block your view, and you don&#39;t get a restricted view discount. Other than that, leg room isn&#39;t bad and the facilities are pretty good all in all.<br><br>Whinge whinge whinge... the home fans have the biggest chip on their shoulder in the SPL. They still complain that we stole half their team... in 1888. You&#39;ll hear them go on about how they were first to wear the green too. While (almost) strictly true, no one actually cares.<br><br>Salt and sauce on your chips. Don&#39;t worry about it too much, the sauce is watered down with vinegar anyway.<br><br>Word of warning - Leith is on the other side of Edinburgh from practically everywhere. And Edinburgh is a traffic nightmare at the best of times with one way systems and such. So try not to get lost on the way out. Especially if you have a long drive ahead of you once you leave Edinburgh... <i>(source: Richie)</i><br> <b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>SAD TRIVIA</h3><br>Hibernia is the Latin name for Ireland.<br><br>There&#39;s a pub on Easter Road imaginitively named &quot;Doon the Slope&quot;. This is in reference to the infamous Easter Road slope. Apparently the difference in height from one end of the pitch to the other was actually six feet! The slope was finally levelled out in time for then 2000/01 season. Teams who would win the toss as Easter Road often elected to kick up the slope in the first half, so they would have it easier in the second!<br><br>The West stand (opposite the small one) was completed for the start of the 2001/02 season. For the 2000/01 season, Hibs had played in front of a reduced capacity crowd for much of that season to replace the old stand. The stands at both ends are pretty much identical, and are also fairly new, having been completed in the mid-1990s.<br><br>You&#39;ll find that the North Stand is also known as &quot;The Famous Five Stand&quot;. Nothing to do with the books, this refers to former Hibernian players Gordon Smith, Bobby Johnstone, Eddie Turnbull, Lawrie Reilly, and Willie Ormond. These five were instrumental in Hibernian&#39;s most successful period throughout the late-1940s to early 50s where they won the league three times out of six. As such, they got to take part in the first European Champion Clubs&#39; Cup tournament (the first British team to do so), where they got all the way to the semi finals. There they lost out 3-0 on aggregate to Reims, who themselves lost to the might of Real Madrid in the final.<br><br>The Hibernian badge currently shows symbols of everything that is important to them. A football at the top, a harp to the left to show their Irish roots, a sail ship representing the Port of Leith where Hibernian play, and a castle at the bottom as a symbol of Edinburgh. This badge first appeared in 2000, replacing one described by some as a &quot;planet saturn&quot; design. This new badge was felt to better reflect the traditions of the team.<br><br>It is believed by some (mainly Hibs fans funnily enough, although &quot;The Celtic Story&quot; also briefly touches on it) that Hibernian&#39;s 1887 Scottish Cup win was one of the big reasons that Brother <span class="diffRemove">walfrid</span><span class="diffAdd">Walfrid</span> and co started a football team in the east end of Glasgow. Seeing the success that they had and the influence it could have for the Catholic people of Glasgow, Brother Walfrid attended a challenge match Hibernian played in Glasgow.<br><br>It should be noted that this version of Hibernian is not strictly the original. The one that won the Scottish Cup in 1887 actually folded in 1891 (reasons cited appear to blame Celtic&#39;s resources and popularity, unsurprisingly), and reformed a few months later having dropped their &quot;practising catholics only&quot; signing <span class="diffRemove">policy.</span><span class="diffAdd">policy [although some reports and sources from then seem to deny this was the</span> <span class="diffAdd">case]. </span>The Hibernian badge today still claims they were founded in 1875 though. So strictly speaking, this current Hibernian are actually THIRD to wear the green...<br> <b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>TIM FRIENDLY PUBS</h3><br><i>&quot;The royal nip on the corner of albion st/easter rd we usually go here for a few jars before the match,never any hassle.&quot;</i><br>- Hooped Avenger<br><br><i>&quot;Middletons on Easter Road, probably one of the finest Alehouses in Edinburgh.&quot;</i><br>- Big_Bobo_Balde, Fudgie Bhoy<br><br>Any more???<br><br><b>PUBS TO AVOID</b><br>Anyone???<br><div></div><div><b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></b><h3>Early Newspaper Article</h3><i><span class="diffAdd">(background to following: An aggrieved Hib&#39;s treasury wrote the below &quot;Open Letter&quot;. He was the same one who later ran off to the US with the club&#39;s money. So any supposed moral high ground from this letter shows his stance is tainted.

There is Wisdom in a multitude of counsellors. Probably this may be a sufficient reason for my action, but if any be needed, it is that being practically an outsider I may look upon the present position from a different point of view than your committee, who, being always in consultation together, are apt to adopt a uniform set of opinions which may or may not be the best, but which will not be harmed if they are the best by anything which I may say, and it is entirely with hope and desire of stimulating the proper feeling which I think should be shared by all of you at the present time, and of laying an outside view before your committee, in the hope that they may find a suggestion worth their consideration that I write this letter. I do not hesitate to express my opinions publicly, for I am firmly of the opinion that the, more you throw yourself on the sympathy and support of the people, both of your persuasion and otherwise, the more it will be for your benefit, and ultimate recovery from the severe and reprehensible blow which has been dealt you.<br><br>Probably, now, you know the worst, which, let me say, is not so bad as it might have been; you will be at least free from the trying anxiety which you must have expressed for some time past, and for which, if it was as severe as in my case, you were not to be envied. The uncertainty which existed among you as to the real extent of the defection of your late players, led your committee and many prominent members to journey to Glasgow on Saturday to witness the scene at Celtic Park. You were no doubt struck, as I was, when you entered the grounds, at the manner in which the formation of the new club has been taken in hand, and at the evidences of wealth with which the appearance of everything impressed a beholder. It certainly made a brave show: the spacious grounds, commodious stand, and the white flag with green crossbar flying triumphantly above. A brave show certainly you thought, as in imagination you returned to the old field in Edinburgh, with its bare and careworn appearance, where so many great battles have been fought by the club which has made a name for Irish football, and for which every true Irishman still retains his affection. You felt a pang of sorrow as you compared the old with, the new; but a rush to your heart of warm affection for the old club buried any regret that had arisen, and it was with indignation and a determination to give your services more than ever to the old cause, that you took up your positions in the ground.<br><br>You no doubt wondered, as I did, at the proud manner in which your old players came out to fight against the victory of the club around which so many glorious associations cling&mdash;the Hibernians. Could they really think that they had the same right as you to uphold the honour of Irish football? Patriotic Irishmen, truly, the Celtic and its supporters ; patriotic Irishmen, indeed, who, in order to raise the name of Celts&mdash;a name which may cover Welsh, Highland Scotch, French, and all the nations of that family&mdash;dealt, as they thought, and by means which are apparent to everybody, a death blow to the Hibernian club. Fortunately, it is by no means a death blow, and, after Saturday&#39;s display, you can afford to laugh at them; the great Celtic shown up in such a manner by the combination which you managed to gather and place in the field at the last moment, in order to uphold the good, old name. If McGhee had not been injured badly and compelled to leave the field, or if the referee&#39;s decisions had been true, the Celtic would have been mourning a defeat at this moment. How your old players, McKeown, Groves, and the rest, did jump and somersault about the field when the Celtic saved themselves by scoring twice towards the close of the game! How great was their pleasure when they managed to beat the Hibernians! If your feeling, were like mine, how you must have loved them at that moment !<br><br>A friend beside me on the ground said that, &quot;if the Hibernians only placed their boots on the field these could beat all the Celts who ever wore a white shirt; at least,&quot; said he, &quot; if McGhee had done that the ten men and McGhee&#39;s boots would have won.&quot; I said I held an opinion of that sort, but it was not their boots I would have taken, it was their shirts. &quot;Put eleven green shirts on the field,&quot; I said, &quot;and the Celts will never put the ball past them&rdquo;. This was perhaps overdrawn a little, but the feeling which I had was that the Hibernians did not pretend to be anything else than true Irishmen; who are not ashamed, but proud, to wear the green, and who don&#39;t wear a white shirt and edge the collar with green so that it requires a microscope to detect the colour at all.<br><br>After all, what have you lost? Look the question all round, and consider you have had a jolly good riddance of men who, though they may be, or may have been, good players, were not worthy of the club, or they would not have left it in the manner they did. Six of last year&#39;s team have deserted, besides old and prospective members. The first are McKeown, McLaren, Gallocher, Coleman, Dunbar, and Groves; and the others include Kelly, McCallum, Goverin, the two McLaughlins, and others. Well, they have gone, so let them go. You will not go out of your way to harm them; but if the Celtic club gets into a scrape if they ever should manage to beat another club in the cup ties, you would be angels, not men, if you were to do anything to help them.<br><br>You will be grateful, as I am, to those players who at the critical moment in the club&#39;s history have come forward to help you to recover your footing. Several of those players at least would not, had your club been surfeited with players, looked near you; but they could not stand by and see their old club, to which their hearts warm, go down without an effort to save it. All honour to Jimmy McGhee for remaining staunch to the green, and may he yet carry the cup to Edinburgh, as he did two seasons ago! And the same to George Smith and Billy Naughton, and to the ever-faithful, warm-hearted and hot-tempered Felix Docherty ! and to Phil Clark, and may he always make such a show of Gallocher when he plays against him as he did on Saturday! And to McGovern, McKenna, McVey, Clifford, White, and clever little Mulvey ! You will prove before this season is done, boys, that it does not require McLaren and his fellow-clubmen for the Hibernians to raise their fame.<br><br>Now then, lads, go into the season with the proper spirit. Evil deeds never prosper; the duplicity of the founders of the Celtic club will defeat its purpose. You will play with an easy conscience, and with a determination to do honour to the old name &mdash;the Hibernians.<br><br>Gentlemen of the committee, have a good heart, and look after your present team well. They will merit your confidence. Members of the club, give your every support to the committee. Irishmen in Glasgow and throughout Scotland, show what you think of the effort to ruin the Hibernians, whose headquarters are EASTER ROAD.</div></div><br></div>
