He had  first came to prominence as Scotland&#39;s centre back in the 5-4 schoolboy  international victory against England at Wembley in May 1980 when Paul  McStay inspired the Scots to victory.   <br><br>A hard-tackling, no  nonsense defender Coyle made his first team debut as a sub in a 1-0  league defeat at home to Dundee on May 4th 1985. He had already  established an excellent central defensive partnership with Paul McGugan  in a successful mid 1980&#39;s Celtic reserve side.<br><br>The centre-half  made only one further appearance. He was thrown into the senior team  after Paul McGugan broke his foot against Rangers leaving an already  sieve-like defense even more open. <br><br>He played in the next game, a 4-2  defeat to Dundee Utd at Tannadice on 4th January 1986 on a day where  Celtic found themselves 4-1 down at half time. Unfortunately he was up  against perhaps the best forward line in Scottish football at that time -  Bannon, Gallacher, Kirkwood, Sturrock and Dodds. It also has to be said  that he was given little assistance from the experienced Roy Aitken who  was well out of form.<br><br>He never really got the chance to prove  his worth at Celtic and never really recovered from being thrown into a  team in a desperate state. The following season he continued with the  Reserves before going on loan to Middlesbrough in December 1986. He was  eventually sold to Middlesborough for &pound;5,000 in March 1987.<br><br>He returned to  Scotland to join up with Frank Connor at Raith Rovers in January 1988  and continued to play with Raith right up to 1995 when they won  promotion to the Premier Division. He was in the Raith team that  defeated Celtic to win the League Cup in 1994/95 and took part in their  European campaign the following season. He left Raith at the end of that  season and had spells with Ayr Utd, Albion Rovers and East Fife before  retiring from the game in 1999.<br><br>He was later believed to be working  in marketing, and was part of a number of former Raith Rovers  players who lent weight to the &#39;<i>Reclaim the Rovers</i>&#39; campaign, taking  part in a fundraising walk in the summer of 2005. <br><br>In April 2009  Coyle was diagnosed with a form of leukaemia which saw him admitted  to the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre. The club and his friends  stood by him, and a benefit game in 2011 was organised by Raith Rovers  against a Celtic side (old players) which included Paul McStay who flew  over specially from Australia for the match.<br><br>Sadly, Ronnie Coyle died soon after on 12 April 2011. He was only 46. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">SCOTTISH CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">EUROPE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">TOTAL</font></b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1979-87</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td></tr>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <font color="#333333">Goals</font></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3>none   <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Coyle%2C+Ronnie+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Raith Rovers organise re-run of 1994 League Cup Final against Celtic for former defender Ronnie Coyle   	</h3> 	 	Feb 24 2011<br><br>Daily Record<br><br>  	 	 	 	Raith Rovers and Celtic will stage a re-run of their 1994 League  Cup  Final in a benefit match for Ronnie Coyle on Sunday, March 27.

Although he never claimed to be the most talented, he  will be  remembered as a committed contributor to a club he said  bestowed him  with his favourite football memories.<br><br>It is just  over two weeks  after almost 3,000 people turned up at a benefit match  in honour of a  player who was unflinching and even hot-tempered in his  younger days,  but who will be remembered for his warmth and good humour  and an  unwavering will to win.<br><br>Unfortunately, after two years  of  fighting his acute illness, he lost the final battle and passed away   quietly at the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, leaving behind   his wife Joan and three children.<br><br>A popular figure among fans  and  former team-mates, he was immediately forgiven for his slip which   allowed Jurgen Klinsmann to equalise on that memorable night in Germany.   Forgiven by everyone other than himself, though, according to former   colleague Colin Cameron.<br><br>&quot;He always used to get cut up about   that. The boys never for one minute held it against him, but he was an   honest pro and he still took it on his shoulders.<br><br>&quot;When we all   came back into dressing room at the end of that match we could see it   was playing on his mind so we all made a point of going over to him and   telling him we didn&#39;t blame him in any way, and it says a lot about him   that he was quite humbled by that.<br><br>&quot;He did beat himself up about it. He was the type of guy that would take everything on his shoulders; he was a lovely guy.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m   just glad we all got together with him at the benefit match and had a   chance to have a laugh and talk about old times.  Those are more   memories we will treasure.&quot;<br><br>Describing him as a father figure,   Cameron says one mark of the man was his willingness to guide the   younger players in the squad: &quot;He had a firm hand, but, at the same   time, he would be there to put an arm around your shoulder if things   weren&#39;t quite going for you.<br><br>&quot;Coyley was the butt of a lot of the   jokes for us younger guys - guys like myself, Stevie Crawford, Jason   Dair - but he took it all in good spirit because he knew that we looked   up to him.&quot;<br><br>And while he was a centre-half who took no nonsense,   he was also more skilled than many gave him credit for, according to   Craig Brewster.</div><br>&quot;He was talented, but he wanted to beat two or  three people in his own  box! He was one of the traditional, playing  centre-halves. But one day I  wound him up so much in training that he  just volleyed me off the ball,  booting me up the arse, warning me not  to do that again. So he was  tough as well.&quot;<br><br>Charged with halting  the opposition he was never  slow to retell tales of his own scoring  exploits, though. &quot;He always  claimed he scored one of the greatest  goals in Scottish football  history,&quot; laughs Brewster, reliving fond  memories of his friend.<br><br>&quot;When  we played St Mirren in the first  game of the season after they had just  been relegated (in 1992], we  beat them 7-0, but he scored the third  goal and it was the only one  that mattered! It was a peach, and he did  dribble the length of the  pitch before slotting it home. He said it was  Baresi like. He thought  he was Baresi! He wasn&#39;t, but he was a wonderful  man.&quot;<br><br>Until you  crossed him. A winner to his core, Gordon  Dalziel remembers his  travelling companion&#39;s reaction when he beat him  in a golf competition.  &quot;The best thing about that time wasn&#39;t the  memories on the pitch, it  was the banter and the bond we had as a  squad,&quot; said Dalziel.<br><br>&quot;I  travelled to training and games with  Ronnie and one day we were all  travelling back after I had won at golf  and I was really rubbing it in  because I knew he hated to lose. I was  going on about the Pringle I had  won as a prize as we were driving over  the Forth Road Bridge and he  asked to see it. He said he was thinking  about buying one for himself,  but when I gave him it, he quickly opened  the window and threw it out  and I never saw it again!&quot;<br><br>A winner  but also a team player and a  loyal friend. When Jimmy Nicholl guided  Raith into the 1994 Coca-Cola  Cup final, Coyle was ruled out with an  Achilles injury, but despite his  non-participation and the fact that it  was his close friend Paul  McStay whose spot kick was saved in the  penalty shoot-out to give  Rovers victory, he still listed that day one  of his favourite football  memories. It summed up the man and the bond he  enjoyed with his  team-mates.<br><br>Which is why they all turned out on 27 March in his honour. <br><br>The   fundraiser was a recreation of that cup final with all the original   combatants in attendance, including McStay who flew over from his home   in Australia to take part and with one or two special guests, including   Gary Pallister and Denis Irwin.<br><br>Signed by Frank Connor, his  former mentor at Celtic in January 1988, he  was at the club for eight  years, leaving to sign for Dalziel at Ayr  United. But he was always  fondly remembered in Kirkcaldy, and, while  they will mourn his passing,  colleagues and fans remain grateful that  they had their chance to  relive memories and express that affection  before it was too late.  &quot;That day meant so much to him,&quot; said Brewster.  &quot;And to us all. He was  still up at 4am, he didn&#39;t want to miss thing. I  don&#39;t think any of us  wanted it to end.&quot;<br><br>The funeral will take  place at 10am on  Tuesday ,19 April at St Peter&#39;s RC Church, 154 Braehead  Road, Paisley,  followed by a service at Woodside Crematorium at noon.<br> <h2>  </h2> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>Ronnie Coyle - Obituary </h3> The Herald<br> <div class="comments-top"><a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/comment/obituaries/ronnie-coyle-1.1096203#have-your-say" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Coyle, Ronnie - The Celtic Wiki" class="icon-comments" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Coyle, Ronnie - The Celtic Wiki"></a></div>          		Published on 14 Apr 2011 	       	          	          	    	      	               <div class="article-body comment-article-body">               Footballer;       	                                              Born August 4, 1964; Died April 12, 2011. <br>  <br>    RONNIE  Coyle, who has died aged 46 of  leukaemia, was a footballer who began  his career at Celtic but who made  a name for himself with Raith Rovers  and played a significant part in  the 1994 League Cup run that ended with  the Kirkcaldy team beating the  Glasgow outfit in a memorable final. <br>   As  a schoolboy at St Gerard&rsquo;s Secondary,  in Glasgow, he lived for football  and dreamed of the day he would don  the famous Celtic hoops. <br>  <br>  He was  good enough to win Scotland Under-15  schoolboy honours in 1980 and was,  along with Paul McStay, with whom  he struck up a life-long friendship  during these school days, John  Robertson, John Sludden and Ally Dick,  one of  the stars of the  Scotland team which beat England 5-4 in a  memorable televised schools  match that year. <br>   He  was also playing alongside McStay for  Celtic Boys Club, so it was no  surprise when he moved on to the Celtic  staff. But his hopes of matching  the prodigy McStay&rsquo;s deeds for the  club were to be unfulfilled. <br>   He  made a couple of first team  appearances, making his debut in a 0-1 loss  to Dundee at Celtic Park on  May 4, 1985, before making his second and  last appearance in a 2-4  loss to Dundee United at Tannadice on January  4, 1986. But, after a  loan spell with Clyde, he was released and went to  England, to join  Middlesbrough, before moving on to Rochdale. <br>   He  returned to Scotland in the summer of  1988. Frank Connor, his mentor at  Celtic Park, was now manager at Raith  and he brought Coyle home. He had  found his place and over the next  eight years he donned Rovers&rsquo; blue  shirt more than 250 times, forming  an excellent central defensive  partnership at Stark&rsquo;s Park with Shaun  Dennis. <br>   Coyle  made his Raith debut on the opening  day of the 1988-89 season, in a 1-3  defeat at St Johnstone. He scored  the first of his nine goals for the  club in a 3-0 win over Clydebank  towards the end of that season as  things began to look up for the club. <br>   Twice  he helped the Fifers win the First  Division title, but, although he  played his part in the team getting  there, he missed the high spot of  his years in Kirkcaldy, the 1994  League Cup Final win over his boyhood  heroes Celtic. <br>   An Achilles tendon injury  consigned him to  the Ibrox stand for that game, which must have been a  difficult one  for him to watch &ndash; the drama of the 120 minutes of play,  then the added  tension of the penalty shoot-out, during which his great  friend  McStay, now Celtic&rsquo;s captain, saw his penalty saved by Scott  Thomson,  before Rovers triumphed to kick-off a memorable celebration  back in the  Kingdom. <br>   That victory earned  Raith a crack at  Europe and the Uefa Cup. Coyle was not going to miss  out this time.  They were beaten 2&ndash;0 by German side Bayern Munich in the  first leg,  which was played at Hibs&rsquo; Easter Road ground. In the second  leg they  led 1&ndash;0 at half time against all odds, before eventually losing  2&ndash;1. <br>   From Raith Rovers he moved to Ayr  United,  signing for the Honest Men in March 1996 before making his debut  in a  2-2 draw with Stirling Albion the next day. The following season  was in  his only full season at Somerset Park and during it he was a key   player as the Honest Men won the Second Division title, playing in 30 of   their 36 league fixtures. <br>   From Ayr he  moved on to finish his career  in the bottom flight of senior Scottish  football, firstly with Albion  Rovers, then East Fife and finally Queen&rsquo;s  Park. <br>   In retirement Raith&rsquo;s place in  his heart  was such that, when the club faced closure in 2005, he flung  his weight  behind the Reclaim the Rovers campaign and took part in the   fund-raising effort with a marathon walk which helped keep the club   alive. <br>   But in 2009 he collapsed at home  and was  diagnosed with leukaemia. He battled the disease with all the  passion  he had shown on the park. In March 2010 he received an emotional   returning hero&rsquo;s welcome when he was able to take in a Raith game at   Stark&rsquo;s Park, but he and his family accepted his case was hopeless. His   death came just over two weeks after an emotional benefit game for him,   at Stark&rsquo;s Park, brought together most of the players from that 1994   League Cup Final. <br>   Paul McStay even made  the long trip from  Australia to pay tribute to his old friend, while  other former team  mates travelled from all parts of the UK to honour  their friend. <br>  <br>   Ronnie Coyle was a good  if not great  player. He fulfilled a childhood ambition when he played in  the Celtic  first team; he played in three famous matches &ndash; that 5-4  Wembley  victory and the two Uefa Cup clashes with Bayern and represented   Scotland at youth level. <br>    But what really won him admiration from the football public was his courageous but ultimately unsuccessful, battle leukaemia. <br>  <br>   Ronnie Coyle is survived by his wife Joan and their three children, Kevin, Briony and Georgia.                    </div><br></div></div>
