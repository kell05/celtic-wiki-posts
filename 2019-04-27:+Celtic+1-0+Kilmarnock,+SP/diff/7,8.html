Billy &#39;Cesar&#39; McNeill was so much to the Celtic support: a local hero, captain of the European Cup winning side, the inspirational hero and so much more. His passing was not unexpected, but it still dug deep. For all those from Lanarkshire (from where he hailed) it was a very big blow to all.<br><br>The tributes to him flowed from across the globe, and all media. It was very humbling.</div><div></div><div>At Celtic there was pre-match tributes at his statue in front of the stadium, banners inside, black armbands, constant chants &amp; songs in his name and also 67 seconds applause in his honour. Must add that the Killie fans were wonderful and joined in, and there was a banner from them in his honour too. <br><br>So much good to say in tribute to him, and the amazing part: the winner was scored by a central defender wearing no.5 on the 67th minute with a header (Billy McNeill&#39;s number was 5 and was a central defender and was famous for his headed goals). Incredible, as if written in the stars.</div><div></div><div>Celtic is a fairtyable and a miracle, and Billy McNeill embodied that.</div><br><br>(TMH of KDS)<br>Yesterday&#39;s performance and result pretty much summed up this season for  me - we&#39;ve mostly got the results we needed, but often thanks to mental  strength and physical fitness, rather than quality (off the pitch as  much as on it). And when we&#39;ve come up against well coached sides with  much less quality, we&#39;ve often toiled.<br> <br> In future years, the record books will show we won our 8th league title  in a row with something to spare - but our squad, management and board  have struggled to convince for much of the season.<br> We started with a pretty grim transfer window, reflected in shambolic  defensive performances, especially in the CL qualifying rounds.<br> We went into the winter break neck &amp; neck at the top of the league after our worst team performance at Ibrox in decades.<br> We came back from the winter break with a couple of exciting attacking  loan signings and a new 1st choice goalkeeper - and went on a run that  opened a double-digit gap on the rest of the league.<br> We lost our manager as a league-winning run of comparatively easy  post-break fixtures came to an end, and despite the turmoil his  departure caused, still have a double-digit lead at the top of the table  with 3 games to go - even if our performances since then have often  been depressing.<br> With the league all but won, we lost our greatest ever captain, a man who personified our club.<br> <br> Right now, our defence is much more convincing than it was at the start  of the season, but our midfield and attack much less so - and most of  the team have looked like they&#39;re running on fumes for weeks.

Pic: SNS/Bill Murray<br>Andrew Smith<br>Published: 14:26 Saturday 27 April 2019<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic-1-0-kilmarnock-celtic-s-no-5-edges-league-leaders-closer-to-the-title-1-4916259<br>Billy McNeill often remarked that there is a fairytale quality to Celtic. On the day that club celebrated the life of their Prince Charming, the late McNeill&rsquo;s sentiment was exemplified in the decisive moment that delivered the happy ever after from an encounter that, at times, threatened to be a grim tale for the champions-elect.<br><br>It really did feel like there was some supreme, fated quality to Celtic&rsquo;s No.5 Jozo Simunovic producing a McNeill-style jump at the back post to glance in a Callum McGregor cross with 67 minutes showing on the stadium clock. The whole swirl of emotion across the afternoon had centred around the career touchstones of McNeill as Celtic&rsquo;s captain and galvaniser extraordinaire, who wore the No.5 on his shorts and in 1967 in Lisbon became the first player to hold aloft the European Cup with a British club.<br><br>The Celtic players all sported the No.5 on the black armbands they adorned on the day; the centre circle was enveloped by a giant, green-and-white hooped circular covering that had the figure &ldquo;5&rdquo; overlaid on it, and the Green Brigade produced a display that had as its focus the famous image of McNeill lifting the big cup under the legend &lsquo;Hail Cesar&rsquo;, in recognition both of the club&rsquo;s anthem and the nickname of their iconic former captain and manager.<br><br>Simunovic pointed to the skies as he wheeled away in celebration of a goal that means only an extraordinary turnaround could deprive Celtic of an eighth straight title. A 50th championship in all, McNeill has played his part in more of those than any other individual in the club&rsquo;s history; with nine as a player and four as manager.<br><br>For current interim Neil Lennon, with his passing this week, McNeill might have had higher power to affect the club moving to the brink of another &ndash; Rangers requiring to win at home to Aberdeen tomorrow to retain any hope of nicking the title on goal difference across the three remaining league fixtures<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amazing when you think about it,&rdquo; he said, having started the day laying a wreath at the statue of McNeill situated at the entrance to the Celtic way leading up to the stadium. &ldquo;That was a perfect way to win the game, I suppose, under the circumstances with everything that&rsquo;s happened this week and today. The big man might have been looking down on us when we needed a goal.&rdquo;<br><br>A Celtic Park, fittingly, full and full of voice as it only tends to be on European nights, sang paeans to McNeill throughout. And, yet, for all this, Kilmarnock produced a cohesiveness and a menace that largely deserted a clumsy and stodgy Celtic. Lennon conceded they are &ldquo;grinding&rdquo; their way to the title, but joked he was not to &ldquo;blame&rdquo;. They are a team that appears to have hit the wall, physically, and but for the defensive barrier offered by keeper Scott Bain, who produced three top drawer saves - twice denying Chris Burke and thwarting a venomous effort from Alan Power - Steve Clarke&rsquo;s men could easily have claimed all three points.<br><br>Following his rubbling of the reputation of referee Steven McLean last week that has landed him an SFA charge, the Ayrshire manager picked his words a little more carefully when picking apart the unhelpful display of official Willie Collum, who appeared to deny his men a penalty when Scott Brown nudged Stephen O&rsquo;Donnell in the box only 14 minutes in. &ldquo;Soft but a penalty,&rdquo; Clarke said of the incident. &ldquo;As he goes to play the ball, he gets pushed in the back so it&rsquo;s a penalty. I think I shouldn&rsquo;t speak anything else about referees.&rdquo;<br><br>His team &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; deserved more from an afternoon when the fates appeared to conspire against them. &ldquo;The players were terrific, great effort, good application, we just missed that little bit of quality on the finishes. We had the best chance of the first half, good opportunities.&rdquo; What weighted against them was an overwhelming sense of history wrapped up with the loss of a titan of the Scottish game and that simply appeared as if it had to be served.<br><br><br><br>Celtic goalscorer Jozo Simunovic: I believe I&rsquo;m blessed<br>Celtic&#39;s Jozo Simunovic hands his shirt over to Liz McNeill, wife of Billy, at the end of the match.

What followed on a day of celebration for the life of McNeill was no mere coincidence, Simunovic claimed.<br><br>&ldquo;I was surprised on the bus before the game when I saw so many fans. I couldn&rsquo;t have imagined something like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That gave me an impulse to give even more in this game. I believed it would be a special day for me because of the number five. For everyone, it meant a lot but for me it was special.<br><br>&ldquo;The manager spoke to us about Billy before the game to help inspire us. Everyone knows how big a name he is at this club and the impact he had on Celtic. He was a leader, an amazing guy. Before the game we had a meeting where the manager said a few things about him. That motivated us even more.<br><br>&ldquo;Some people will say that I&rsquo;m lucky to score with the number five on 67 minutes. But I say I&rsquo;m blessed. I believe in that.&rdquo;<br><br>That the clock was showing 67 minutes when he netted his header was something that Simunovic, who pointed to the skies, was not immediately aware of. &ldquo;First, when I scored, I didn&rsquo;t even watch on screen,&rdquo; explained the defender. &ldquo;I had something on my mind and  I&rsquo;m going to keep that for myself, what I said. But, when they start with the ball from half pitch, I turned around and thought &lsquo;you know, maybe it&rsquo;s that minute&rsquo;. And it actually was it. It made me even happier.&rdquo;<br><br>Even after the game, there was a moment to treasure when Simunovic gave his No.5 shirt to the McNeill family.<br><br>&ldquo;Trophies are also special, but for me this is something else,&rdquo; the player said. &ldquo;In having a chat with Billy&rsquo;s family after [and giving the shirt] that gave me even more reasons to remember all of this.&rdquo;  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  BBC<br><br><br>By Tom English<br><br>BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br><br> From the section Scottish Premiership <br><br>The goal by No.5 Jozo Simunovic came after 67 minutes had elapsed<br>The goal by number five Jozo Simunovic came after 67 minutes had elapsed<br><br>A goal from their number five with 67 minutes played on the day they marked the death of Billy McNeill moved Celtic to within a point of the Scottish Premiership title.<br><br>Jozo Simunovic headed in wearing the jersey graced by the Lisbon Lion and former manager, who died on Monday.<br><br>Celtic started briskly, having taken part in wreath laying before kick-off.<br><br>But goalkeeper Scott Bain had to deny Kilmarnock on several occasions before Celtic eked out a narrow victory.<br><br>Rangers must now beat Aberdeen at Ibrox on Sunday to delay their city rivals earning an eighth successive championship.<br><br>Celtic are now unbeaten in 15 Premiership games but were made to work hard for their win against a makeshift Kilmarnock side shorn of three first-team regulars through suspension.<br><br> Celtic pay tribute to McNeill<br> Lennon hopes for Aberdeen favour<br> How did you rate the players?<br><br>Display fails to match classy tributes<br><br>All week, the Celtic fans had mourned and celebrated their ultimate hero and that huge appreciation of the life and times of the great man swept across the stadium like a giant wave.<br><br>A huge number five bedecked the centre circle and the players&#39; black armbands, members of the 1967 European Cup-winning team were brought on to the pitch, there were songs and flags and 67 seconds of applause. It was a classy farewell, the kind of send-off that demanded a dominant display in its wake. And that&#39;s where Celtic&#39;s problems began.<br>Those inside Celtic Park paid tribute to Billy McNeill before the match<br>Those inside Celtic Park paid tribute to Billy McNeill before the match<br><br>Through suspension and injury, Kilmarnock were missing three defenders, not that you would have noticed. Gary Dicker and Alex Bruce were deposited in the heart of the defence and were excellent. Stephen O&#39;Donnell was high-energy alongside them. In front, Alan Power was alert and influential and, further on, the visitors had pace and wit through Chris Burke, Liam Millar and Eamonn Brophy.<br><br>Celtic had little zip about them in the opening half. Their tempo was slow, their urgency and accuracy nowhere near what the crowd was looking for on this day of all days. You expected the emotion of the day to produce a powerhouse performance, but they haven&#39;t been delivering that kind of excellence for quite a while now.<br><br>They dug it out in the end after an improved second half. The winner came after 67 minutes - spooky enough - and 16 seconds through a header from a centre-half wearing the number five that McNeill once wore. Spookier still.<br><br>The points were precious, but this was another below-par Celtic day in a growing list of below-par Celtic days. Little of what happened here will have added ballast to Neil Lennon&#39;s prospects of being the permanent manager in the summer.<br><br>Bottom line, it was a win, but the visitors made it nervous to the last kick. Kilmarnock should have been ahead at the break. Three minutes after a penalty shout when O&#39;Donnell was challenged by Scott Brown, Burke got a lucky break of the ball in the Celtic penalty area and a bit more decisiveness in his finish was required. One-on-one with Bain, his attempt was too tame. It was a golden chance.<br><br>Three minutes later, Kilmarnock cut through again, Millar breaking away from James Forrest and Mikael Lustig down the left only to shoot straight at Bain from the angle. Directly after, Conor McAleny fired on goal, Bain tipping it over for a corner.<br><br>A fourth attacking moment came within minutes, Kristoffer Ajer losing control of the ball in front of his own box and getting ransacked by Brophy. It was only the defender&#39;s pace to put a tackle in on the striker that dug him out of a hole.<br>Jozo Simunovic&#39;s header was his first goal of the season<br>Jozo Simunovic&#39;s header was his first goal of the season<br>Invaluable goal in different ways<br><br>None of this was doing Lennon&#39;s chances of getting the Celtic job on a permanent basis any good. The beginning of the new half saw Kilmarnock continue their threat, Brophy and Burke testing Bain.<br><br>Celtic had to get their act together sooner or later and the first suggestion that they were about to climb from their torpor was an Odsonne Edouard effort that curled just wide of Daniel Bachmann&#39;s goal.<br><br>Bachmann was pressed into action again within seconds, denying Callum McGregor and Edouard in a mad flurry. Kilmarnock were defending much deeper now. Celtic were beginning to carry that menace you thought would be there from the get-go.<br><br>A brilliant piece of defending kept Edouard out just after the hour, but the defensive stand was about to crack. Simunovic soared above Aaron Tshibola and nutted home at the back post to bring joy, but mostly relief, to Celtic Park.<br><br>The goal was invaluable not just because of the importance of the three points in the context of wrapping up the league title sooner rather than later, but because of their desperation to do justice to this emotional occasion with a victory rather than a deflating draw, or worse.<br><br>Celtic did enough, just. They were nervous and inaccurate for much of it against a sprightly team that will feel unfortunate not to get something from their day.<br><br>The big number five in the middle of the Celtic defence made sure they got nothing.
