At this time he was playing as a striker, and his goals alerted <a href="/page/Hibernian" target="_self">Hibernian</a>, who signed him on a short-term contract. Further impressive performances led to Celtic stepping in to sign Agathe for just &pound;50,000 in 2000. Good timing too as it was the start of the great turnaround in Scottish football with Martin O&#39;Neill having come in charge of Celtic. Funnily, in a movie shot in Scotland called &quot;A Shot at Glory&quot; (straight to video rubbish) Agathe appeared in the film as a Rangers player. <br><br>His debut was in the 2-0 victory over St Mirren in the the treble winning season, and nobody could ever have believed the journey we would go through in the following years, and Agathe was there practically the whole way with Martin O&#39;Neill.<br><br>Didier can best be described as fine but flawed. Little more can be described as frustrating than watching Didier on the ball. He was able to make a dazzling run along the wing, aided by his great acceleration on the ball, only to then see him make an absolutely appalling cross of the ball to the strikers (if ever it even reached them). In some ways you couldn&#39;t really have one without the other. What made him valuable was his great pace as took the ball along the wing but at pace the end product is easier said than done. <br><br>Even with any of his deficiencies it was the pace and reaction speed that got him out of trouble (hampered also by being very one-footed). Maybe some better coaching could have paid out dividends to find a balance but nevertheless his input was worth more than the cost. When it worked it was brilliant.<br><br>In many ways, it was his transformation from a winger in the midfield to playing/starting as a full-back for his runs that paid out greater dividends. It allowed his tackling abilities to come to the fore, but also he was a good tackler and harried opposition players using his pace &amp; acceleration to keep on top of them. He thrived in the early seasons when O&#39;Neill was playing a 3-5-2 formation, but this was partially curtailed as we suffered in Europe from the three at the back. However, Agathe could be frustrating as hell as well too, and when off form it could rile up huge numbers of the support. <br><br>Right back was his forte, and when played here there was little anywhere who was as good. He was deployed mostly you could say in modern coaching parlance as a &#39;wingback&#39; and in some ways, the first true &#39;wingback&#39; Celtic have had (not that attacking full-backs was something necessarily unknown at Celtic beforehand).<br><br>Domestically there was nobody to match him in his position and he made a good difference to the first team when he was on from, but in Europe was where some of his best games came. In the &#39;<i>Road to Seville</i>&#39; (UEFA Cup 2003 final) it has been a little overshadowed just how useful and important he was in some games, with a great role in the Blackburn away match as well as Stuttgart &amp; Celta Vigo away. His pace and bombing runs up the wing put pressure on the opposition and helped create the chances that pushed us through each round.<br><br>It was no one-off either, and in Celtic&rsquo;s UEFA Cup (2004) games v <a href="/page/Barcelona" target="_self">Barcelona</a>, he tamed the very gifted Ronaldinho (then the world&#39;s top player), where the latter even applauded Agathe on the pitch for his ability. A strong runner, and intelligent player, I&rsquo;m sure that many around him would say that the Barcelona games were his finest moments, although being part of the Seville Team was another one of the great highlights of his career. <br><br>In saying all that, he has the unwanted accolade to have been likely the first Celtic player to create mass opprobrium on the Celtic football forums. The mass Celtic forums had only really kicked off early in the 2000&#39;s, and little more could kickstart a feud than a discussion on Didier Agathe. Those sympathetic and otherwise could argue all day throwing statistics and match examples of his worth or not, questioning his runs and supply etc, with an end result of a lot of long threads with not an inch budged. Still, it was better than some of the off-field arguments that were being debated on the forums at the time.<br><br>Didier scarcely featured in the 2005-06 season under new manager <a href="/page/Strachan%2C+Gordon" target="_self">Gordon Strachan</a>. He was naturally very fit and was not the best of trainers - and this did not go down well with Strachan who was a strict disciplinarian when it came to training. Strachan was known to have double training sessions which did not go down well with some of the more experienced Pros with Celtic at the time in particular Agathe and Chris Sutton, indeed Sutton had more than one bust up with the Management team claiming that he &quot;knew his own body&quot;. Agathe was linked with a number of clubs over past seasons, including Valencia CF, Juventus, Middlesbrough, and Leeds United. However, no transfer was concluded by the end of the January transfer window, and an agreement was reached to terminate his contract with Celtic on February 1, 2006. Sadly the end of his time was marked by some public spats, so it was only a matter of time before he was gone. <br><br>Must add that as with all players with pace, time catches up them and they do lose that advantage sharply at one point or another. No different for Agathe. He&#39;d had knees injuries over the years which is not uncommon for wingers, but a dreadful challenge by Webster (Hearts) on Agathe in match in 2007 really was the killer. Put Agathe out for months and he never truly recovered his best after that. <br><br>He had further trials in 2006 with Roma, Middlesbrough, Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers and Torino, but failed to secure a deal. He eventually re-signed for <a href="/page/O%27Neill%2C+Martin" target="_self">Martin O&#39;Neill</a> at Aston Villa on a short term deal which saw him make 5 appearances before being released in January 2007. <br><br>He had an unsuccessful trial with Nottingham Forest in July 2007. He was later back in La Reunion playing with local club Jeuness Sportif Saint Pierroise.<br><br>He was a great player for the club, and taking in the minimal outlay on him he was one of the best value purchases made during Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s reign. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes</h3>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain the feeling I had, playing  for  Celtic.<div></div><div>&ldquo;I  was like a child, I felt like I was dreaming, especially when we played  in the Champions League. <br>&quot;I always knew how lucky I was to be there.

The winger frequently visits St  Peter&#39;s Cemetery, just a few hundred yards from Celtic&#39;s Glasgow  training ground.<br><br>He discovered it had a statue of Our Lady of Fatima, erected at a woman&#39;s grave, in a state of disrepair.<br><br>So Agathe has been using his visits after training to help fix the statue. <br><br>On  the anniversary of the death of the woman, the 27-year-old footballer,  who is a devout Catholic, bought flowers from a local florist.<br><br>The  widower of the dead woman has met with the star and now the two of them  are making sure the statue looks like a fitting tribute. Agathe even  asked the pensioner, of Dennistoun, Glasgow, for his permission to keep  up his visits.<br><br>The star, who played a vital part in both Celtic  goals last Thursday to earn them a place in the UEFA Cup quarter-  finals, is known to take his religious beliefs very seriously.<br><br>He  was born on the Indian Ocean island of Reunion, where 86 per cent of  the population are Catholic. Agathe prefers not to spend his wages on  high living and has helped youth projects in Reunion through his career  in football.<br><br>He spends every Sunday and most days after training  visiting the statue in the east end of Glasgow. The family who own the  plot declined to comment on Agathe&#39;s good deed.<br><br>A spokesman for Celtic said: &quot;Didier considers his religion and football to be two totally different things.<br><br>&quot;This is a very private matter for him.<br><br>&quot;He only went to the statue a few times to clean it up but doesn&#39;t want a big fuss made of it.&quot;<br><br>The  story of Our Lady of Fatima relates to claims made in 1917 by a group  of three children that Mary appeared before them with a message for all  mankind.<br><br>The children were playing near Fatima, Portugal, when  they claim they were visited six times in total by the mother of Christ,  who warned the world to repent for its sin and asked all Catholics to  pray for Russia. Agathe shares his devotion to Our Lady of Fatima with  Pope John Paul II.<br><br>The Pope believes that Our Lady of Fatima  saved his life after the 1981 assassination bid by Turk Mehmet Ali Acga  in Rome. On his last vist to Portugal, the pontiff placed the bullet  which was removed from his wound in the shrine at Fatima.<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Agathe, Didier - Pic" height="422" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/-KdWTynxReuoSg8wgspDbQ69694/GW591H422" title="Agathe, Didier - Pic" width="591"><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Article 2005</h3><div><br><div>http://www.agatheacademy.com/</div><div>http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-legend-didier-agathe-story-6425992</div><br>HE delivery is quiet, without a  boast or a trace of bombast. It&rsquo;s only every so often, as he stops to  take stock, that you see the flicker of realisation on Didier Agathe&rsquo;s  face. He has been sitting on one of the greatest football stories never  told.</div><div></div><div>The  former Celtic winger&rsquo;s rise in Scottish football is well known. No  player has ever gone from Raith Rovers to Hibs to Celtic Park in the  space of a calendar year, becoming a key part of one of the club&rsquo;s  greatest ever sides.</div><div></div><div>He  has told of his fairytale rise many times in interviews, shared his  memories of nights in the Champions League, his appearance in the UEFA  Cup Final, the club&#39;s historic treble win, three title victories and  five domestic cup triumphs.</div><div></div><div>His career here also included a Hollywood interlude and a cameo in Robert Duvall&rsquo;s now  infamous Shot at Glory, where he starred in a Rangers team.</div><div></div><div>What  he has never revealed is the full story of his playing career and  arrival here and the fact is he is a living, breathing miracle, lucky to  be here at all, let alone having carved out such a successful career in  professional football.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;The truth is, I should never have played,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I was living on La Reunion and was spotted by a scout from Montpellier.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  had 10 clubs after me but I chose Montpellier because it was in the  south of France, the climate was good and Laurent Robert, who was also  from my island, was already there.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;It was hard  for me at first. We are French on La Reunion island, but are 10,000  kilometres from France and speak Creole, so it was difficult to adapt.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I went for my medical, but they did not see that I had appendicitis and my  appendix exploded. I spent six hours on an operating table and lost 12 kilos in one week.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;When  I recovered I was always injured. It was only when they sent me to see a  professor that they spotted that I didn&rsquo;t have any cartilage in my  right knee. There is no cartilage at all - it&rsquo;s bone to bone.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hereditary, my brother had the same problem but didn&rsquo;t play football and had an operation when he was younger.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  was told if I got the operation, I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to play. I told  them not to do it, so they cleaned out my knee but told me I would never  play at a high level again.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div>That should have  been the end of it and there will be club doctors reading this, trying  to comprehend how Agathe got so far without the problem being spotted in  the first place.</div><div></div><div>He began to negotiate a settlement with his club,  tendering his resignation and one of his brothers flew over to France to help him return home.</div><div></div><div>Deeply  depressed and struggling to accept the decision he did what most would  do and attempted to drown his sorrows. Then, the morning after the night  before, came the crash.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I fell asleep at the  wheel of my car,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;My car went over a fence and landed on a  barrier. My windows were blown out, the airbags went off and I was  stuck, on a quiet road on a Sunday morning with no one around.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;Suddenly an ambulance came along and found me, they were on their way to another accident, saw me and stopped.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;My car was totally destroyed. It was hanging on the edge of the road, over a steep drop. I don&rsquo;t know why it didn&rsquo;t fall.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div>It was during his recovery that he decided to give it one more go, to try somewhere, somehow  to make it as a professional.</div><div></div><div>His career in France was over, the odds were stacked against him, but he was taking a chance, and leaving it entirely to fate.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;This is a true story,&rdquo; he said with a smile. &ldquo;I took a map and took a coin and flipped it. The coin landed on England.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  took everything I had in my flat and sold it. I managed to get together  just over 10,000 Francs. I got a car and took everything I had and  drove to Calais.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I was sleeping in my car at  first but had a friend in Burnley who let me come and stay with him.  Every morning I went running and the money I had, I used to go to the  gym.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;My friend arranged a trial with  Stockport. I went there and it went perfectly. I had my top, with Agathe  on the back and my number, but I failed my medical.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div>By that time his money was almost  out. His family was telling him to return home and was about to give up.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;On  the morning I was about to leave I met a French guy, who just happened  to be over for a trial with Wigan, whose name was Ludovic Pollet.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;We  got talking and he told me, &lsquo;we are playing tonight, come and watch the  game.&rsquo; I went. I had no money, nothing at all and was introduced to his  agent, Phil Black, who introduced me to another agent, whose name was  Willie McKay.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I hardly spoke any English, but  my friend was translating and Willie asked, &lsquo;why don&rsquo;t you come to  Scotland?&rsquo; I answered: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Scotland!?&rsquo; I had no idea!</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  followed Willie all the way up in my old Honda. We arrived in  Motherwell at 11.30pm at night for a trial there. Willie phoned their  manager, Billy Davies, but his wife explained that he was in hospital -  with  appendicitis!</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;Willie said, it&rsquo;s okay, follow me and we drove and drove and at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning we arrived in Kirkcaldy.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div>A  white lie got him in the door at Starks Park, Raith Rovers had lost  their first four games and manager John McVeigh needed a striker.</div><div></div><div>Agathe had never played up front but told the manager he had and scored two in a bounce game against the first team.</div><div></div><div>That weekend, as a trialist against Airdrie, he hit a hat trick.</div><div></div><div>When  his deal ran out at the end of the season he thought he had a club  lined up, but his best offer came from Alex McLeish and Hibs, who  offered him a two-month contract.</div><div></div><div>He  missed an open goal against Hearts on his debut, &lsquo;the worst miss you  will ever see&rsquo;, but McLeish kept faith in him and in August, after  scoring one of the best goals of his career  against Dundee, he caught the eye of Martin O&rsquo;Neill, who was at the  match to watch Rab Douglas.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;A few days later I  got a call and the voice said, &lsquo;Hi, it&rsquo;s Martin.&rsquo; I put the phone down  on him - I thought it was a joke! Luckily he called me back again.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  went for my medical and they spotted my knee straight away, but Martin  said, don&rsquo;t worry it&rsquo;s not a problem. He did the same with John Hartson  too who had problems with his back and I signed that day.</div><div></div><div>O&rsquo;Neill continued to put his faith in Agathe, allowing him to sit out training when his right knee swelled up like a balloon.</div><div></div><div>Even then it took an hour and a half of stretching every morning to loosen up enough to walk.</div><div></div><div>In  his time at Celtic you would struggle to find a player who took as much  joy from the game as Agathe. He had a smile on his face every day at  the club, took time to meet and help supporters and seemed to love  every minute of it.</div><div></div><div>He  was also, without publicity or fanfare, involved in charity works, even  bringing over a group of young players from La Reunion to train at the  club in 2005.</div><div></div><div>That  thread has continued into his retirement and, now 40 years of age, he  is running his own academy on the island and in neighbouring Mauritius  and has helped young players win professional deals in France, Italy,  England and Scotland, all without taking a penny in return.</div><div></div><div>This  partly stems from his faith, an appreciation of what he had and a  determination to try and make sure that his players do not face the same  obstacles he did.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  should never have played but looking back now, I really think it was  God who helped me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain the feeling I had, playing  for  Celtic.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I  was like a child, I felt like I was dreaming, especially when we played  in the Champions League. I always knew how lucky I was to be there. My  first motivation was - give your best and make people happy.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;I dreamed all my life to play and there I was, playing. I was living my passion.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;You realise when you finish how you made people happy. When you are a player people tell you, &lsquo;you are a star, a legend.</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;You  are not, definitely not and I am not just saying this to play games.  Without the people who come and pay to see you play, without your  friends and the staff at the club, without all these people who believe  in you, you are nothing.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div>With a glance at his watch the interview ends. Agathe has to pick up his player, Yoel, who has just finished training.</div><div></div><div>Do his players know, did  anyone outside his family ever know, what he had came through to get there?</div><div></div><div>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I have never told them.&rdquo;</div><div></div><div>Finally, the story is out.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>  Didier Agathe : &laquo;&thinsp;Le Old Firm m&#39;a contraint &agrave; d&eacute;m&eacute;nager neuf fois en un an&thinsp;&raquo;<br></h3>http://www.sofoot.com/didier-agathe-le-old-firm-m-a-contraint-a-demenager-neuf-fois-en-un-an-451197.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitterFl&egrave;che dans le couloir droit du Celtic pendant six saisons, Didier Agathe (42 ans) est maintenant rentr&eacute; sur son &icirc;le natale de la R&eacute;union.

En &Eacute;cosse, le Old Firm fait toujours un record d&rsquo;audience sur les cha&icirc;nes t&eacute;l&eacute;. Il est aussi retransmis dans les pays arabes, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis car les supporters des deux &eacute;quipes sont nombreux sur tout le globe.

On voit des grands-parents venir avec leurs petits-fils dans une opposition entre catholiques et protestants.

Des joueurs qu&rsquo;ils payaient assez grassement d&rsquo;ailleurs, &ccedil;a leur a co&ucirc;t&eacute; la rel&eacute;gation.

Nous avons marqu&eacute; l&rsquo;histoire du club.La ficheDidier AgatheN&eacute; le 16 ao&ucirc;t 1975 &agrave; Saint-Pierre (La R&eacute;union)AttaquantClubs : Montpellier HSC (1995-1996), Olympique Al&egrave;s (1996-1997), Montpellier HSC (1997-1999), Raith Rovers (1999-2000), Hibernian FC (2000), Celtic FC (2000-2006), Aston Villa (2006-2007)Palmar&egrave;s : Championnat &Eacute;cossais (2001, 2002, 2004)Coupe d&#39;&Eacute;cosse (2001, 2004, 2005)Et sur le terrain, comment &ccedil;a se passe ?Les joueurs se laissent compl&egrave;tement prendre par l&rsquo;enjeu et toute la semaine qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de la rencontre, c&rsquo;est du brainstorming. Les supporters vont toujours te dire qu&rsquo;ils pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent perdre contre la Juventus, le Bar&ccedil;a ou peu importe l&rsquo;&eacute;quipe. Le seul match qu&rsquo;il faut gagner, c&rsquo;est celui face aux Rangers. Et dans les deux &eacute;quipes, tu vas avoir des joueurs assez fragiles dans leur t&ecirc;te qui, lorsque le match ne tourne pas en leur faveur, se mettent &agrave; partir dans des d&eacute;rives avec des tacles d&rsquo;une extr&ecirc;me violence. Quand tu mises tout sur un match et que tu le perds, certains peuvent p&eacute;ter les plombs.Tous les joueurs qui ont particip&eacute; &agrave; ce derby disent &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s la m&ecirc;me chose que toi. Quels sont tes souvenirs tr&egrave;s personnels de ce match ?J&rsquo;en ai tellement... Le Old Firm m&#39;a contraint &agrave; d&eacute;m&eacute;nager neuf fois en une seule saison. Un jour, des mecs des Rangers ont cass&eacute; ma voiture parce que nous avions remport&eacute; tous les titres possibles au niveau national. Une autre fois, on m&rsquo;a envoy&eacute; des menaces de mort &agrave; mon domicile, donc j&rsquo;utilisais un fourgon blind&eacute; pour aller m&rsquo;entra&icirc;ner. J&rsquo;en ai une autre : je suis de religion catholique donc signer dans ce club, je le voyais comme un vrai signe. Nous &eacute;tions dans la p&eacute;riode de Car&ecirc;me, vers f&eacute;vrier-mars. Un Old Firm &eacute;tait pr&eacute;vu en fin de semaine.&laquo;&thinsp;Pendant tout le match, Ibrox Park chantait &quot;Agathe loves curry ! Agathe loves curry !&quot; &agrave; chaque fois que je touchais le ballon. C&#39;&eacute;tait fou...&thinsp;&raquo;J&rsquo;&eacute;tais pass&eacute; dans un restaurant indien tr&egrave;s connu &agrave; Glasgow, o&ugrave; je mange de fa&ccedil;on normale en respectant les r&egrave;gles de ma religion. Deux jours apr&egrave;s, j&rsquo;arrive &agrave; l&rsquo;entra&icirc;nement en voiture. 300 personnes nous attendent pour qu&rsquo;on leur signe des autographes. L&agrave;, un mec me parle et me dit qu&rsquo;il est journaliste. On avait pour consigne de ne parler &agrave; aucun m&eacute;dia, donc je lui dis que j&rsquo;ai entra&icirc;nement. Apr&egrave;s avoir pris ma douche, je vois qu&rsquo;il est toujours l&agrave;. Je termine ma journ&eacute;e et je sors faire des courses. Il est devant chez moi... Au bout d&rsquo;un moment, je lui dis de demander l&rsquo;autorisation au club pour me parler. Et l&agrave;, il me dit : &laquo;&thinsp;C&rsquo;est en rapport avec le restaurant indien. Pourquoi est-ce que vous &ecirc;tes all&eacute; l&agrave;-bas ?&thinsp;&raquo; Je ne lui r&eacute;ponds pas. Le jour du derby en premi&egrave;re page, le quotidien avait titr&eacute; &laquo;&thinsp;Agathe profite !&thinsp;&raquo; en exhibant une fausse note qui montrait que j&rsquo;avais command&eacute; des dizaines de plats... C&rsquo;&eacute;tait n&rsquo;importe quoi ! Et pendant tout le match, Ibrox Park chantait &laquo;&thinsp;Agathe loves curry ! Agathe loves curry !&thinsp;&raquo; &agrave; chaque fois que je touchais le ballon. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait fou...Deco sans Val&eacute;rie DamidotAvec tes bonnes performances au Celtic, Berti Vogts songeait &agrave; t&rsquo;appeler en s&eacute;lection &eacute;cossaise, mais le public s&rsquo;y opposait. Comment as-tu v&eacute;cu cet &eacute;pisode ?Sur le coup, bien s&ucirc;r que j&rsquo;aurais aim&eacute; jouer pour l&rsquo;&Eacute;cosse. Cela n&rsquo;avait rien &agrave; voir avec le racisme, mais je me suis dit que le fait d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre le seul black de l&rsquo;&eacute;quipe nationale et d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre un naturalis&eacute;, cela pouvait d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rer si &ccedil;a tournait mal. Je pouvais passer &agrave; la casserole. Disons que j&rsquo;ai anticip&eacute; les choses de mani&egrave;re n&eacute;gative, car je savais qu&rsquo;une partie du public, notamment celui des Rangers, n&rsquo;&eacute;tait pas favorable &agrave; me voir jouer sous ce maillot. Et puis m&rsquo;alourdir le calendrier avec des matchs internationaux, en sachant que j&rsquo;ai fait toute ma carri&egrave;re sans cartilage aux genoux, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait aussi risqu&eacute;.Au Celtic, tu as jou&eacute; avec la l&eacute;gende Henrik Larsson...Pfff... Honn&ecirc;tement, c&rsquo;est exceptionnel. Les gamins, tu peux les faire travailler sur les courses, les appels, les contre-appels. Mais sentir le but, c&rsquo;est inn&eacute;. Henrik, il terminait ses saisons &agrave; 48 buts. Alors certes, on va dire que c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;&Eacute;cosse, un championnat facile, blablabla...&laquo;&thinsp;Je me souviens d&#39;avoir d&eacute;livr&eacute; la passe d&eacute;cisive &agrave; Henrik Larsson pour son denier but au Celtic Park. Quand il marque, il vient dans mes bras et se met &agrave; pleurer. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait beau.&thinsp;&raquo;Dans tous les championnats, tu as deux ou trois pr&eacute;tendants r&eacute;els pour le titre. La seule diff&eacute;rence dans ce championnat, c&rsquo;est que le gouffre entre le duo Celtic-Rangers et les autres clubs est &eacute;norme. Mais malgr&eacute; tout, quand tu voyais la fa&ccedil;on dont Henrik empilait ses buts et qu&rsquo;&agrave; l&rsquo;entra&icirc;nement, la premi&egrave;re chose qu&rsquo;il demandait au coach c&rsquo;&eacute;tait de travailler face au but, je me disais que ce mec &eacute;tait fou. En match, quand je centrais, que ce soit au premier ou au second poteau, il &eacute;tait l&agrave;. En tant que co&eacute;quipier, Henrik nous surprenait au moment de marquer dans un angle impossible, de sentir la bonne passe, le bon appel. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait un buteur, mais aussi un formidable presseur de d&eacute;fense. Et quand il s&rsquo;est d&eacute;cid&eacute; &agrave; partir du Celtic, il a su s&rsquo;imposer au FC Barcelone et &agrave; Manchester United. C&rsquo;est la preuve de son immense talent. Je me souviens de lui avoir d&eacute;livr&eacute; la passe d&eacute;cisive pour son denier but au Celtic Park. Quand il marque, il vient dans mes bras et se met &agrave; pleurer. C&rsquo;&eacute;tait beau.En 2005-2006, ton coach devient Gordon Strachan, un personnage avec un tr&egrave;s fort caract&egrave;re. Quel type d&rsquo;entra&icirc;neur &eacute;tait-il avec toi ?J&rsquo;ai beaucoup appris avec Martin O&rsquo;Neill sur le plan humain.&laquo;&thinsp;Strachan avait fait venir un arri&egrave;re droit qui s&rsquo;appelait Paul Telfer, un type mari&eacute; &agrave; sa fille. Voil&agrave;...&thinsp;&raquo;C&rsquo;&eacute;tait du vrai management, &agrave; parler avec les joueurs, cr&eacute;er un esprit de camaraderie, il te faisait sentir &ccedil;a. Strachan, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait tout le contraire. D&eacute;j&agrave;, il avait fait venir un arri&egrave;re droit qui s&rsquo;appelait Paul Telfer, un type mari&eacute; &agrave; sa fille. Voil&agrave;... D&egrave;s le premier entra&icirc;nement, je suis all&eacute; au clash avec lui parce que je m&rsquo;&eacute;tais bless&eacute; alors qu&rsquo;il m&rsquo;avait dit de m&rsquo;entra&icirc;ner contre l&rsquo;avis des kin&eacute;s... Il &eacute;tait complex&eacute; par rapport &agrave; son pr&eacute;d&eacute;cesseur. Tr&egrave;s franchement, je n&rsquo;ai rien appris avec lui, et je ne dis pas &ccedil;a parce que je n&rsquo;ai pas jou&eacute;. Gordon, c&rsquo;est vraiment tout ce que le football ne doit pas produire. Tu sens qu&rsquo;il est l&agrave; par &eacute;go&iuml;sme et non pour transmettre quelque chose.Vid&eacute;oTu as termin&eacute; ta carri&egrave;re professionnelle &agrave; Aston Villa. Est-ce que tu aurais aim&eacute; jouer dans des championnats plus latins ?Quand j&#39;&eacute;tais &agrave; Aston Villa, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait la fin de ma carri&egrave;re. J&rsquo;avais tellement mal aux genoux que je ne pouvais plus me lever pour aller aux entra&icirc;nements. &Eacute;videmment, conna&icirc;tre l&rsquo;Italie ou l&rsquo;Espagne aurait &eacute;t&eacute; magnifique, mais quand j&rsquo;ai jou&eacute; des matchs de Ligue des champions avec le Celtic, j&rsquo;ai pu &eacute;changer mes maillots avec ceux de Del Piero, Kak&aacute;... Je dis mille fois merci &agrave; la vie d&rsquo;avoir pu m&rsquo;offrir de tels moments au cours de ma carri&egrave;re. Vivre &ccedil;a, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait le top.Que penses-tu du niveau du Celtic avec Brendan Rodgers comme entra&icirc;neur ?Brendan, c&rsquo;est vraiment un mec que j&rsquo;aime. D&eacute;j&agrave; dans sa fa&ccedil;on de jouer, parce qu&rsquo;il va vers l&rsquo;avant. M&ecirc;me si contre le PSG, il fallait rester derri&egrave;re et attendre l&rsquo;adversaire, ce n&rsquo;&eacute;tait pas son style. Il aime produire, jouer.&laquo;&thinsp;Je crois que le Celtic va r&eacute;v&eacute;ler au monde une des futures grandes stars du football : Karamoko Demb&eacute;l&eacute;. Les gens ne le connaissent pas encore tr&egrave;s bien, car il n&#39;a que 14 ans.&thinsp;&raquo;Humainement, j&rsquo;ai eu l&rsquo;occasion de le rencontrer lors d&rsquo;un match de charit&eacute;. Il est venu me voir et m&rsquo;a attrap&eacute; par le bras pour me dire qu&rsquo;il &eacute;tait fan du Celtic depuis tout petit. L&agrave;, je me suis dit que ce genre de gars devait finir par coacher le Celtic. Quand tu aimes le club, tu vas faire du bon boulot. Aussi, je crois que le Celtic va r&eacute;v&eacute;ler au monde une des futures grandes stars du football : Karamoko Demb&eacute;l&eacute;. Les gens ne le connaissent pas encore tr&egrave;s bien, car il n&rsquo;a que 14 ans, mais attention, c&rsquo;est un ph&eacute;nom&egrave;ne.Avant ton passage au Celtic, tu incarnes, dans le film Un but pour la gloire de Michael Corrente, un joueur des Rangers. Est-ce une chose que tu regrettes aujourd&#39;hui ?Non, cela reste tr&egrave;s positif. Tu sais, je suis du genre &agrave; me dire que m&ecirc;me dans les pires moments de ma vie, j&rsquo;apprends. Nous sommes l&agrave; pour cela. Nous sommes de passage. Quand des &eacute;preuves nous font chuter, il faut se relever pour continuer d&rsquo;avancer. Quand j&rsquo;&eacute;tais footballeur, je r&eacute;alisais que les gens travaillaient toute la semaine pour se payer leur abonnement au stade et venaient te voir jouer. De ton c&ocirc;t&eacute;, tu dois donner le maximum pour qu&rsquo;ils soient heureux quand ils ressortent du stade. Au Celtic Park, je voyais parfois des aveugles ou des malentendants nous acclamer. Ce qu&rsquo;il faut garder en toute circonstance, c&rsquo;est l&rsquo;amour. Le Celtic ne m&rsquo;a jamais reproch&eacute; d&rsquo;avoir tourn&eacute; ce film, et je ne peux que remercier l&rsquo;&eacute;quipe du tournage pour m&rsquo;avoir fait conna&icirc;tre le cin&eacute;ma. D&rsquo;ailleurs, je crois avoir mang&eacute; mon premier fish &amp; chips avec eux, c&rsquo;&eacute;tait un super souvenir ! (Rires.)
