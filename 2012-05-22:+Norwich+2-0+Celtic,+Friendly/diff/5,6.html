And the defender came close to scoring inside  just six minutes but Kelvin Wilson cleared the ball inside the box,  which sparked a chorus of jeers from the home support.<br><br>The  Norwich fans were desperate to see the main man get a goal but it was  Vaughan who opened the scoring. He collected the ball inside the penalty  box, and from 12-yards out, the striker slotted it past Forster.<br><br>The  atmosphere continued to grow inside the stadium with both sets of fans  in full voice, and they continued to respond to each other&rsquo;s songs  throughout the first half.<br><br>Tony Watt had a string of chances for  the Hoops, but wasn&rsquo;t able to execute them cleanly in front of goal.  Andre Blackman did well to attack from left-back while Rubiu Ibrahim was  trying hard to impress.<br><br>Norwich continued to look sharp with  every attack, though, and came close to doubling their advantage on 41  minutes. Forster cleared the ball off the line but Vaughan responded  with a powerful rebound, only to see it crack off the woodwork.<br><br>Watt  had another opportunity to equalise just before the break when he made  an excellent run past Elliott Ward, but he failed at the final hurdle  when his cross was too weak to cause Jed Steer any problems.<br><br>After  the break Celtic emerged with the same side, but Norwich had made nine  changes, with a 10th being made seven minutes later.<br><br>Watt  continued to search for the equaliser and drilled an excellent volley on  goal, but it was tipped over the bar by substitute keeper, Declan Rudd.<br><br>Findlay,  who had been one of the stand-out performers of the evening, then made a  fantastic headed clearance in front of goal just minutes later. But it  was a string of defensive mistakes which lead to Norwich&rsquo;s second goal.<br><br>A  poor clearance by Forster was picked up at the edge of the box on 69  minutes. Kelvin Wilson failed to clear the ball, by kicking it off of  the Celtic keeper and as a result, Lansbury slotted it home before  Blackman could clear it off the line.<br><br>All five substitutes,  Robbie Thomson, Denny Johnstone, Jamie Lindsay, Lewis Kidd and Paddy  McNally made their first-team bow midway in the second-half and each did  well on their debut.<br><br>But it wasn&rsquo;t enough to pull two goals back  and share the spoils as Norwich finished the mach 2-0 winners, despite a  strong and well composed performance by Celtic.<br><br>NORWICH (first-half) (4-2-2-2): Steer; Naughton, Barnett, Ward, Drury; Johnson, Howson; E.

I spent eight brilliant years there, and a big thanks to Neil Lennon and Celtic for coming down for a player that I think deserves a game and atmosphere like that.<br><br>&quot;I think that was a special night for him, and fitting for someone who has had 11 years at the Football Club, and who has been absolutely terrific for me.&quot;<br><br>Drury added: &quot;It&#39;s hard to put into words to be honest. Obviously I&#39;ve heard what an atmosphere Celtic fans create, the gaffer had told me and the Scottish lads, but until you actually see it... from start to finish they are non-stop.<br><br>&quot;Norwich fans were first class as well, they joined in with it, and it will take a while to sink in.&quot;<br><br>Adam Drury Testimonial<br>STANDING OVATION: The Yellow Army show their appreciation for Club legend Adam Drury&#39;s 11 years of service.<br><br>In the 7th minute there was nearly a fairytale start to proceedings as Wes Hoolahan found Drury and the man of the moment jinked into the box only to be denied a shooting chance but a last-ditch tackle in the box.<br><br>Jed Steer showed good awareness in the 14th minute to tip over a useful long-range effort from Tony Watt from 25 yards.<br><br>In the 18th minute Celtic fans entertained us with a superb &#39;huddle&#39; (think Man City fans doing the &#39;Poznan&#39;) which was warmly applauded by the City faithful - who promptly responded with a &#39;Mexican huddle&#39; which travelled right round the stadium a minute later after the Canaries took the lead.<br><br>The goal came after good work from Wes Hoolahan on the left, the Irishman carving out space for himself before picking out the run of Vaughan, who fired home first time from ten yards.<br><br>In fact it was a bright performance from City going forward with Hoolahan and Elliott Bennett providing good outlets for the Canaries as well as man of the moment Drury on the left putting in balls for Holt and Vaughan to try and get on the end of. One such ball providing a bit of banter between the City skipper and former stopper Forster - Holt bundling his ex-team-mate into the back of the net in an attempt to force a goal to the amusement of all, including the Hoops&#39; &#39;keeper.<br><br>Half-time: Norwich City 1, Celtic 0<br><br>Paul Lambert and Neil Lennon<br>OLD FRIENDS: Former team-mates at Celtic Paul Lambert and Neil Lennon faced each other in the dugout for the first time.<br><br>In the 52nd minute there was a huge ovation for Kyle Naughton, returning to Spurs after a great season on loan with City, as he made way for youngster Francomb.<br><br>The lively Tony Watt forced Declan Rudd into a great reaction save in the 61st minute, the young City stopper tipping over his fierce angled drive.<br><br>A minute later the ground rose as one as Simon Lappin came on for Drury, Celtic and Norwich fans united in their ovation for the City legend, leaving to change in time for post-match activities on the pitch.<br><br>With just over 20 minutes to go City doubled their lead when Henri Lansbury picked up a good ball from Fox and slotted home from a tight angle after Forster blocked his first effort.<br><br>In the 75th minute there was a double ovation around the stadium. First the applause was for Aaron Wilbraham, leaving the Carrow Road pitch for the last time in City colours. The second was for his replacement, City legend Darren Huckerby.<br><br>And after a brilliant interchange with Surman in the 84th minute Huckerby was only denied a memorable goal by a superb reaction save from Forster.<br><br>Full-time: Norwich City 2, Celtic 0<br><br>CITY: Steer, Drury, Johnson, Vaughan, Holt, Hoolahan, E. Bennett, Barnett, Ward, Howson, Naughton. Subs and second half: Rudd, Nelson, Lansbury, Pacheco, Surman, Pilkington, Fox, Wilbraham, Francomb, R. Bennett, Smith, Lappin, Huckerby.<br><br>CELTIC: Forster, McGeough, Wilson, Findlay, Blackman, Ibrahim, Commons, McCourt, Watt, Hooper, Stokes.

Obviously I&#39;ve heard what an atmosphere Celtic fans create, the gaffer had told me, the Scottish lads have told me, but until you&#39;re in the ground and you actually see it&hellip;. from start to finish they were non-stop.<br><br>&quot;The Norwich fans were first-class too, they joined it with it and it was an unreal night that will take a while to sink in.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not just the people on the pitch, but everyone around the ground that has put in so much hard work, I can&#39;t thank them enough.<br><br>&quot;The work that has gone in to putting the game together is unbelievable.&quot;<br><br>Adam Drury is welcomed out onto the Carrow Road pitch for his Testimonial game<br>BIG DAY: Adam Drury and his children receive a guard of honour.<br><br>City ran out 2-0 winners on the night, with goals from James Vaughan and former loanee Henri Lansbury, who was joined by Dani Pacheco, Michael Nelson, and Darren Huckerby in the squad.<br><br>It was also the first time that Celtic Manager Neil Lennon, and Paul Lambert, Celtic&#39;s former captain who was team-mates with Lennon at Parkhead, have faced each other in the dugout.<br><br>Paul Lambert and Neil Lennon<br>HEAD-TO-HEAD: Celtic Manager Neil Lennon with former team-mate Paul Lambert.<br><br>Drury added: &quot;It was a pretty quick pace in the game as well, and that made for a better spectacle for everyone to watch and hopefully everyone enjoyed it.<br><br>&quot;I turned around at one point and, I think it&#39;s called the &#39;Poznan&#39;, and the whole ground was doing it.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve had a few people saying to me &#39;did you see it&#39;? And I think I spent more time watching that than I did the game.<br><br>&quot;I imagine it was great viewing. We&#39;ve had a few lads come back, obviously Dani Pacheco has flown in from Spain, Darren Huckerby has come out of retirement, and then you&#39;ve got Michael Nelson and Henri Lansbury too.<br><br>&quot;It was brilliant for them to come back and play in the game because they didn&#39;t have to, and thanks to their clubs for allowing it, and to our lads for missing their holidays to play in the game!<br><br>&quot;I said to my wife beforehand that I was worried I might shed a few tears and that I might get a bit of stick off the lads if I did.<br><br>&quot;But I managed to fight them back [on the pitch at the end] and yeah I thoroughly enjoyed it and it&#39;s a chance to say thank you to the Celtic fans that have travelled through the night to be here, and obviously to all these Norwich fans that have turned out on a Tuesday evening for a game for me.&quot;  <br><br><br><br><h3><span class="diffAdd">  You have to salute the Celtic hordes; they are a breed apart. That said, we proud North Folk need to stay true to our own roots&hellip;</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">Sun 27 May 12 by Latest News</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">http://norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com/2012/05/27/you-have-to-salute-the-celtic-hordes-they-are-a-breed-apart-that-said-we-proud-north-folk-need-to-stay-true-to-our-own-roots/</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Scattered beer cans and sore heads were, no doubt, the order of the day last Wednesday morning as the city blinked its bleary eyes and slowly attempted to recall the events of the previous night, writes Gary Gowers.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that, if nothing else, Tuesday night&rsquo;s Norfolk invasion by the Celtic masses gave us all some light relief from the negativity that has pervaded City related message boards and social media over the last week or so.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The whole evening was an undoubted triumph for all concerned &ndash; not least for the star of the show, Adam Drury &ndash; whose wish for a &lsquo;party atmosphere&rsquo; was followed to the letter by the 4,000 &lsquo;invaders&rsquo;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Such was the infectious nature of the Celtic following we were treated to the unusual Carrow Road phenomenon of &lsquo;audience participation&rsquo; from the Geoffrey Watling stand &ndash; their unbridled version of the Celtic Huddle, as they joined in with the rest of the ground, presented an image that will remain in the minds of those present for quite some time (note: Huddle, not Poznan, as our Scottish friends were very quick to point out!).</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">What on earth would dear old Geoffrey himself have made of it?</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The game itself, whilst largely irrelevant, was unusually competitive for a Testimonial &ndash; although given the combination of a team managed by Paul Lambert and a passionate and fervent visiting support bigger than other seen at Carrow Road this season, then I guess we shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">For Celtic to bring such a huge travelling support for what was really nothing more than an end-of-season friendly was astonishing although, again, we shouldn&rsquo;t have been surprised &ndash; after all, their following for Tim Sheppard&rsquo;s 2001 Testimonial was equally as passionate and possibly even greater in number.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Ever since Ms Smith&rsquo;s ever so slightly embarrassing &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s be havin&rsquo; you!&rsquo; rant back in 2005, I think a few of us have been fooled into thinking we actually are the best fans in the world.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Please think again folks &ndash; yes, on our day we can put on a decent show and there&rsquo;s no denying that our away support is right up there with the best that the Premier League has to offer.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But compared to those clad in green and white hoops, if we&rsquo;re really honest, we seriously have to &lsquo;up our game&rsquo; to even get close to emulating that wall of Glaswegian sound.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I jest of course &ndash; in reality there&rsquo;s no way we would ever be able to recreate that same embedded unity and passion that they display, particularly given that their united beliefs lie far deeper than supporting just a football team.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Such was the sense joy on display on a balmy Norfolk Tuesday night we were all prepared to overlook the odd sectarian chant &ndash; but in truth it is these songs, even more so than those of the footballing variety, that bond this mass of Scottish folk together so unconditionally.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The closest we can get is the odd raw, raucous, heartfelt (and spontaneous) version of On The Ball City, which does still retain the ability to make the hairs on the back of the neck stand up.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The Fields of Athenrye and You&rsquo;ll Never Walk Alone clearly have a similar effect on the Celtic faithful, and also anyone else in earshot &ndash; or perhaps it was just me. And the song about Paddy McCourt has led me to the brink of emailing Neil Lennon to implore him not to sell!</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">(Does anyone know when/why Celtic and Liverpool formally traded those two songs?).</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Some argue that On The Ball City is something of a dirge, but to all those doubters &ndash; be proud that we have a song that resonates so deeply with us, and us alone.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Yes, it may be considered a bit of a dirge, but it&rsquo;s our dirge and never should anyone even contemplate replacing. Add to it with some new, uniquely Norwich songs by all means, but please never lose it.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The melodramatic part of me wants to say it&rsquo;s part of who we are. Many clubs, and I&rsquo;m not looking too far afield here, have no songs that are unique to them and in my view are much the poorer for it.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Whilst I&rsquo;m not expecting to hear On The Ball City belted out regularly at Parkhead next season (wouldn&rsquo;t work would it?), I do wonder if the bond forged between the Celtic and City supporters as a result of last Tuesday&rsquo;s &lsquo;party&rsquo; will be more enduring than your average holiday romance &ndash; I certainly hope it is.  </span><br><br></div>
