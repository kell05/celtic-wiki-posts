That was important.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#39;s a monumental achievement by the players.&quot; Brendan Rodgers<br><br>(Tinsoldier of KDS)<br> 						 						 						 					 					 						I&#39;ve not felt like this about a Celtic side since MON&#39;s days.  Everything just seems so right; the support has been galvanised by  Brendan&#39;s appointment, players who looked out of place under the  previous regime are flourishing, the style of football is fantastic, and  of course the glorious unbeaten run. <br><br>Our manager knows exactly  that; how to manage. Whether that is manage individual talents or the  expectations of the support, he is an expert. We are lucky to have him.<br><br>I feckin&#39; love this club of ours<br><br><br>(SilentW of KDS)<br>Glad and relieved they made it. Would have been more gutted about losing  this than the cup final, since this is a monument that will be  reflected on for ages. Some future Bob Crampsey will respond to a reader  question thus : <br><br>&quot;In 2016/7 Celtic went through the entire  league campaign unbeaten, dropping points in only 4 out of 38 games.  What&#39;s more, in each of those drawn games, Celtic led and by all  accounts should have won, thereby coming very close to completing a 100%  league record.&quot;<br><br>A great time to be part of the Celtic family. Indeed, the togetherness is reminiscent of the Centenary season.<br><br>(Canneloni of KDS)<br>We&#39;ve been behind 4 times this season in games. Also to note we have come back and won all these games.<br><br>We were down for 3 mins to a Coulibaly wonder strike at Celtic Park against Killie. Final score 6-1<br><br>We were down twice against Motherwell for a total of 36 mins. Before Rogic sealed a cracking winner in time added on. <br><br>Next we were down to bawbag strike at ibrox for 21 mins until moussa hunskelper equalised. We won 2-1<br><br>Finally we were down for 18 mins against St Johnstone after Boyatas OG. We won 5-2.<br><br>So I make that 78 mins for the entire season.<br><br>On  a side note we led 36/38 matches going into the last 10 minutes. We  lost 6 points by drawing 3 games when conceding in the last 3 minutes  each time. The other draw was home to Patrick Thistle where we missed a  penalty. This is not a criticism more to point out how close we were to  winning every game.

first Ladbrokes Premiership season as manager with a host of Scottish league records.<br><br>Here, we round up their achievements in numbers.<br>106 &ndash; Celtic set a new record points total for the Scottish league. Their 2-0 win over Hearts ensured they finished the campaign on 106 points, beating the previous mark of 103, which was set by Martin O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Celtic side in 2002.<br><br>34 &ndash; The Hoops secured a record number of victories in a Scottish league season thanks to their win against Hearts, which took them past the 33-victory total that they achieved in 2001-02. Rangers also won 33 games in both 1991-92 and 1992-93 but had 44 games to do so rather than the 38 of Celtic.<br><br>106 &ndash; Celtic matched their points tally with their haul of goals. Stuart Armstrong&rsquo;s late effort against Hearts took them past the 105 goals scored by O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s side in 2001-02, which was the previous best in the Premier era. Celtic&rsquo;s famous Lisbon Lions team scored 111 in 1966-67 before league reconstruction.<br><br>38 &ndash; Rodgers&rsquo; side set a new, unbeatable run of games without defeat in a single season. The previous best had been a 32-match unbeaten run, set by O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s Celtic side in the 2003-04 campaign. It was the first unbeaten season in the Scottish top flight since 1899, when Rangers matched Celtic&rsquo;s achievement of the previous year, but the campaign was only 18 games long in those days.<br><br>30 &ndash; The Parkhead side secured the biggest margin of points in Scottish football. Celtic won the league by 30 points from Aberdeen, who secured their own highest-ever tally of 76. It beat the 29-point margin which Celtic managed in 2013-14 when Neil Lennon&rsquo;s side finished well clear of Motherwell. But it was one short of regaining the European record, which Paris St Germain set last season.  <br><br><br>  Celtic 2 - 0 Hearts: Champions become &lsquo;The Invincibles&rsquo;<br><br>Leigh Griffiths nods past Viktor Noring for the game&#39;s only goal. Picture: SNS <br>STEPHEN HALLIDAY TheScotsman<br>Celtic Park has never hosted a title party quite like this. In a season when they seem to have set more records than Usain Bolt, Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; all-conquering side became the first team to complete a top-flight league campaign unbeaten for 118 years<br>Keep up to date with all our sport news on The Scotsman&rsquo;s Sport page on Facebook<br>They are the first to do so in the modern era, wrapping up their Premiership programme yesterday with the 34th win of the 38-game campaign &ndash; another landmark.<br>The scaling of fresh heights didn&rsquo;t stop there. Their total of 106 points eclipses the mark of 103 set by Martin O&rsquo;Neill in 2001-02, while, with a neat symmetry, the strikes from Leigh Griffiths and Stuart Armstrong which eventually saw off a stubborn Hearts side also took them to 106 league goals, beating the 105 netted by O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s squad in 2003-04.<br>All that now remains to turn an outstanding season into a truly historic one is the challenge of next Saturday&rsquo;s Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen, when victory would bring not only the domestic treble but the accolade of becoming the first team in Scottish football history to complete a domestic season undefeated in all competitions.<br>It wasn&rsquo;t a vintage display by Rodgers&rsquo; side yesterday by any means, but that was of little consequence in the greater scheme of things on an occasion when the Celtic support came to celebrate the ruthlessly consistent efficiency Rodgers has brought to their club.<br>His team were worthy winners in the end, courtesy of a much improved second-half performance which eventually saw them exert their superiority over Ian Cathro&rsquo;s team. <br>Celtic had made a curious and uncharacteristically tepid start to the contest from which they subsequently found it difficult to gather the kind of attacking momentum which has been the hallmark of their dominant campaign.<br>Hearts, with 19-year-old Jamie Brandon handed his debut as right wing-back in a compact 3-5-2 formation, understandably arrived with containment in mind but their strategy was not wholly lacking in ambition.<br>Cathro&rsquo;s men actually created the first opening of the afternoon. Bjorn Johnsen, retaining his place in the side despite his midweek bust up with the head coach, was unable to connect cleanly enough with his header when picked out by Don Cowie&rsquo;s inviting cross in the second minute.<br>READ MORE - In pictures: Celtic celebrate lifting league trophy<br>A free-kick from Griffiths ruffled the outside of Viktor Noring&rsquo;s net, while Kieran Tierney fired narrowly over from 25 yards, but Celtic were finding it problematic to cut open their obdurate opponents.<br>Hearts looked threatening on the counter, teasing a number of free-kicks from the Celtic defence in promising positions. Alexandros Tziolis came close to giving the visitors the lead from one of them in the 27th minute. It was played short to him by Johnsen and the Greek midfielder&rsquo;s sweetly struck shot rose just over.<br>Celtic gradually worked up a head of steam which was sufficient to place Hearts on the back foot for a sustained spell for the first time. It took a terrific reaction save from Noring to prevent Dedryck Boyata putting the hosts in front when he connected with a Griffiths corner from close range.<br>But Hearts, who came close again from a set piece just before the interval when Johnsen&rsquo;s effort drifted just wide of Craig Gordon&rsquo;s left-hand post, would have felt the more contented side going into the dressing rooms at half-time.<br>Rodgers didn&rsquo;t waste any time making a change, starting the second half with midfielder Tom &not;Rogic on in place of right-back Cristian Gamboa. It was Celtic&rsquo;s switch to a three-man defence and the alteration in shape took just five minutes to bring a dividend.<br>Patrick Roberts, making the last Celtic Park appearance of his loan spell from Manchester City which expires next month, was the creator. The winger showed some typically sharp footwork to make space on the right for a cross which was met with a firm and decisive close-range header by Griffiths.<br>Liam Smith picked up a caution for a foul on the increasingly influential Roberts as the tempo of Celtic&rsquo;s play began to reach the kind of levels their support have become accustomed to under Rodgers&rsquo; tenure.<br>Noring made another decent save, this time keeping out a snapshot from Scott Brown as the champions went in pursuit of the goal which would break the record.<br>The flares mindlessly lit by a group of supporters in the safe standing area of the stadium would have been an unwelcome sight for Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell on a day which was otherwise one of undiluted celebration. But when the smoke cleared, Celtic illuminated the afternoon with their landmark 106th league goal of the season.<br>Griffiths burrowed his way down the right and delivered a cross the Hearts defence were unable to clear. The ball broke into the path of Armstrong who drove his shot high into the net.<br>Boyata flashed a header just wide as Celtic looked to finish with a flourish but Hearts, to their credit, remained competitive and committed to attack. They were unfortunate not to pull a goal back when Johnsen&rsquo;s header hit a post, before Gordon made a brilliant save to deny substitute Malaury Martin. <br><br><br><br>Brendan Rodgers pays tribute to Celtic &lsquo;infrangibles&rsquo;<br><br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers with the Ladbrokes Premiership trophy. Picture: SNS <br>GAVIN McCAFFERTY<br>TheScotsman<br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers paid tribute to his &ldquo;infrangibles&rdquo; after they finished the Ladbrokes Premiership campaign unbeaten with a 2-0 victory over Hearts.<br>Keep up to date with all our sport news on The Scotsman&rsquo;s Sport page on Facebook<br>Stuart Armstrong understood it but I did actually say, &lsquo;for those of you who don&rsquo;t understand I wrote the meaning below&rsquo;. So &lsquo;to be unbroken&rsquo;, that is another word for their vocabulary.<br>Brendan Rodgers <br>A run of 34 victories and four draws sealed a record 106-point tally as Celtic won their sixth title in a row.<br>Second-half goals from Leigh Griffiths and Stuart Armstrong sealed a fitting end to Celtic&rsquo;s dominant league season before they lifted the trophy at Parkhead.<br>Rodgers has generally avoided talking about the prospect of going a Scottish league campaign unbeaten for the first time since both Celtic and Rangers did so in the late 1890s, but it played a central part in his team talk. <br>&ldquo;The word I said to them was infrangible,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That was the word I wrote up on the paper.<br>&ldquo;Stuart Armstrong understood it but I did actually say, &lsquo;for those of you who don&rsquo;t understand I wrote the meaning below&rsquo;. So &lsquo;to be unbroken&rsquo;, that is another word for their vocabulary.&rdquo;<br>Rodgers added: &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t really been a key feature up until probably Thursday night. Because there are so many things that are out of our control in this type of situation.<br>&ldquo;But the players had arrived with a couple of games to go and then it&rsquo;s real, you can&rsquo;t hide from it. You have a chance to go through a whole season and not be beaten.<br>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s how we did it. The level of football, the tactical discipline and excitement they have given supporters has been incredible to watch. And they now stand alone in history.&rdquo;<br>The 44-year-old, whose side scored 106 goals, added: &ldquo;You only have to look at the past, 100 years or so since it was done in the 1890s, to tell you the difficulty of achieving that.<br>READ MORE - John Collins: Patrick Roberts is better than Raheem Sterling<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monumental achievement by the players and I think what gets lost in all the records and everything that is set, there is a real dedication to excellence they have shown since I have come in, in their life, how they have worked hard every day.<br>&ldquo;They will probably tell you themselves, they get pushed very, very hard, and hopefully they see the benefits.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a remarkable achievement for the football club and for this group of players and they will scribe their name into the history of this incredible club now. It&rsquo;s something for their kids and grandkids to be proud of.&rdquo;<br>The former Liverpool manager hit out at critics of Scottish football who claim Celtic&rsquo;s run is down to the poor competition. The Hoops won the league by 30 points from Aberdeen, who set their own record tally.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unfair, because it&rsquo;s all relative,&rdquo; Rodgers said. &ldquo;I was at Chelsea when Chelsea beat Wigan 8-0 in the last game of the season to pick up a title. It&rsquo;s a brilliant league but they won 8-0, so what does that make the Premier League?<br>&ldquo;The only thing Celtic is missing is money. This is one of the great clubs in the world but it&rsquo;s not in a league where you have the finances. If Celtic had the finances of another league, this thing would just explode because of the sheer size of it.&rdquo;<br>Hearts were always likely to be a sideshow on a day of celebration at Celtic Park, which started with a large-scale display in tribute to the Lisbon Lions ahead of the 50th anniversary of their European Cup win.<br>The visitors frustrated Celtic until Griffiths&rsquo; 50th-minute opener and were far from disgraced, but the defeat rounded off a miserable second half to their campaign.<br>But Hearts head coach Ian Cathro remains unbroken himself after winning just once in 10 matches.<br>The 30-year-old said: &ldquo;My belief is even greater than it was in December. There was nothing that could happen that could knock the confidence and clarity I have in my work.<br>Cathro praised the &ldquo;focus&rdquo; and &ldquo;professionalism&rdquo; of Bjorn Johnsen, who retained his place despite reports of a dressing-room bust-up between the pair in midweek. <br>But when asked whether the striker would be at Tynecastle next season, Cathro said: &ldquo;Nobody is entirely in control of these things. The market sometimes dictates, but I was happy with his performance.&rdquo;<br><br><br><br><br>Brendan Rodgers hails Celtic&rsquo;s &lsquo;monumental achievement&rsquo;<br><br>Kieran Tierney, Brendan Rodgers and Scott Sinclair collected their Scottish Football Writers awards last night. Picture: Steve Welsh. <br>STEPHEN HALLIDAY<br>TheScotsman<br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers hailed his team for what he describes as the &ldquo;monumental achievement&rdquo; of completing a top-flight Scottish league season unbeaten and predicted it will never happen again in his lifetime.<br>The six-in-a-row Scottish champions wrapped up their Premiership campaign yesterday with a 2-0 win over Hearts at Celtic Park before receiving the trophy.<br>Celtic won 34 and drew four of their 38 matches, becoming the first team since Rangers won all 18 of their league fixtures in 1898-99 to go through a  season undefeated. On a day when Celtic also set a new club landmark of 106 points, Rodgers praised his players for securing a slice of footballing  immortality.<br>&ldquo;When you look at the past, when it was last done in the 1890s, it tells you the difficulty of achieving that,&rdquo; said the former Liverpool boss.<br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a monumental achievement by the players. What is lost among all the records set is the real dedication to excellence that they have shown since I&rsquo;ve come in, in their lives how they have worked hard every day.<br>&ldquo;They will probably tell you themselves that they get pushed really hard. But you see the benefits. It is a remarkable achievement for this football club and for the players who have inscribed their names into the history of his incredible club now. It&rsquo;s something for their kids and grandkids to be proud of. It is a special achievement.<br>&ldquo;I will probably look at it when I&rsquo;m long gone from here. The job is too big here to allow too much self-praise or self-reflection. We still have to continue. I&rsquo;m here to give as much to this club as I can. When you&rsquo;re gone, you&rsquo;ll get a true feeling of how people see you. But for now I&rsquo;m just so proud of the team and the staff because it&rsquo;s a real special achievement.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure it will happen again in my lifetime. You just need to look at when it was done before &ndash; in the 1890s and it was only an 18-game season. This is a 38-game season and with so many variables in football, that&rsquo;s what makes it a brilliant achievement.<br>&ldquo;Whether it will be done again, it&rsquo;s out there for everyone to have a go at. But we&rsquo;ll have a go at it again next year.&rdquo;<br>  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  BBC<br>by Andy Campbell<br><br>BBC Sport Scotland<br><br> From the section Football 314 <br><br>Highlights: Celtic 2-0 Hearts<br><br>Champions Celtic beat Hearts to become the first team to complete a Scottish top-flight season unbeaten for 118 years.<br><br>Leigh Griffiths and Stuart Armstrong secured a 34th win of the campaign for Brendan Rodgers&#39; side, who were then presented with the Premiership trophy.<br><br>The feat was last achieved by Rangers in 1898-99, over an 18-game season.<br><br>And Celtic join Arsenal (2003-04) and Juventus (2011-12) in being unbeaten over a 38-game league season.<br><br> Watch: Six key moments from Celtic&#39;s season<br> &#39;Mental strength in spades&#39; - Tom English on unbeaten triumph<br> Records tumble for Celtic&#39;s &#39;invincibles&#39;<br><br>Rodgers&#39; side, who won the League Cup in November, will attempt to win the club&#39;s first domestic treble since 2001 when they take on Aberdeen in Saturday&#39;s Scottish Cup final.<br>Celtic celebrate<br>Celtic received their second trophy of the season and another could follow at Hampden next week<br>Records tumble for new &#39;Invincibles&#39;<br><br>Celtic, who have won six top-flight titles in a row, are unbeaten in 46 domestic games this season (38 in league, eight in cups), and 47 domestic matches overall including the final league game of last season.<br><br>And they are unbeaten in 31 games in all competitions since losing to Barcelona in the Champions League on 23 November.<br><br>With the win and goals against Hearts, Celtic set new records for the Scottish Premier League/Premiership era, including goals, points, wins and margin of victory.<br>A graphic of Celtic&#39;s record this season<br>Professional and proficient<br><br>With so much anticipated from the hosts, Hearts head coach Ian Cathro sought to frustrate Celtic, restricting them to long-range efforts.<br><br>Kieran Tierney and Callum McGregor came closest with those and Griffiths sent a free-kick into the side netting.<br><br>And it could have been Hearts that went in front, Bjorn Johnsen laying a free-kick off for Alexandros Tziolis to strike narrowly over.<br>Leigh Griffiths scores<br>Griffiths took his personal tally of goals to 18 for the season<br><br>When Celtic did get into the box, goalkeeper Viktor Noring was in fine form.<br><br>The Swedish stopper made an instinctive block to deny Dedryck Boyata at a corner and then punched away Patrick Roberts&#39; dangerous cut-back.<br><br>However, Hearts&#39; resistance was broken when Roberts danced clear on the right and set up Griffiths for a confident header.<br><br>And Griffiths was involved in the second, his cross not properly cleared and falling for Armstrong to finish.<br>Hearts restore some pride<br><br>Though sustaining a fourth straight defeat, Hearts competed well in Glasgow and fared much better than their 5-0 home loss to Celtic last month - the match that clinched the title for Rodgers&#39; men.<br><br>Johnsen headed against the right-hand post from a Malaury Martin corner as Cathro&#39;s men sought consolation.<br><br>And substitute Martin&#39;s volley was then kept out by Craig Gordon late on.<br><br>Match ends, Celtic 2, Heart of Midlothian 0.<br>Full Time<br>Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39;<br><br>Second Half ends, Celtic 2, Heart of Midlothian 0.<br>Posted at 90&#39;<br><br>Tomas Rogic (Celtic) wins a free kick in the attacking half.<br>Posted at 90&#39;<br><br>Foul by Jamie Walker (Heart of Midlothian).<br>Posted at 88&#39;<br><br>(Celtic) wins a free kick in the attacking half.<br>Posted at 88&#39;<br><br>Foul by Don Cowie (Heart of Midlothian).<br>Posted at 88&#39;<br><br>Corner, Heart of Midlothian.

It&rsquo;s a monumental achievement by the players and what gets lost in amongst all the records and everything is a real dedication to excellence which they have shown since I came in, in their life and how they have worked hard every day. <br><br>&ldquo;They will probably tell you themselves that they get pushed very hard but hopefully they see the benefits. It&rsquo;s a remarkable achievement for the football club and this group of players, and they will inscribe their names into the history of this incredible club. It&rsquo;s something for their kids and their grandkids to be proud of.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special achievement. We had to come in and win the game and work well and to obviously beat the goals record and beat the wins records means it&rsquo;s a truly fantastic day.&rdquo;<br><br>There were joyous celebrations on the pitch after the whistle sounded on the final league fixture of the season and the Bhoys finally got their hands on the Scottish Premiership trophy, having clinched the league title at the start of April.<br><br>The Hoops boss said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite heavy! It&rsquo;s a great feeling for everyone. It brings an end to a league campaign which has been very tough.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes, being down in England, you look up and you see teams playing each other three, four, five and six times. but what it brings is an opportunity to look at the game differently tactically, and today again we played against a different system and a different way of working, and we had to find a way to come through that. The players did that, particularly in the second half, when I thought they were fantastic.<br><br>&ldquo;I am really pleased for the board and their choice when they asked me to come in,&rdquo; continued the Irishman. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted for the players and clearly delighted for the supportersm as being a Celtic supporter is all about the feeling and they should be having a nice feeling just now.&rdquo;<br><br>And the champions could still achieve more history next week when they take on Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden with a domestic treble at stake.<br><br>&ldquo;I think about the next game and that has been the key to our season this year,&rdquo; said the manager. We have never got too carried away as we were trying to forecast we would have in two, three or four games time. We now have a good week to recover. We will celebrate this success as this is important and then we will get ready for that and look forward to that game which will be a fantastic game at Hampden.&rdquo;<br><br>Record-breaking Celts dispatch Hearts in Paradise to become Invincibles<br><br>By: Mark Henderson on 21 May, 2017 14:41<br>http://www.celticfc.net/news/12664<br>Scottish Premiership<br>Celtic Park, Glasgow<br>Sunday, May 21, 2017<br><br>CELTIC...2<br>(Griffiths 50, Armstrong 76)<br><br>HEARTS...0<br><br>SECOND-HALF goals from Leigh Griffiths and Stuart Armstrong saw Celtic dispatch Hearts and make history by going the full league season undefeated on the day the six-in-a-row champions were presented with the Scottish Premiership trophy. <br><br>It was the Hoops&rsquo; 34th victory from 38 matches, and they finished the campaign with 106 points and 106 goals &ndash; all new records in a sensational first season under Brendan Rodgers.<br><br>&lsquo;The Invincibles&rsquo; had to wait until the second half to find a way through a defensive Hearts side, with Griffiths opening the scoring when he headed home a cross from the impressive Patrick Roberts.<br><br>As the game entered its closing stages, Stuart Armstrong secured the win and Celtic&rsquo;s place in the record books with close-range finish to get the party started in earnest in preparation for the trophy presentation.<br><br>And there could be further silverware on the horizon for the Bhoys, who are now undefeated in 46 matches since the start of the season, to celebrate as they aim to complete the treble in next weeks&rsquo; Scottish Cup final against Aberdeen. <br><br>Brendan Rodgers had made four changes to the Celtic team that brushed aside Patrick Thistle 5-0 on Thursday night in the penultimate match of the season. Jozo Simunovic, Kieran Tierney, Stuart Armstrong and Scott Sinclair all came back into the side, with Erik Sviatchenko, Emilio Izaguirre, Tom Rogic and James Forrest dropping out.<br><br>The champions walked out to a stunning stadium-wide tribute to the Lisbon Lions four on the 50th anniversary of their fairytale European Cup triumph. That simply added to the raucous atmosphere inside the ground which was packed to the gunnels by supporters hoping to see their side create another piece of history. <br><br>Against a Hearts team intent on protecting their goal, deploying every man behind the ball, the Hoops found it tough to fashion chances in the opening exchanges, and it took until the 15th minute for Leigh Griffiths to register the first shot on goal when the striker lashed a free-kick into the side-netting.<br><br>Tierney was next to try his luck, sending a rasping 30-yard drive inches over, before Armstrong was off target was distance.<br><br>Callum McGregor finally forced former Celt Viktor Noring into action in the 24th minute after a lovely turn but his shot was straight at the Swedish shot-stopper.<br><br>Content to line up outside their own box, the visitors did got their first meaningful sight of goal from a set-piece, with Alexandros Tzolis firing over from 20 yards.<br><br>Patrick Roberts, who had been in sensational form, was doing his utmost to unlock the Hearts rearguard but, after twisting and turning away from several challenges, he couldn&rsquo;t steer his shot on target. <br><br>Just after the hour-mark, the Bhoys started to crank up the pressure. From Griffiths&rsquo; corner, Boyata found himself in space but his volley was blocked at point-blank range by Noring.<br><br>Roberts then left the Hearts backline in spin with mazy run to the byline. Pinball ensued as the capital side struggled to clear his cutback, with Armstrong having a penalty claim turned down when his shot struck an arm. <br><br>The hosts continued the offensive but the breakthrough remained elusive as McGregor curled over after being picked out by Sinclair, before Griffiths looped a header over from Tierney&rsquo;s cross.<br><br>At the other end, another free-kick gave Bjorn Johnsen the opportunity to test Craig Gordon, the striker curling wide.<br><br>Brendan Rodgers sent on Tom Rogic for Cristian Gamboa at the start of the second half to add invention to the Hoops attack, and it quickly paid dividends as Celtic broke the deadlock.<br><br>Roberts, now operating as a right wing-back engineered some space before delivering a pinpoint cross for Griffiths, whose downward header left Noring with no chance.<br><br>The same combination almost saw the hit-man grab a quick-fire double. Fastening onto Roberts&rsquo; lofted pass, Griffiths did well to bring the ball down but this time the angle was too acute to find the net.<br><br>Celtic were now beginning to find their normal rhythm and fluency and Brown saw a shot blocked by Noring after the ball had ricocheted around the Hearts area, with Armstrong also having another penalty appeal waved away after going to ground in the box. <br><br>Roberts was now in full flow, and another sublime piece of skill from the English youngster had the home crowd on their feet as he danced along the byline and sent across a dangerous delivery that had no takers. The 20-year-old, making his final home appearance of an 18-month loan spell from Manchester City, then wasn&rsquo;t far away from distance.<br><br>A low shot from Johnsen briefly brought an end to the one-traffic, before Armstrong dragged an effort wide from the edge of the box &ndash; but the midfielder wasn&rsquo;t to be denied as sealed the victory with 14 minutes left.<br><br>Griffiths was the architect, speeding down the right and when he delivered a low ball into the mix, Armstrong&rsquo;s desire saw him win the ball and then steer a shot beyond Noring. <br><br>As the clock ticked down, Hearts had a flurry of chances as they committed men forward, with Johnsen hitting the bar with a header, Kolo Toure blocking a shot and Gordon making a smart save from Malauray Martin.<br><br>And once the final whistle sounded, it was time for Scott Brown to lift the silverware and for the manager, his backroom team and the players to take the acclaim of 60,000 euphoric supporters on a memorable day in Paradise.<br><br>CELTIC (4-2-3-1) Gordon; Gamboa (Rogic 46), Simunovic (Toure 74), Boyata, Tierney; Brown, Armstrong (Sviatchenko 78); Roberts, McGregor, Sinclair; Griffiths<br>Not Used: De Vries, Toure, Forrest, Kouassi<br><br>HEARTS (5-4-1) Noring; Brandon, Nowak, Bauben (Walker 65), Hughes, Smith; Cowie, Tzoli (Henderson 78), Djoum, Gonvcalves (Martin 55); Johnsen<br>Not Used: Hamilton, Kitchen, Avionitis, Choulay<br><br>Website Man of the Match: Patrick Roberts<span class="diffRemove">  </span></div>
