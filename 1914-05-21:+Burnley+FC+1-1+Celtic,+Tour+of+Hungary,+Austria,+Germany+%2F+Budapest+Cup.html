Describing it, The Glasgow Herald match report of May 22 simply states:- &quot;Celtic, 1; Burnley, 1. At Budapest. The game was very rough, and exciting scenes took place at the finish. The competition cup was withheld.&quot; [<b>24 words</b> from Glasgow&#39;s main newspaper for a local team whereas the Burnley Express, below gave a comprehensive report and summary totalling <b>782</b> words, 27th May and <b>1,298</b> words 30th May]</li><li>It was arranged that Celtic and Burnley would clash at the FTC Stadion,  home of Ferencvaros, for the prize of a handsome silver cup &ndash; in the  shape of a lighthouse &ndash; donated by local newspaper the Hungarian News.  The hosts had failed to mention this game to Celtic, but once in the city  the club altered its tour schedule to take part.</li><li>  Ironically this match was dubbed a <a href="/page/Battle+of+Britain" target="_self">&#39;Battle of Britain</a>&#39;, and then Great Britain &amp; Ireland were at war with Austria, Germany &amp; Hungary only a short time later. May 21st was a hot day in Budapest and the two sides met on a dry and bumpy pitch before a crowd of around 10,000.<br> The match was a hard and ill tempered contest. Jimmy McMenemy put Celtic in front through a 20th minute penalty. Burnley equalised from the penalty mark in the second half when Sunny Jim Young handled. Contemporary reports suggest that Celtic declined to play extra time. They agreed to travel to Burnley at a later date for a replay and the Hungarians were to forward the trophy.  </li><li>Ulster crisis: A Liberal Party candidate, Herbert Holman, speaking in Abbotswell, Devon, claimed the government had been less inactive than appeared in the Ulster gun-running. He revealed that the owner of the ship, Innismurray, was the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Clements,_5th_Earl_of_Leitrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Earl of Leitrim</a> who faced a bill of &pound;8,000, as he was the charterer of the confiscated ship. No doubt Sir Edward Carson would pay from the &pound;1 million Sterling fund he boasts of having said Mr Holman.   </li><li>  <a class="external" href="http://www.saveourglen.com/WPC-edit-content/uploads/2014/05/Scottish-Home-Rule-page0001.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Scottish Home Rule</a>, the Glasgow Herald opines: &ldquo;Remains where it has been for years, in the dreamland of academic interests.&rdquo;   </li><li>See also: <a href="/page/Budapest+Cup" target="_self">Budapest Cup</a></li><li>See also: <a class="external" href="http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/centenary-of-historic-celtic-match-210514-1566831.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Burnley FC anniversary tribute.</a><br></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Review<img align="right" alt="1914-05-21 Burnley 1 1 Celtic Tour of Hungary, Austria, Germany Pic" height="394" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/2WIhhVPGMIGjb_JrCanVJA140114/GW315H394" title="1914-05-21 Burnley 1 1 Celtic Tour of Hungary, Austria, Germany Pic" width="315"></h3>  Notes on the game (Burnley Express)<br><br>The result was a fair representation of the game, the Celtic had the best of the first half and Burnley the second. Both sides did better with the conditions, the ball was very lively and beat the man often on the hard ground. Celtic had the better ball control, their passing being<br>clean and crisp. Summed up their play was good and the side possessed brilliance. I don&rsquo;t think, on the whole, there was a lot of difference in the two sides given equal conditions.<br><br>Dawson gave a grand display in goal, some of his saves being great. He had a lot more to do than Shaw. I thought McGregor was the best of four good backs. Taylor again spoilt a good display by playing with the ball. However he looked after a strong wing well. Bamford was strong in his kicking and his tackling was good. All three halves were good, Watson being the best with Boyle and Halley playing their usual game.<br><br>Feeding was difficult owing to the high wind. The forward line was much better than in the first match. Nesbitt was prominent and his centring was high class. Lindley worked hard and this wing was the strongest on the field. Freeman played with energy and opened the game out. He often caused trouble with his well-known dashes and came near scoring on many occasions. Hodgson was clever in all his movements and barring a poor first half Grice was fair. Still the attack lacked sting.<br><br>Our men were willing to play extra time but the Celtic players would not agree to do so. After the match both teams received medals but the cup was withheld. Eventually it was tossed for and Burnley won but I think a match will be played in Burnley or Scotland for it and the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; shared.<br>As regards Grice, Burnley&rsquo;s new left winger, it must be said he has been unfortunate. In the first game he sustained an ankle injury which made him lame and in the circumstances one cannot judge him fairly. In that match he gave a very fair display, his centres being perfect. He can improve all the same, he is useful, if not brilliant.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><b>BURNLEY:</b><br><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Dawson_%28footballer_born_1888%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dawson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bamford" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bamford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Taylor_%28footballer_born_1883%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Taylor</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Halley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Halley</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Boyle_%28footballer_born_1886%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boyle</a>, <a class="external" href="http://www.claretsmuseum.com/wallwatson.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Watson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Nesbitt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nesbitt</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Lindley" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lindley</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Freeman" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Freeman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Hodgson" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hodgson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Grice" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Grice</a>. <br><b>Scorer:<br></b>Boyle<b><br></b><br><b>CELTIC:</b><br><a href="/page/Shaw%2C+Charlie" target="_self">Shaw</a>, <a href="/page/McGregor%2C+Thomas" target="_self">McGregor</a>, <a href="/page/Dodds%2C+Joe" target="_self">Dodds</a>, <a href="/page/Young%2C+James+%27Sunny+Jim%27" target="_self">Young</a>, <a href="/page/Johnstone%2C+Peter" target="_self">Johnstone</a>, <a href="/page/McMaster%2C+John" target="_self">McMaster</a>, <a href="/page/McAtee%2C+Andy" target="_self">McAtee</a>, <a href="/page/Gallacher%2C+Patsy" target="_self">Gallacher</a>, <a href="/page/McColl%2C+Jimmy" target="_self">McColl</a>, <a href="/page/McMenemy%2C+Jimmy" target="_self">McMenemy</a>, <a href="/page/Browning%2C+John" target="_self">Browning</a><br><b>Scorer:</b><br>McMenemy<br><b><br>Referee</b>: <br><b>Attendance</b>: 18,000<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles </h3>  <ul><li class="MsoNormal">  Match Report (see end of page below)<br></li></ul>  <h3>  Pictures </h3>  <ul><li class="MsoNormal">  <a href="/page/1914-05-21+Burnley+1+1+Celtic+Tour+of+Hungary%2C+Austria%2C+Germany+Pictures" target="_self">Match Pictures</a></li></ul><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><ul><li class="MsoNormal">Celtic Wiki are grateful to Ray Simpson club archivist of Burnley Football Club for his and the club&#39;s help in providing Burnley Express article from their archives, and Tobak Csaba of Ferencvaros for Match Pictures. see <a class="external" href="http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/centenary-of-historic-celtic-match-210514-1566831.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><b>Burnley 1-1 Celtic at the Ferencvaros Ground, Thursday 21 May 1914</b><br><br>BURNLEY EXPRESS 27 MAY 1914<br><br>EVEN BUT ROUGH GAME, ANOTHER TROPHY COMING TO BURNLEY<br><br>The meeting of Burnley and Glasgow Celtic took place at the FTC ground in Budapest on Thursday before 18,000 spectators in summerlike weather. Prior to the match a programme of sports was carried out.<br><br>Burnley team: Dawson, Bamford, Taylor, Halley, Boyle, Watson, Nesbitt, Lindley, Freeman, Hodgson, Grice. Celtic had their full Cup team except McGregor deputised for McNair at right back. Mr J. Haworth (Burnley Secretary/manager) acted as one linesman and Mr W. Maley of the Celtic club was the other.<br><br>The game lost practically all chance of being a friendly one because the Hungarian News virtually turned it into another Cup contest by presenting a handsome cup and two sets of medals. The cup was of a fine design and valued at &pound;65. It represented a lighthouse. Both teams and officials were photographed before the match and there was an army of photographers taking photographs on their own account.<br><br>The Celtic won the toss and had the wind and sun at their backs. The ground was hard and devoid of grass. Play began in earnest, both teams being keen, and once they settled down they gave a good exhibition which was appreciated. When play had been in progress 20 minutes Taylor brought down McMenemy in the penalty area and from the (penalty) kick a goal was scored by McMenemy. The referee was a Hungarian and he showed a good idea of the game, his decisions generally giving satisfaction. <br>At half-time Celtic led 1-0.<br><br>In the second half the wind moderated but Burnley had got into their stride and were going fine. They seemed to be the favourites. In this half a lot of feeling was introduced and fouls were frequent. Taylor was out twice with ankle taps. Watson got a thigh injury, Nesbitt got his knees injured twice and gravel rash on the elbows and hips. Boyle was deliberately kicked on the shin and Grice got injured in a collision with Mercer. This gave Mr Edwards, the Burnley trainer, plenty of work. The stoppages for injuries to Celtic players were not so <br>frequent.<br><br>It was more of a cup tie than a friendly and the pace was a revelation, considering the weather. It surprised most folk. Burnley equalised, also from a penalty for handling, Boyle scoring. <br><br>The match ended in a draw of 1-1.  <br><br><br>  <b>BURNLEY EXPRESS</b> 30 MAY 1914<br><br>CUP CONTEST WITH CELTIC, SEEN THROUGH GLASGOW GLASSES<br><br>The Celtic were accompanied by the &ldquo;Glasgow Evening Times&rdquo; reporter who writes:<br><br>Lest international and club rivalry would not suffice to induce the teams to do themselves justice in a friendly match, the astute Hungarians converted the friendly fixture into a cup-tie by putting up a trophy and badges, the former to go to the winning team and every player of the 22 to get a medal.<br><br>Burnley had agreed with the Hungarian secretary to play Celtic and the fixture appeared on their programme, but the Glasgow club knew nothing of this arrangement until they reached Vienna. It was one thing to play any native team, but a very different matter to take on the English Cup-holders, and probably spoil the forthcoming meeting of the rival champions at Parkhead next season. However when the Celtic directors learned that the proceeds of the game were to be devoted to charity they fell in with the arrangement, stipulating that &pound;25 should be given to Scottish charities, and a larger sum if the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; exceeded a certain sum. <br><br>There was nothing the matter with the &ldquo;gate&rdquo; as the day was a church holiday and all shops, banks and warehouses were closed. The stands and reserve enclosures were packed as usual at five, three and two krones extra, and with over 20,000 paying 1 krone 20 fillers each on entrance, the charity fund must have been increased by close on &pound;1500. It did seem peculiar to see the English and Scottish Cup-holders step on to the Ferencvaros grounds, almost 2,000 miles from home to fight for one more cup, and the crowd settled down in expectation of witnessing a thrilling game. They saw one, of that there was no question.<br><br>How it all began no one could tell but there was no doubt whatever about the finish, which was more dramatic than even the hot blooded natives anticipated. Prior to the match the writer had talked the matter over with both teams and the one wish of all the players was to put up an interesting game without unduly distressing themselves or injuring each other. <br><br>The evening set in cool after the hottest day of the season and the breeze from the Danube became a strong gusty wind, very comforting to the lightly-dressed spectators, but a source of annoyance to the players, who found a light ball, a baked pitch innocent of grass and a fitful wind all against good football.<br><br>The Celts had the assistance of the wind first half and lost no time in proving to the impartial natives that when it came to close, delightful passing there was only one team in it. Perhaps it would be scarcely correct to talk of the spectators as unbiased, for Celtic wore the same colours, green and white, while Burnley, discarding the claret and blue, wore a vertical blue and white stripe, which happened to be the colours of the champion team of the city (MTK). It was a case of cheering the jerseys rather than the players, and Burnley did not know until after the match how it was that a large section of the crowd had espoused their cause.<br><br>With the wind at their backs the Celts took charge of the game and kept their opponents on the defence all the time, except for an occasional breakaway. But the Parkhead forwards seldom got the ball to their liking near Dawson. It either bounced high over their heads, or swerved or curled away from their feet when about to shoot. The result was that Dawson was not kept so busy as one would expect after so much pressure, but even then he was very fortunate to hear a tremendous drive from McAtee hit a post and produce a report like a bomb. Dawson had time to put up his hands when McColl drove in the best shot he has yet delivered as a senior. It was left to Gallagher to bring out the first goal and if he did not actually score, he was on the point of doing so when he was charged down from behind with the goal at his mercy. The penalty goal represented the damage done at half-time. Shaw never once handled a shot this half.<br><br>A different tale remains to be told of the second half of the game. It was now Burnley&rsquo;s turn to play with the wind, and they started off as if they meant to equalise right away, but the Turfites did not press as much as the Celts had during the initial stage. Twenty minutes of the second half had gone and Burnley were still a goal behind, when they were awarded a penalty and Boyle did not give Shaw any earthly chance with the penalty. This, the writer says, was the first shot that Shaw had to stop. Burnley having played desperately to draw level, now went out for the winning goal, if possible. Boyle&rsquo;s voice was heard all over the place, advising and encouraging his men but&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;any chance of Burnley scoring. The last 25 minutes were more fierce than any Cup final and the crowd yelled and cheered wildly and impartially as the ball was taken from end to end of the field. But there was not a sound when the game was stopped now and then and the trainer called in to give first aid. Once both trainers were on the field at the same time attending to their men. It is impossible to give a description of the last 15 minutes of this remarkable game where some of the players mistook each other for the ball and two came to blows.<br><br>It was a thrilling finish and no mistake. There stood both teams on the field arguing and shouting at each other, the cool heads on each side calling for peace and a replay some other time, the hotheads wanting the match settled there and then, and not too particular how the thing was done. Those of the crowd who had not rushed on the field were standing up yelling and cheering or stamping the planks of the stands and clapping their hands like so many madmen. The referee was jabbering away all the time and no one paid any attention to him, because no one understood him. The club directors had a stiff job getting the fighting section of each team to take a sane view of the affair and after another scene of angry recrimination, the players separated and retired to their dressing rooms, still hurling threats and imprecations at each other. The gentleman of the Burnley party was David Taylor, the best player on his side, the quietest when all was confusion at the finish. When the excitement had partly cooled down the club officials met and agreed to toss for the temporary possession of the cup, leaving the fixing of the replay at Burnley, Parkhead or neutral ground until the morrow.<br><br>Burnley won the toss and were then told that the donor of the cup, a local newspaper proprietor, would not allow the trophy to leave Budapest until one side or other had won it next season. The players were then handed the badges, all 22 receiving one, and the cup, still surrounded on the track by seven policemen, with swords, not drawn but very handy, was left behind. This cup, the cause of all the commotion, stands about two feet high, shaped like a miner&rsquo;s safety lamp or model lighthouse, and is studded with gems, which may never have seen Amsterdam. In an experience of over thirty years the writer has never witnessed such a scene of excitement as at the close of the contest for such a magnificent trophy.<br><br><b>Transcribed from Burnley Express</b><br><br><b>Ray Simpson</b><br><b>May 2014</b>  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Charlie Shaw&#39;s medal:<br><img align="bottom" alt="Budapest Cup - Pic" height="421" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/rhMl_UcshEOUqdywsYxX8g40790/GW718H421" title="Budapest Cup - Pic" width="718"></h3><h3>  Centenary of Historic Celtic Match</h3>http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/news/article/centenary-of-historic-celtic-match-210514-1566831.aspx<br>By Ray Simpson, Club Historian (Burnley)<br><br>09:45 21st May 2014<br>The dust has just about settled on a momentous period in Burnley FC history, promotion back to the top flight and the centenary celebrations of the Clarets&rsquo; famous FA Cup victory in 1914.<br><br>We now reflect on another centenary, that of a Burnley match played in the spring of 1914, just weeks before the continent of Europe was to be engulfed in a conflict that would change the course of history.<br><br>One hundred years ago today, 21 May 1914, Burnley were lining up for a prestigious friendly encounter with Glasgow Celtic at the Ulloi Uti Stadion in Budapest, the home of Ferencvaros. The game was to be the second match of Burnley FC&rsquo;s first-ever foreign tour, undertaken to Germany and what was then the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.<br><br>The Burnley players arrived in Budapest by overnight train from Berlin, having won the first tour match 2-1 against Berlin Viktoria, thanks to goals from Richard Lindley and Bert Freeman. It had been Burnley Football Club&rsquo;s first-ever match on foreign soil.<br><br>1914 Postcard Burnley v Berlin FC 17 May carousel<br>The Burnley and Berlin Viktoria players line up together before the first match of the tour. Burnley won 2-1 in what was the club&#39;s first-ever match on foreign soil<br><br>When the Burnley and Celtic players and officials arrived at the Ferencvaros ground they discovered that, far from their encounter being billed as a friendly, it had been turned into a Cup final, a battle between the English and Scottish Cup winners (Celtic were actually Scottish double winners). The local newspaper, the Hungarian News, had offered an impressive trophy, the Budapest Cup, for the winners. The Cup was almost two feet high and shaped like a lighthouse and it was studded with gems. <br>In addition all 22 players were to be presented with medals.<br><br>1914 Budapest Cup medal carousel<br>One of the medals awarded to all 22 players after the Budapest Cup match against Celtic. Bert Freeman&#39;s medal is currently on show in the 1914 exhibition at Towneley Hall, courtesy of Mr Derek Jenkins<br><br>The Burnley players were asked if they would turn out in blue and white striped shirts, while Celtic played in green shirts, although not their normal hoops but solid green with white trim. The shirts were all part of the plan by the hosts to make the game more competitive and to fully involve the crowd. Celtic wore the green of the Ferencvaros club while Burnley wore the blue of their deadly rivals MTK Budapest, who had actually succeeded the hosts as Hungarian Champions. As it happened there were plenty of MTK supporters in the crowd which engendered the required atmosphere.<br><br>The evening was cool after the hottest day of the year and the breeze from the Danube turned into a strong gusty wind. It was very comforting to the lightly-dressed spectators, but a source of annoyance to the players, who found a light ball, a baked, uneven pitch devoid of grass and an unpredictable wind all against good football.<br><br>Teams: <br>Burnley: Dawson, Bamford, Taylor, Halley, Boyle, Watson, Nesbitt, Lindley, Freeman, Hodgson Grice.<br>Celtic: Shaw, McGregor, Dodds, Youngs, Johnstone, McMaster, McAtee, Gallagher, McColl, McMenemy, Browning.<br><br>Celtic had made one change from their Cup-winning side, with right back McNair being replaced by McGregor. Burnley&rsquo;s team showed two changes from their Cup-winning side, goalkeeper Jerry Dawson was back, replacing Ronnie Sewell who had stepped into the breach when Dawson was unable to take part in the final because of injury. In addition, at outside left was Reuben Grice, the Clarets&rsquo; new signing from Midland League Champions Rotherham County. Grice had been added to the touring party when regular outside left Eddie Mosscrop, a schoolmaster, was refused permission to take part in the tour by his employers.<br><br>Celtic won the toss and in the first half played with the sun and the strong wind behind them and had the better of the opening exchanges. They used the ball better and found their men more accurately, although both teams earned appreciative applause from the Hungarian crowd. <br>After 20 minutes McMenemy was upended by David Taylor in the penalty area, the spot kick was taken by McMenemy himself and he drove the ball past Jerry Dawson into the Burnley net.<br><br>Half-time Burnley 0-1 Celtic<br><br>1914 tour booklet cover<br><br>After the restart it was Burnley&rsquo;s turn to play with the wind, and they began at a furious pace, apparently determined to get back on level terms as quickly as possible.<br>Midway through the second half Burnley were still a goal behind but then they were awarded a penalty for handball. Tommy Boyle stepped up and smashed the ball into the net, giving goalkeeper Shaw no chance whatever.<br>The Burnley players now knew they were on top and went all out for the winner. Skipper Tommy Boyle&rsquo;s voice could be heard all over the ground as he exhorted his men to more effort, but the Celtic team were just as equally determined to hold out.<br><br>The closing stages became more and more fiercely competitive and the crowd yelled and cheered wildly as the ball swung from end to end. Tackles became more and more reckless, players went in hard and not always fairly, and visits from the trainers became more and more frequent. Remarkably however there was complete silence from the crowd whenever the game was stopped for injured players to be treated.<br><br>Tempers continued to flare and as the Burnley Express reported:<br>&ldquo;It is impossible to give a description of the last 15 minutes of this remarkable game where some of the players mistook each other for the ball and two came to blows.<br>It was a thrilling finish and no mistake. There stood both teams on the field arguing and shouting at each other, the cool heads on each side calling for peace and a replay some other time, the hotheads wanting the match settled there and then, and not too particular how the thing was done.&rdquo; <br><br>Eventually things cooled down and, although Burnley wanted to play extra time, Celtic refused. The club officials put their heads together and agreed to arrange a replay, although the venue was yet to be decided. They also agreed to toss a coin for the right to keep the cup until the replay took place and Tommy Boyle called correctly. However this turned out to be rather academic as the newspaper proprietor who had provided the trophy refused to allow it to leave Hungary until the outcome of the &ldquo;Battle of the Cup winners&rdquo; had been decided. All the 22 players were then awarded medals for their participation in this historic fixture.<br><br>A replay was eventually arranged to decide once and for all the winners of the Budapest Cup. It took place three months after the &ldquo;battle of Budapest&rdquo; at Turf Moor on the first day of September 1914. By then of course war had been declared and football was not necessarily the top of everyone&rsquo;s list of priorities.<br><br>For the record Celtic deservedly won the match 2-1 in front of a Turf Moor crowd of 10,000, at last earning the right to hold aloft the Budapest Cup. The trouble was, there was no Cup, it had been raffled off at the outbreak of war to raise much-needed funds for the Hungarian Red Cross.<br><br>However, eventually there was a relatively happy ending to the Budapest Cup saga, at least for Celtic Football Club. In 1988, the year of Celtic&rsquo;s centenary, Ferencvaros sent a delegation to Glasgow to attend Celtic&rsquo;s Scottish Championship-winning match. After the game the Hungarian visitors presented Celtic with the &ldquo;Ferencvaros Vase&rdquo; an ornate porcelain vase produced to replace the trophy that Celtic had missed out on 74 years earlier.<br><br>Who said there was no sentiment in football?<br><br>Footnotes: <br><br>After the Celtic match both clubs continued their tours with Burnley playing two more matches in Budapest, beginning with a 1-3 defeat by Ferencvaros. Burnley&rsquo;s goal was scored by Richard Lindley, who had the misfortune to break his arm later in the game. Three days later Burnley beat a representative Hungarian amateur team 2-0, with goals from Bert Freeman and Billy Nesbitt. <br><br>The tourists then travelled to Vienna and played two games in two days at Rapid Vienna&rsquo;s stadium, with Rapid themselves beaten 3-1 thanks to goals from Freeman, Nesbitt and Bob Kelly. The final match of the tour was on the first day of June and a tiring Burnley team were beaten 3-0 by an Austrian Select Xl, made up of players from Rapid and two other clubs in Vienna.<br><br>Ferencvaros still play at the same venue, although the stadium has now been completely rebuilt and renamed the Florian Albert Stadion. <br><br>Florian Albert was one of Ferencvaros&rsquo; most famous players, who appeared in more than 350 games for the club, scoring over 250 goals, between 1958 and 1974. He won 75 international caps for Hungary, scoring 31 goals, and was European Footballer of the Year in 1967.<br><br>By Ray Simpson, Club Historian<br><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="1914-05-21" height="1024" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/4090bebee535897fa62c0db2958fb436/GW577H1024" title="1914-05-21" width="577"><div></div><div><img align="bottom" alt="1914-05-21: Burnley FC 1-1 Celtic, Tour of Hungary, Austria, Germany / Budapest Cup - The Celtic Wiki" height="436" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/61d18413bf11484123bf85b7bd12cb93/GW1075H436" title="1914-05-21: Burnley FC 1-1 Celtic, Tour of Hungary, Austria, Germany / Budapest Cup - The Celtic Wiki" width="1075"></div></div></div>
