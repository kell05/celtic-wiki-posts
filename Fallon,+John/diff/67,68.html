Fallon was taken on as a junior by Celtic, and soon was promoted to cover for the famously eccentric keeper <a href="/page/Haffey%2C+Frank" target="_self">Frank Haffey</a>. Fallon played his first full game for the Celtic first team in <a href="/page/1959" target="_self">1959</a> and replaced Haffey completely in <a href="/page/1963" target="_self">1963</a>. <br><br>However, in spite of a successful European campaign in 1964, he lost his place as first choice keeper to the more experienced <a href="/page/Simpson%2C+Ronnie" target="_self">Ronnie Simpson</a> after Jock Stein arrived as manager. He good-naturedly understudied Simpson for the next couple of years, playing only occasionally against &quot;<i>easy opponents</i>.&quot; When interviewed, he said that it was more nerve-racking sitting on the bench as substitute than it was being on the field.   <br><br>John&#39;s first Celtic success came in the Scottish Cup final of 1965 which Celtic won 3-2. A Celtic man through and through John was seen swinging wildly on the crossbar at the Kings Park (Celtic) end as he celebrated Billy McNeill&#39;s dramatic last minute winner, however he lost his place in the Autumn of 1965 when <a href="/page/Simpson%2C+Ronnie" target="_self">Ronnie Simpson</a> took over. Ronnie Simpson is regarded by many as possibly our greatest ever goalkeeper, so it was to be a difficult task to make his way back into the side ahead of Ronnie.<br><br>In the <a href="/page/Lisbon+Lions" target="_self">European Cup final</a> of <a href="/page/1967" target="_self">1967</a>, played in Lisbon, between Celtic and Inter Milan, Fallon, who, as goalkeeper, was the only substitute allowed at the time, and sat out the entire match. He is thus the only Lisbon Lions player not to have actually played. Some people unfairly, leave him out of the Lisbon Lions entirely but this is partly as in those days there were no substitutions in matches except for injuries so substitutes weren&#39;t regarded in the same way as they are now, but also as he actually only played in one single match the whole season (a 2-0 win over Kilmarnock in May 1967). <br><br>John Fallon did play one small part for the Lisbon Lions. As the substitute at Lisbon, he was famously sent out early to claim the bench nearest the half-way line as a shrewd psychological move by Jock Stein to show Inter Milan that this Celtic team were defiant and not going to be bullied by anyone. &quot;<i>We Shall Not Be Moved</i>&quot;! Indeed.<br><br>Disgracefully, chairman Sir Robert Kelly ordered Jock Stein to take back the European Cup medal from John Fallon as he did not play in the final. Bit outrageous as John Fallon was in the squadffor the final and so should have had the courtesy to be awarded a medal. In fairness to Bob Kelly, it can be argued that actually John Fallon had not played once for Celtic that season in the European Cup run and only once for the first team domestically, so receiving a European Cup medal would be excessive for just being the required goalkeeping substitute on the day. In any case, having been handed the medal it should never have been taken back. If it was an error to hand him a medal in the first place, then that is where the control should be reviewed, and not in actions against John Fallon. However, he was to receive an official replica medal later that year as Celtic requested additional medals, and in April 2019 he had the original medal returned to him. So much respect to the later board for this. <br><br>Despite the deputy role in Lisbon, John Fallon went on to have the privilege of playing in the great Alfredo Di Stefano&#39;s testimonial match in Celtic&#39;s famous 1-0 win and had a marvellous game in the Bernabeau in June 1967. <br><br>After the European triumph, Celtic reached the final of the World Club Cup the same year. They were in a two-leg final against Racing Club of Argentina. While warming up for the second leg, a brick (Sir Robert Kelly says it was a &quot;<i>flat iron bar</i>&quot;) thrown or catapulted by a member of the crowd, struck Simpson on the head. With Simpson unable to play as a result, Fallon was called on to keep goal in a bad-tempered second leg, and an even more bad-tempered replay. <br><br>Although Celtic lost the return leg, and the subsequent play-off in Uruguay, amid accusations of extreme foul play from the Racing players (an accusation later backed by UEFA), Fallon distinguished himself with a string of saves which caused one commentator to remark: &quot;<i>If that&#39;s the reserve keeper, what must the other guy be like?</i>&quot; <br><br>Back to domestic matches, on January 2nd 1968, John Fallon had a bad experience against Rangers at Parkhead when he lost two soft goals and received a lot of criticism following the 2-2 draw. However, he showed great strength of character by not letting it affect him later on and Celtic won the title again despite that result.<br><br>After Simpson received a shoulder injury in 1968, John took his place and duly picked up League Cup and Scottish Cup winners medals, against Hibs and Rangers respectively, both in April 1969. In the Rangers final he had a notable performance and this helped to heal the wounds of 1968. At one point he made a fine save and turned round to the Celtic fans behind him to give them the thumbs up to which the fans cheered loudly. In this game he received a lot of heavy challenges from Rangers players who tried to unsettle him but showed immense restraint. He also had a fine game in the San Siro as Celtic gained a fine 0-0 draw against AC Milan in March 1969. <br><br>According to Sir Robert Kelly in his book <i>Celtic</i>, when Celtic tried to get the second leg declared void because of the Simpson incident, Racing Club used John Fallon&#39;s heroic performance as their counter argument, and the result stood. Baffling as what else was Fallon meant to do in the match?<br><br>After Simpson&#39;s retirement, Fallon was the number one Celtic keeper and he won another League Cup medal in the 1-0 win over St. Johnstone at Hampden in the final of October 1969. However after Evan Williams joined from Wolves John lost his place although he did play four games in Celtic&#39;s march to the 1970 European Cup final in Milan. He played his last game for Celtic on 12th December 1970 and he moved to <a href="/page/Motherwell" target="_self">Motherwell</a> in 1972, then moving on to Greenock Morton and retiring from active play shortly after. <br><br>Fallon never played for Scotland, so in retrospectives isn&#39;t often ranked amongst the nation&#39;s greatest keepers, but he is to date the only Scottish keeper to have played in two World Club Cup final matches, so deserves a greater hearing.<br><br></font><div><font color="#333333">John Fallon was a Celtic man through and through who gave his all during his time at Parkhead and was appreciated greatly by the Celtic fans of that era. He can still be seen at Parkhead following his beloved Celtic, and has contributed to Celtic articles &amp; documentaries highlighting injustices against the club &amp; support during his time as a player. <br></font></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career<br></h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1958-72</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  114</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  14</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  36</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  20</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  184</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Shut-outs:</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  32</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  6</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  13</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  10</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  61<br>(33%)</td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <div align="center">  </div>  <h3>  Honours with Celtic</h3><div><div><b>Scottish League</b></div><div><ul><li><font color="#333333"><a href="/page/1966" target="_self"><font size="2">1965-66</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1967" target="_self"><font size="2">1966-67</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1968" target="_self"><font size="2">1967-68</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1969" target="_self"><font size="2">1968-69</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1970" target="_self"><font size="2">1969-70</font></a><font size="2">,</font></font></li><li><font color="#333333"><a href="/page/1971" target="_self"><font size="2">1970-71</font></a></font></li></ul></div><div><b>Scottish Cup</b></div><div><ul><li><font size="2"> <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1964-65" target="_self">1965</a>, <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1968-69" target="_self">1969</a></font></li></ul></div><div><b>Scottish League Cup</b></div><ul><li><font color="#333333"><a href="/page/1966" target="_self"><font size="2">1965-66</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1968" target="_self"><font size="2">1967-68</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1969" target="_self"><font size="2">1968-69</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1970" target="_self"><font size="2">1969-70</font></a><font size="2">, </font><a href="/page/1971" target="_self"><font size="2">1970-71</font></a></font></li></ul>      </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Fallon%2C+John+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><div><h3><span class="diffAdd">Articles</span></h3></div><div><ul><li><a href="/page/Fallon%2C+John+-+Miscellaneous+Articles" target="_self"><span class="diffAdd">Miscellaneous Articles</span></a><br></li></ul></div><h3>Books</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Books+-+John+Fallon%3A+Keeping+in+Paradise+%282015%29" target="_self">Biog: John Fallon : Keeping in Paradise (2015) by Fallon with David Potter</a><br></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Quotes &amp;

This is John Fallon, once the red-haired idol of the Celtic fans, but now in genteel retirement, and doing what he loves the most - watching his beloved Celtic.</span><span class="diffRemove">John cannot have missed many games over the years since he retired, and he has been spotted at venues like Love Street, Easter Road, Brockville and Rugby Park when Celtic are supplying the opposition.</span><span class="diffRemove">John Fallon was born in Blantyre (where he still lives) round about the time of The Battle of Britain in 1940, and 18 years later joined the only team that he was ever likely to want to play for - Glasgow Celtic.</span><span class="diffRemove">His debut came against Clyde in September 1959, and in one of his early games at Arbroath, he was seen to make a save and then turn to the punters behind the goal and give them the &quot;thumbs-up&quot; sign. This horrified the traditionalists, but showed the Celtic fans that he was one of us.</span><span class="diffRemove">For a while he was the understudy to the eccentric Frank Haffey of Wembley infamy. Frank was a good goalkeeper, although capable of many &quot;howlers&quot;. John kept working away waiting for his time to come. It duly did as things began to pick up in November 1963, and Fallon had a good second half in that season. Nothing was won, but there was a good run in Europe, and on one occasion at Greenock in January 1964, Fallon turned round to his fans with arms aloft to show his appreciation of a good goal scored at the other end. An over-zealous policeman then told him to stop doing that, for it might incite the fans!</span><span class="diffRemove">For Fallon, the relationship with the Celtic fans was crucial. In a very special sense, they were Celtic. Fallon would make the utmost effort to talk to the snotty-nosed youngsters whom the Welfare State had not quite reached in 1964. He would be seen talking to the ballboys, even at away grounds, and on one train journey to Aberdeen, came out of the compartment specially to talk to the fans when the other members of the team gave the impression that green and white supporters&#39; scarves got in the way. On that occasion, when the train stopped at Stonehaven, a couple of youngsters in the red and white of Aberdeen got on, and they too were talked to by this unassuming young man whom they clearly did not believe to be Celtic&#39;s goalkeeper!</span><span class="diffRemove">The arrival of Stein in 1965 was preceded by that of Ronnie Simpson, a veteran of the Olympic Games of 1948, and two English Cup Finals with Newcastle United in 1952 and 1955. Yet Stein did not seem to like Simpson, and in Stein&#39;s first Scottish Cup triumph, that glorious day of deliverance in April 1965, it was Fallon who was in Celtic&#39;s goal. He saved the day on more than one occasion, when the Pars pressed hard, he swung on the crossbar at the final whistle, then rushed off to hospital to be with his wife Essie as she gave birth the following day.</span><span class="diffRemove">There was little wrong with Fallon or Celtic&#39;s world in spring 1965.</span><span class="diffRemove">But John had a bad day (in the eyes of Stein at least) in a game at Ibrox in September 1965 and Simpson was now given the nod. Many a lesser man would have taken the huff, handed in a transfer request and thrown the toys out of the pram. Not a bit of it with this man. He became friends with Ronnie Simpson, made a point of sitting beside him on the team bus and learning all that he could from this luminary of the game.</span><span class="diffRemove">John Fallon was thus a spectator at Lisbon, but still counts it as one of the greatest games of his life. Pictures clearly show him jumping off the bench at the final whistle and rushing to congratulate Ronnie.</span><span class="diffRemove">He was called upon at short notice to play in the World Club Cup Final in Argentina in November 1967 when Ronnie Simpson was struck with a missile. It was something that needed a great deal of courage, but John let no-one down.</span><span class="diffRemove">Everyone recalls the dreadful John Fallon moment of January 1968. Ronnie had pulled out through injury, and John played at Parkhead against Rangers. His followers looked on in dismay as he made two errors to give Rangers an undeserved draw.</span><span class="diffRemove">Yet everyone identified with him several months later when Celtic wrested back the initiative in the Championship race. He was playing at a deserted Parkhead against Raith Rovers Reserves. He neither knew nor cared what the score was, but he did know that the first team were winning the Glasgow Cup at Hampden that night, and that Morton had drawn with Rangers in the Scottish League. Celtic duly won the Championship, and 1968 would not be known as &quot;Fallon&#39;s folly&quot;.</span><span class="diffRemove">But 1969 was his &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. An injury in February more or less ended Simpson&#39;s career, and thus Fallon was involved in that glorious month of April when Celtic won all three domestic trophies. The sweetest was the 4-0 beating of Rangers in the Scottish Cup Final, when John survived some dreadful treatment from some thuggish Rangers forwards and saved everything that came his way.</span><span class="diffRemove">Just to put a little icing on the glorious Treble cake that was 1969, Fallon then played in the League Cup Final of that year, saving brilliantly twice from Benny Rooney of St. Johnstone to win another medal.</span><span class="diffRemove">It was often said that Stein could not judge a goalkeeper. He certainly did not keep one for long, and by the end of that season, John had lost out to Evan Williams, a competent but by no means brilliant keeper.</span><span class="diffRemove">John thus missed out on the European Cup Final in 1970, and although he hung around until 1972, it was obvious that he was permanently out of favour. He moved to Motherwell and later Morton, but his heart remained where it still is to be found on match days, at Parkhead.</span><span class="diffRemove">If you see John Fallon, go up and talk to him! He is surely what Celtic Football Club is meant to be about!</span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">John Fallon - (TheSun interview)</span><span class="diffRemove">JOHN FALLON has no problem recognising Jock Stein&rsquo;s remarkable achievements as Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever manager.</span><span class="diffRemove">But  one of the most decorated keepers in the Hoops&rsquo; 127-year history will  never forgive Stein for how he treated him at Parkhead.</span><span class="diffRemove">Fallon&rsquo;s autobiography &lsquo;Keeping in Paradise&rsquo; was launched yesterday in, ironically, the Jock Stein Lounge at Celtic Park.</span><span class="diffRemove">On  the front cover there&rsquo;s even a praiseworthy quote from the legendary  manager stating &lsquo;John Fallon is an outstanding example . . . we can be  proud of him&rsquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">Fallon, though, told SunSport those words were  never voiced to him by Stein &mdash; a man he scathingly describes in the book  as being &lsquo;duplicitous&rsquo; and &lsquo;manipulative&rsquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">Back-up to Ronnie  Simpson for the 1967 European Cup triumph, he has harboured bitterness  towards one of the club&rsquo;s most revered figures for 50 YEARS.</span><span class="diffRemove">In his eyes, the late Stein was a football genius &mdash; but appalling with man-management.</span><span class="diffRemove">Fallon&rsquo;s  hard-hitting book published today doesn&rsquo;t miss the giant who famously  became Hoops boss in 1965 and transformed an ailing team into the best  in Europe and virtually unbeatable in Scotland, winning nine successive  titles and 13 cups.</span><span class="diffRemove">At the heart of it all was Fallon.</span><span class="diffRemove">He was overshadowed by Simpson, yet still featured in some of the club&rsquo;s most momentous games.</span><span class="diffRemove">Celtic&rsquo;s  first ever Euro tie against Valencia in 1962, the 1965 Scottish Cup  Final triumph over Dunfermline, the infamous 1967 away World Club  Championship matches against Racing Club, the victory over Real Madrid  in Alfredo di Stefano&rsquo;s testimonial, the 4-0 thrashing of Rangers in the  1969 Scottish Cup Final.</span><span class="diffRemove">Fallon played 184 times for Celtic and kept 61 shutouts. However, he didn&rsquo;t ever feel Stein believed in him.</span><span class="diffRemove">The 75-year-old said: &ldquo;I still feel bitterly disappointed by Stein. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever be able to forgive him.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I respect everything he did in football. But his man- management? It was dreadful.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;In my early days as a junior he tried to move me on and I refused to go. I think he held it against me.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I played in a lot of big games, but I don&rsquo;t think he ever believed in me.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I reckon he only played me because he had to.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I  played exceptionally well in di Stefano&rsquo;s testimonial. But after the  game all Stein could say to me was &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re getting f******  paid for&rsquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;Stein stopped me from playing for Scotland and Republic of Ireland. I&rsquo;m sure of that.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;A  well-known journalist from that era, James Sanderson &mdash; someone who was  well connected and close to Stein &mdash; told me a few years after I left the  club that he hadn&rsquo;t wanted me involved at international level.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I  felt sick. It was bad enough him making sure that I missed out for  Scotland, but he did the same with Ireland who I qualified for through  my grandfather. I only spoke to Stein once in the 13 years between me  leaving Celtic in 1972 and his passing in 1985.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;He actually BANNED me from Parkhead, or at least from going through the front door.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;After  I left Celtic I went up to the entrance for a night game against Inter  Milan. The doorman stopped me and said bluntly I wasn&rsquo;t welcome, that he  was acting on orders.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;It must have come from Stein.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I said to the doorman &lsquo;Tell him he can stuff it&rsquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;A  day or so after I got a call from Stein&rsquo;s secretary to say he wanted to  see me at the ground. I went up to the park for the agreed time. But he  never faced me, instead it was Sean Fallon sent out. I thought that  summed up Stein.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I still went to Celtic games, but it was through the turnstiles.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;It  was only when Billy McNeill became manager six years later that I got  back in through the front door. Billy made me welcome again.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;There  was even an episode when Stein turned up at my house and called me a  bigot. He also said &lsquo;The fans don&rsquo;t want you and I don&rsquo;t want you&rsquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;My wife showed him the door. If he&rsquo;d stayed much longer I would have hit him.&rdquo;</span><span class="diffRemove">Through  the years diehard supporter Fallon has watched various Celtic keepers  struggle to avoid criticism, no matter how well they might be playing.</span><span class="diffRemove">He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very, very difficult being a Celtic goalkeeper.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t make one mistake. I met two wee boys recently who never even saw  me play and yet one of them said to me &lsquo;YOU, you sold the jerseys!&rsquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I came in at 19 years old and played with my heroes &mdash; Bertie Peacock, Bobby Evans, Eric Smith, Neilly Mochan.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I  felt I was as good as anybody. Thinking about my Celtic career fills me  with pride &mdash; seven League medals, two Scottish Cup, three League Cup,  two Glasgow Cup, the European Cup medal.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;I was part of two Treble- winning teams, 1967 and 1969.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  marvellous being Celtic No 1 when things are going well. But when  you&rsquo;ve blundered and the team&rsquo;s losing it can be hell. There&rsquo;s no hiding  place.</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;The best I&rsquo;ve seen since I left the club is Artur Boruc. Craig Gordon&rsquo;s not far behind him.&rdquo;</span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">Return of the European Cup medal</span><span class="diffRemove">Background:</span><span class="diffRemove">&ldquo;After we won the cup&hellip; we went to this restaurant, and  (Inter) Milan  were late in coming. I think they had taken the &lsquo;cream  puff&rsquo; because  they got beat. It took a long time, so we just wanted the  meal over with. They were  told to be there, so they came. They weren&rsquo;t  too happy; they weren&rsquo;t  talking to anybody. Billy (McNeill) was called  up by the president or the chairman, and he was handed this brown box,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your medals.&rdquo; He started with Ronnie, and gave everyone a medal&hellip;  There was one left, and he went, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo; So that was the 12th. I  remember putting it on the table, putting it into the top pocket of  my  blazer. We were sitting talking away, time passed, and Big Jock came   up.&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your medal?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in my pocket.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give me it.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; &ldquo;Aw, they forgot one for the referee.&rdquo; I gave him it, and I  got a replacement at the Christmas dance in  Glasgow&hellip; I just looked at  it and said, &ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the same medal.&rdquo;I never thought about it, and  it wasn&rsquo;t until somebody said to me,  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a real medal you&rsquo;ve  got.&rdquo; It didn&rsquo;t have a stamp on it and  it&rsquo;s a different colour&hellip; It&rsquo;s  more of a golden one. The European (medal)  was a red gold. When I  looked at my medal it was shiny. It (the  original) was made in  Switzerland; this one was made in Birmingham. It was a certain director,  who looked after a lot of the players  (Willie Haughey), turned around  and told me the real story &ndash; It went to  Bob Kelly&hellip; It never went to the  ref.&rdquo;</span><span class="diffRemove">John Fallon</span><span class="diffRemove">John Gets His Medal At Last April 2019</span><span class="diffRemove">I think we were all delighted to see that John Fallon got his real medal at last. Full marks to Mr Lawwell for bringing this about. It put right an injustice, which some people might even call &ldquo;theft&rdquo;.</span><span class="diffRemove">As you recall or as you have seen on You Tube if you are not old enough, circumstances dictated that there was no formal presentation of medals in that most disorganised of all European Cup finals. They simply could not cope with the Celtic fans, and Billy was, eventually given the European Cup without the other 10 men behind him. But wait a bit, that should be 11 men!</span><span class="diffRemove">John Fallon technically played in that game. He was wearing his strip under that tracksuit, and would have taken over if Ronnie Simpson had been injured. Six months later, incidentally, in Argentina, he had to do just that after Ronnie was felled by a missile. So Fallon was Celtic&rsquo;s 12th man as goalkeeper substitutions were allowed in the European Cup of that year. He also played a great part in ensuring that Helenio Herrera got the second choice of team bench, he and some other reserves making sure that they got there first and kept the seat warm for Jock! The game over, the teams met at the post match banquet. During this time Jock came up with a box, gave it to Billy McNeil who duly distributed the medals, including one for John Fallon. OK so far, but then Stein came back and asked John to give his medal back. Apparently, the Chairman was wanting it! Yes, the Chairman who, until he admitted he was wrong in 1965 and brought back Jock Stein, had lead the club to relentless mediocrity, was wanting a European Cup medal!</span><span class="diffRemove">And as he was the Chairman, he had to get what he wanted! John was later appeased when the club arranged to get another medal struck&hellip; but it wasn&rsquo;t the real medal. So anyway, justice has now been done to John, a man whom you will see at virtually every Celtic game, home and away. He will probably be holding court to all and sundry outside the Superstore. He is not snobby and you will probably hear him before you see him. He will greet you in his jovial way, he will shake your hand or rather your hand will sink into his huge goalkeeper hand! He will talk about Celtic past and present, and as they always say about all ex-Celts, he is just an ordinary man. His support of the team is by no means uncritical &ndash; he does not miss anyone and hit the wall &ndash; but it is genuine. His knowledge of the club is profound, and he now has his European Cup medal. John Fallon is a great Celt. </span><span class="diffRemove">David Potter</span><span class="diffRemove">Post-Note: </span><span class="diffRemove">The medal was finally returned to him in April 2019, deservedly.</span><span class="diffRemove">Return of the European Cup medal</span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><br><div></div><br></div>
