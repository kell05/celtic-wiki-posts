They would be foolish, however, to think that they can never be  beaten, and I don&rsquo;t believe they regret an occasional reverse after the  first pang is over.

The sight of  10,000 Celtic fans giving their team a standing ovation at the end  prompted Ancelotti to reflect that Scottish football followers could  teach their Italian counterparts a lesson in loving the game. <br></i>&ldquo;This  is what we need in Italy, this type of environment. This was the  essence of sport. To hear the Celtic fans singing and chanting after the  game was incredible.&rdquo; <br><b>Ancelotti (AC Milan Manager 2007, Fri. March 9th London Times).</b><br><br>&quot;Rangers or Celtic? <br>My  first feeling was Celtic. When I was 13 years old I saw for the first  time in my life a European Cup final - Inter against Celtic. That image  is, even today, clear in my mind; that day, that game, Jimmy Johnstone,  Riva... I was so impressed. When I was in Mozambique, far away from  football in Europe, I always remembered that day and that team.  Especially because when they started to play in the national stadium in  Portugal I thought Celtic were Sporting Lisbon because they dressed like  Sporting.&quot;<br><b>Carlos Quieroz (Man U assistant manager in 2007)</b><br><br><i>William  Gaillard (UEFA&#39;s director of communications and public affairs)  speaking after the European Cup final between Liverpool and AC Milan in  2007, was asked about what is going to be done in the future when  another British club gets into the final and there is the same problems  of fan behaviour/troubles getting into the ground. His answer?</i><br>&quot;......Well,  Celtic fans a couple of years ago went to Seville in the Uefa Cup Final  and took over 3 times the amount of fans there. There was not one bit  of trouble as all the fans that had no tickets stayed in the square and  had a big party.
