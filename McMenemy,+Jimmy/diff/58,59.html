The title bestowed on him of &#39;<i>Napoleon</i>&#39; was an apt epithet of his ability and aura, a commander on the pitch who could outwit his opponents and leave them crushed. An intelligent and forward thinking player, he was one who really moulded &#39;The Celtic Way&#39; of playing football in first two decades of the twentieth century, a very pivotal time in the evolution of the game.<br><br>Signed from Rutherglen Glencairn in June 1902 he made a scoring debut in a 3-0 league victory at Port Glasgow on 22nd November 1902. It was an impressive first outing for the inside-left but few could have guessed that this match was the start of a special relationship which would last for the best part of two decades. His longevity was exceptional, overshadowed only by that of colleagues&#39; Willie Maley as manager in his 43 year stint and Alec McNair who played even far more matches.<br><br>An abundantly talented footballer with the vision and intelligence to dictate a game McMeneny was nicknamed &#39;<i>Napoleon</i>&#39; and he marshalled the Celtic forward line which bossed Scottish football for a generation. Grand nicknames were not uncommon especially if they were bestowed by Willie Maley.<br><br>Quick feet, a good header of the ball and an excellent passer McMenemy was a major player in the Celtic sides which won 11 championships in his time at the club. He possessed an astute tactical awareness which when coupled with his talent with the ball allowed him to control and dictate games. He was also a calm and collected figure, able to keep his head in the heat of the most ferocious battle.<br><br>His intelligent scheming led to the downfall of rivals on a weekly basis as Willie Maley&#39;s Celtic developed into an all conquering football superpower. McMenemy&#39;s combination of brain and brawn made him the most formidable of opponent for any defence. This was typified in the match against Rangers on Ne&#39;er day 1914 when McMenemy cleverly dribbled around five men before smashing the ball high into the goal. It was a moment that clearly illustrated his sublime talent. Celtic were to be peerless throughout much of the war, and McMenemy was a great part of that, keeping spirits high on the homefront as was requested by the authorities.<br><br>On the pitch, he was not the most vocal but one incident brought out a fine quip from <span class="diffRemove">our</span><span class="diffAdd">the</span> great man: <br><blockquote><i>The game [Celtic 1-1 Barnsley 3 Sep 1912] was anything but &#39;friendly&#39; with Barnsley from Yorkshire where  (where they still boast about breeding them tough with chips on both  shoulders) attacking Celtic rather than tackling them in the relentless  rain. McMenemy, who normally never said a great deal on the field or  afterwards complained to Utley about the constant fouling. Utley said:  &quot;In English football, this team of yours wouldn&#39;t last a month&quot;,  McMenemy replied by saying &quot;In Scottish football, yours wouldn&#39;t last a  match&quot;.  </i><br></blockquote><br>He managed to make a name with Celtic in two different eras, first was the magnificent era in the first decade of the 1900&#39;s which saw Celtic win six league titles in a row, in a side with very fine footballers. Then in the 1910&#39;s again with another great side despite first being thought to be on his way out (he was far from it). <br><b><br></b>McMenemy left Celtic for a season having retired from the game. Not fully clear why but likely age, wear and tear had taken its toll. Due to his knees and age, rather than join the war he was instead stationed in munitions factories in Ayr and then Glasgow. Napoleon returned to the Bhoys the next summer to a rapturous welcome from fans and he stayed at Parkhead until June 1920. His motivation had returned and the old &#39;knees&#39; seemed to have recovered. Some may query why he returned, but it&#39;s a wish that most footballers after the end of their careers could only dream about, to have that one more chance.<br><br>This was to be a swansong as unlikely there was to be a further opportunity again at his age. <br><br>To the pleasant surprise of many, it was to be an Indian Summer for him as one author wrote. Celtic regained some of their old spirit and fought to win the league, something they had monopolised for much of the past twenty years. Great days again. McMenemy was even retitled as being Celtic&#39;s &#39;Foch&#39; in reference to the French military commander, but Napoleon was better as it is more grandiose.<br><br>With Celtic he helped them push towards another league title in 1918-19, using his experience and skill to push us all the way against a strong Rangers side. The final season was more difficult and sadly was no success but the support was still glad to have him.The disappointment of the last season saw a clear-out needed and due to his age, it was no surprise to see McMenemy be moved on. <br><br>It was all over at Celtic and his departure was another marker noting the end of one of Celtic&#39;s glorious chapters. The club was to then begin a slow decline after his departure (albeit with some brief periods of success), but how could you replace someone like him? While with Celtic he played 515 times and scored 168 goals in winning 11 Championships and 6 Scottish Cups. <br><br>For McMenemy, there was one last bit of glory. Having moved to Partick Thistle he continued to play and helped win the club to win the Scottish Cup, defeating Rangers in the final. It was a glorious way to end his playing days (albeit he carried on for a short while longer). The incredible part is that he was now over 40.<br><br>One story is that after winning that last Scottish Cup against Rangers  in 1921, he asked his wife what should he do  with  the medal (likely in knowledge it would be his last). Her reply: <br><blockquote>&quot;<i>Oh, just chuck it in the drawer with all  the  others!</i>&quot;.<br></blockquote><br>A marvellous player whom we should all be proud to be able to number as one of our own.<b><br></b><br><b>As Celtic Coach &amp; Assistant Manager</b><br><b><img align="right" alt="Jimmy McMenemy - Kerrydale Street" height="334" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/KM2dZcgWSegjGTtd2QnITQ30285/GW251H334" title="Jimmy McMenemy - Kerrydale Street" width="251"></b>  He returned to Celtic for a role on the coaching staff between 1935 and 1940, where he was invited back as a trainer and Assistant Manager to Willie Maley. <br><br>During this period, Celtic went through what can be described as Celtic&rsquo;s last great period for twenty years (even though the success was brief). Possibly it signalled the closing chapter of Celtic&rsquo;s first 50 years of success, although the club had been underachieving for much of the time since McMenemy had hung up his boots.<br><br>Prior to McMenemey&#39;s return, Celtic&#39;s decline was accelerating and needed action taken. The club&#39;s domestic hegemony was long gone. One bright point for Jimmy McMenemy was that one of his sons, <a href="/page/McMenemy%2C+John" target="_self">John McMenemy</a>, played briefly for Celtic and helped the club to a Scottish Cup title, the seventh in the family. Another son, Harry McMenemy, played for Newcastle Utd.<br><br>Willie Maley&rsquo;s time was nearing the end as a manager but he still stubbornly stuck out despite growing numbers wishing (for the right reasons) that he step down. With age he became more cantankerous and obstinate. Bringing in McMenemy was a masterstroke by the board, his arrival on 15 Oct 1934 was greeted with great enthusiasm by all at Celtic. <br><br>McMenemy was by nature a self-effacing and mild-mannered person, and he carried this over to the coaching side. He was to be the Ying to Willie Maley&rsquo;s Yang, being more relaxed and approachable for the players to confide in him and even joke with. Results improved from the off, and part of this was his work on improving the team tactics and mentoring young talent (such as the great Jimmy Delaney). His input led to Celtic playing a fast entertaining style that even the difficult Willie Maley was said to warm to it.<br><br>Success was paramount, especially as Celtic had not won the league title in around ten years. The challenge was taken up, and under the coaching from McMenemy, Celtic went onto win two leagues titles in 1935-36 and 1937-38 and the Scottish Cup in 1937 (a famous victory over Aberdeen before a record 146,433 fans). <br><br>It is probably fair to say that this success at Celtic was far more to do with McMenemy than Willie Maley, and he was the de facto manager. He was to be as important to Celtic as a coach as much as he was a player.<br><br>McMenemy was so good as the assistant to Maley that he was even given an assistant himself (Joe Dodds). Possibly this was an early sign that McMenemy was to be made the main manager with Willie Maley to get the message to finally step-down. However, it wasn&rsquo;t to be. It is argued that McMenemy&rsquo;s self-effacing and more relaxed manner didn&rsquo;t fit the then typecast of a manager as straight-laced. Surely his record (as both a player &amp; coach) and his love for the club should have been enough? Sadly no, and he was said to not have even been considered, the role passing to Jimmy McStay (admittedly a very worthy candidate himself).<br><br>Wartime was to begin in 1939, and Celtic had already begun to slip after the 1937-38 seasons for various reasons. Jimmy McMenemy cannot be wholly absolved for his part in the slip however he wasn&rsquo;t the one making the final decisions and the loss of great players (such as Willie Buchan) with no replacements or fresh blood meant that he cannot be held entirely responsible either (nor should he be). <br><br>Despite being kept on once Jimmy McStay took the reins at Celtic, he didn&rsquo;t stay long and left Celtic in the summer of 1940. It is not known if it was his choice or he was pushed. We shouldn&rsquo;t concentrate on this point but rather remember the great memories that he left at Celtic as a coach as much as a player.  <br><br>Quite simply a Celtic great. <br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>Always a great Celt, he stuck firm by the club as a supporter even during <span class="diffRemove">our</span><span class="diffAdd">the</span> barren years in the late 1950&#39;s/early 1960&#39;s, stating in a speech to a Celtic Supporter&#39;s Association that <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> would soon be back on winning terms. <span class="diffRemove">We</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> were <span class="diffAdd">to finally turn things around </span>but that was in 1965 with the momentous Scottish Cup win. It must have been painful for such a great to see <span class="diffRemove">us</span><span class="diffAdd">the Celtic First</span> <span class="diffAdd">Team </span>wait so long before <span class="diffRemove">we could regain</span><span class="diffAdd">regaining</span> <span class="diffRemove">our</span><span class="diffAdd">their</span> pride once more. <br><br>Sadly, Jimmy McMenemy died very shortly after that victory, passing away in June 1965. That victory was to be a turning point for the club, and he was to miss the golden period for the club under Jock Stein. He would have been so proud to have seen the club that he helped build during its first golden period and buttress during some of its most difficult days, now scale the heights back to the top where it belonged.<br><br><i>*According to Frank Worrall, in his book &quot;Celtic United&quot; (Mainstream Publishing) James McMenemy is the Great uncle of Lawrie McMenemy, manager of 1976 F.A.

He was born in 1880 and played from 1902 until 1920 at a time when Celtic had two really great teams, 1905-1910 and 1914 &ndash; 1917, and when the managerial powers of Willie Maley were at their height. In some ways, McMenemy typified the Celtic of that era &ndash; a tricky dribbler, a brilliant passer, a cannonball shot (unusual in such a small and slightly built man) and a great team player with loyalty and level-headedness his hallmarks.<br><br>His nickname was Napoleon. It is a curious one when one considers that the original Bonaparte had been the Britain &#39;s greatest enemy until the grizzly horrors of the Kaiser and Hitler came along later in the 20 th century. Why would a footballer be named Napoleon? In fact, Jimmy had a certain resemblance to old Boney. He was about the same height and build, but the real answer must lie in his brainpower and his ability to transfer his considerable intellectual capacity to a football field. Napoleon was respected even by his opponents for that. So was Jimmy McMenemy.<br><br>He joined Celtic from Rutherglen Glencairn, signing, legend has it, &ldquo;up a close in Union Street &rdquo;, as Maley began his ingathering of talent. His first season was no great success, but by the end of 1904, the first great Celtic team had taken off, and the forward line of Bennett, McMenemy, Quinn, Somers and Hamilton had no equal in world football. For six years they won the Championship with the crafty McMenemy holding the ball, slowing things down, reading Quinn perfectly for the incisive pass and performing a vital link in the right wing triangle with Sunny Jim and Alec Bennett which exuded excellence.<br><br>Even when that great team broke up after 1910, with McMenemy now 30 and entitled to consider that his best years were behind him, Maley had other plans for Napoleon. In December 1911, McMenemy was being challenged for his place by a prodigiously talented Irishman called Patsy Gallacher. Rather than try to bully the spindle shanked, emaciated looking youngster out of the team, McMenemy approached Maley with the suggestion that Gallacher should indeed take his place at inside right while he (McMenemy) would play at inside left. This was a total success and by 1914 another great Celtic team was in place &ndash; arguably as good as the one of ten years ago, but destined to be denied by the Kaiser of the chance to prove it.<br><br>By this time, McMenemy had played 11 times for Scotland (he would earn another cap after the Great War) and had never been on a losing side. Along with Jimmy Quinn, he played a glorious part in the 1910 2-0 win over England at Hampden, and in 1914 it was he and Willie Reid of Rangers who won the day for Scotland . A week after that game, with McMenemy the hero of the hour, Celtic played Hibs at Ibrox in the Scottish Cup Final and after an ineffective first game, McMenemy and Gallacher destroyed Hibs in the Replay to land the League and Cup double for the third time in his career.<br><br>The forward line of McAtee, Gallacher, McColl, McMenemy and Browning would be chanted and repeated frequently in the trenches of Flanders (and possibly even the Post Office of Dublin) in future years. It might even have been the last words that some soldiers said. Some cried for their wives, some their mothers, others for Jimmy McMenemy!<br><br>Jimmy himself continued to play during the war years, working in the munitions industry as well, as circumstances demanded. League titles were won in 1915, 1916 and 1917, but there was no Scottish Cup, nor Scotland Internationals. In 1918, he may well have thought about retirement at the age of 38 after the effects of an injury. In addition conscription looked like catching up with him. For some reason, however, his papers never came, and then in November Germany surrendered, thus allowing Napoleon to return to Celtic Park . The crowd rose to welcome him back, and by the end of the 1918-19 season he had won his 11 th League Championship for Celtic, although it must be said that three of them were war-time ones. Although unofficial, they are by necessity demeaned by the unreal circumstances obtaining at the time.<br><br>In summer 1920, with his 40 th birthday fast approaching, Maley let Jimmy go, paying full praise to one of his greatest and longest serving players. He was snatched up immediately by Partick Thistle, and astounded the world in April 1921 by helping the Thistle to their one and only Scottish Cup victory. Indeed it was McMenemy&#39;s pass which fed Blair to score the winning goal in the Final. Appropriately, the opponents were Rangers and even more appropriately the venue was Parkhead!<br><br>Thus Jimmy won a record seven Scottish Cup medals &ndash; 1904, 1907, 1908,1911, 1912, 1914 and now 1921. It could have been more, but he was prevented by the Hampden Riot of 1909 and the five years of the Great War. Billy McNeill would, in later years, equal that record and Bobby Lennox, technically, would beat it, although some of Bobby&#39;s Cup Final medals came via the substitutes&#39; bench.<br><br>Yet Napoleon&#39;s contribution to Celtic was, even then, not finished. In 1934, he was invited back to Parkhead as trainer and de facto Assistant Manager to his old mentor, the ageing and increasingly prickly Willie Maley. Such a move was almost akin to the return of Jock Stein in 1965, in that it really should have happened earlier, but when it did, the results were startling. It was due to McMenemy in no small measure that the great sides of 1936, 1937 and 1938 appeared, with Napoleoen nurturing the precocious young talent of Delaney, Buchan, Murphy and Crum to the glory year of the Empire Exhibition Trophy.<br><br>He was dismissed in 1940, but did not take umbrage. He remained a faithful Celt, talking to newspapers and everyone else about their prospects. People would recognise him on a train or in the street, nudge one another and say, &ldquo;That&#39;s McMenemy!&rdquo;<br><br>He supported Celtic through the awful years of the 1940s and lived long enough to see the Hoops win the Scottish Cup of 1965 when Jock Stein returned. Sadly he died in the summer that year at the age of 85, one of the greatest Celts of all time.<br><br>His family kept up the football tradition. His son John won a Scottish Cup medal for Celtic in 1927, Harry played for Newcastle United and of course Laurie McMenemy, the former Manager of Southampton and many other teams, is the great-nephew of Napoleon.<br><br>Unlike the French Emperor, there was no Waterloo , no Elba , no St. Helena , no humiliation. His legacy continued and he remains one of the great characters of Celtic history.
