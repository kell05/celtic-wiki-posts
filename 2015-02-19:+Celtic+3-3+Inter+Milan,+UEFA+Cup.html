Celtic went behind two down in just twelve minutes to flatten the atmosphere and supporter morale. Cue much whining and gnashing of teeth on the team, players, tactics, the rotten weather on the day etc. <br> <br> All changed with am incredible recovery th saw Celtic reply with two goals that should have taken us into the interval level pegging. Except Craig Gordon was making uncharacteristic errors, and Inter grabbed a third to give them a lead. <br> <br> Second half saw Celtic huff and puff, keeping possession and playing some good football. Making the runs and penetrating the opposition defence, we were taking chances but not converting. <br> <br> Then at the death the underminded Guidetti scored the equaliser on 90+3 mins, to send the support into raptures. This after going through a barren spell of games of late, and having been dropped as first choice striker.<br> <br> Nobody really thought we could do it, and taking in the shambles of Deila&#39;s first half season, this was a major result for him. Prior he had spoken of this being a test to measure our progress, and granted we may not have won but it showed that the team was on the right road. <br> <br> Onto the next round, and we can only hope to finally win our first ever match on Italian soil. <br><br><i>(NoPaseran of KDS)</i><br>First time in my life that I have left a football match feeling as  elated and frustrated all at once. Defensively we were all over the  place but going forward we looked as good as we have since the MON days.  I really didn&#39;t think we had the character in us to come from behind  twice at this level, massive credit to the entire team for that.<br><br>I  could dedicate half this post to moaning about our defensive  performance but I won&#39;t because every player has an off night and it was  just unfortunate that a few of our back 5 were poor in the same game. I  take comfort from the fact we will be much improved defensively next  week and we almost certainly won&#39;t make as many individual mistakes.  Tbh, if we cut out the errors I really do think we will qualify   <br><br>Hats  off to Bitton (my MOTM) and Brown who were absoultely outstanding in  the middle of the park. Armstrong took to the occasion like a duck to  water, was this his first European appearance?    GMS got caught napping defensively a few times but his directness and  drive going forward was terrific. We definitely have goals in us next  week, Inters back 4 cannot deal with the ball in behind or players  running at them. Expecting a 4-3 in Milan  <br><br>P.S  I think the fans should get an assist for the 2nd goal, the Inter  players had no idea what was going on for a good 10 minutes <br><br><i>(Markybhoy of KDS)</i><br>First chance I&#39;ve had to post since last night. Does &#39;ooft&#39; just about cover it? <br><br>I  was pretty annoyed by the first goal, it looked like it came just too  early. Gordon not settled or too eager or something, to realise it was  going well wide but of course the parry lands right back at his feet and  of course the opposition only needed 1 shot to put it through our  keepers legs. Then obviously what we needed was for a rather panicky  clearance to bounce off VVD&#39;s napper and fall perfectly for Palacio ffs!  <br><br>Do you ever wonder if that kinda pish happens to other teams? <br><br>To  come back from that was just fantastic though. I thought Mathews had  his best game for a while, though still look frail defensively but I  felt nothing but optimism approaching half time. <br><br>Craig Gordon  looks like he is about to burst out greetin at the best of times but I  cannot for the life of me think what he was doing there. Given how wet  the surface was that ball was only picking up speed when it hit the deck  and Palacio did start to ease off the gas. Again I can&#39;t help but think  it was because Gordon didn&#39;t get a chance to settle down. His kicking  was woeful and he just looked a bit shellshocked. Look at how well he  performed after managing to pull off a couple of saves in the second  half. Says something for his character that he managed to do that though  so onwards and upwards. Possibly better keepers than Gordon have made  similar mistakes in big games, chin up lad. <br><br>I&#39;m just glad to be  enjoying my football again. Speaking to a Man Utd work mate this morning  he&#39;s gutted. His team are dull and he&#39;s really losing the will with  LVG. I asked him if he listened to LVG pre/post match, no he says.  Instantly switch off. That&#39;s when you know you&#39;re losing the love of  watching your team I think. <br><br>We might not make it through (unlikely but who knows) but to hell with it. At least we&#39;re playing it the Glasgow Celtic way. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams<br></h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    26  Gordon         </li><li>    02  Matthews      (Ambrose Emuobo - 81&#39;

Campagnaro [OG] 26; Guidetti 90+3) Inter 3 (Shaqiri 4; Palacio 13, 45).<br><br>The Swedish striker stepped off the subs&rsquo; bench to net his first goal in 11 appearances for Ronny Deila&rsquo;s side and keep their hopes of further progress alive.<br><br>On an evening when they needed to be firing on all cylinders, Celtic&rsquo;s hopes looked to have been fatally derailed by a malfunction of their normally most reliable component.<br><br>Craig Gordon, whose exceptional goalkeeping was the biggest single factor in them reaching this stage of the tournament, endured an uncharacteristically wretched evening. Celtic found themselves two goals behind to Inter after just 13 minutes with Gordon at fault for the first of them by Xherdan Shaqiri.<br><br>Stuart Armstrong hauled Celtic level before half an hour had elapsed, scoring one and forcing an own goal from the rattled Italians. But another howler from Gordon allowed Rodrigo Palacio to plunder his second goal just before half time.<br><br>It looked to have given Inter a lead to take into next Thursday&rsquo;s second leg at San Siro before Guidetti&rsquo;s late intervention.<br><br>After creating a cacophonous Champions League-style atmosphere in the build-up, the home support had the wind taken out of their sails by their team&rsquo;s calamitous start to the contest.<br><br>Just as they had in their previous knock-out tie with Italian opposition, against Juventus in the last 16 of the Champions League two years ago, Celtic conceded the opening goal within the opening four minutes. It came from a rare error of judgment by Gordon. His outstanding performances in the group stage of this tournament often compensated for the defensive vulnerability in front of him. But the perfectionist in Gordon would not be pleased with his part in Inter&rsquo;s breakthrough. Although left exposed by Zdravko Kuzmanovic&rsquo;s ball over the top of the defence which picked out Shaqiri&rsquo;s run, he was less than convincing as he clawed the Swiss striker&rsquo;s initial shot straight back into his path. The former Bayern Munich player seized upon the loose ball and calmly guided it into the net.<br><br>It was the kind of start Deila&rsquo;s men would have dreaded and, to a man, they appeared rattled. It would get worse before it got better. Slack play from Virgil van Dijk presented Kuzmanovic with Inter&rsquo;s next chance which he wastefully scooped over. But the visitors&rsquo; second was only delayed until the 13th minute.<br><br>Gordon was more effective in dealing with a Shaqiri shot this time as he turned the ball behind. But from the corner, taken by Kuzmanovic, Celtic were all over the place defensively. Shaqiri helped the ball back into the area where it broke off Van Dijk for Palacio to drive a firm, low shot beyond Gordon.<br><br>When Gordon then had to make a decent stop to deny Mauro Icardi, Celtic appeared on the verge of total collapse.<br><br>But they gradually recovered a measure of composure before displaying considerable resilience to battle their way back. It was breathless stuff as Celtic stunned Inter with two goals in as many minutes to level matters.<br><br>Armstrong will certainly never forget his home debut for Celtic. The midfielder sparked the revival in the 24th minute with one of the perfectly-timed runs into the penalty area which became his trademark at Dundee United. It allowed him to get on the end of a well-judged cutback from Adam Matthews and slot a low shot past the left hand of Inter keeper Juan Pablo Carrizo into the corner of the net.<br><br>The grateful celebrations of the Celtic fans had hardly subsided when they were greeting an equaliser. Stefan Johansen was the provider from the right this time, the Norwegian&rsquo;s cross causing panic in the Inter defence. Under pressure from Armstrong, full-back Hugo Campagnaro bundled the ball into his own net.<br><br>The momentum was firmly with Celtic at this stage and it required a brave save by Carrizo at the feet of Gary Mackay-Steven to prevent the winger joining his fellow new boy on the scoresheet. Inter looked every bit as uncertain at the back as Celtic but unfortunately for the hosts it was they who were punished again for another mistake by Gordon just before the interval.<br><br>Gary Medel&rsquo;s long through pass from his own half was intended for Palacio but was overhit as the ball ran into the penalty area. Gordon advanced for what should have been a routine interception but instead the ball slipped from his grasp and into the stride of Palacio who coolly stroked it into the far corner of the net.<br><br>The tempo of the contest subsided to the merely frantic after the break. Inter confounded the stereotype of Italian sides being content to sit on a lead, pouring forward at every opportunity. Palacio, on the hunt for a hat-trick, forced a smart save from Gordon who dived to his right to keep out a curling shot.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s response was a stinging long-range effort from Nir Bitton which flashed just wide. Mackay-Steven should have done better when he found himself one-on-one with Carrizo, sending in a tame shot which the goalkeeper blocked with his left foot. Leigh Griffiths was equally wasteful, shooting straight at Carrizo from close range after being set up by Johansen.<br><br>Guidetti replaced Griffiths with 15 minutes remaining and his impact was stunning. With the seconds ticking down in stoppage time, he got on the end of a long ball from Emilio Izaguirre and thumped a superb volley high into the net.<br><br>There was time for one more Inter attack and a degree of redemption for Gordon who, in the final piece of action before the final whistle, dived brilliantly to his left to keep out Shaqiri&rsquo;s free-kick.<br><br>CELTIC: Gordon; Matthews (Ambrose 81), van Dijk, Denayer, Izaguirre; Bitton, Brown; Armstrong (Henderson 75), Johansen, Mackay-Steven; Griffiths (Guidetti 75).

Gary Medel&#39;s hopeful through-ball looked like being safely gathered by Gordon, but he unfathomably allowed it to squirm from his grasp, allowing Palacio to tap into the unguarded net.<br><br>The irony that Celtic would, in all likelihood, be out of Europe were it not for some of Gordon&#39;s heroics in previous games was not lost on the home crowd, who chanted the keeper&#39;s name before the teams departed at the interval.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, the second half could not match the first for drama, yet both teams created opportunities.<br><br>Gordon earned some redemption by pushing another Shaqiri effort away, but Celtic were the more dangerous team and only good goalkeeping by Juan Pablo Carrizo denied Gary Mackay-Steven and Leigh Griffiths from close range.<br><br>Guidetti was introduced as a late substitute and despite seeing little of the ball, his late volley into the top corner, after Liam Henderson&#39;s chipped pass, had the home fans in ebullient mood by the final whistle.<br>It did not take Inter Milan long to take a 2-0 lead at Celtic Park<br><br>It did not take Inter Milan long to take a 2-0 lead at Celtic Park<br>Ronny Deila says the atmosphere was like nothing else he had ever experienced<br><br>Celtic manager Ronny Deila said the atmosphere was like nothing else he had ever experienced<br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 3, Inter Milan 3.<br>90:00 +5:11 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 3, Inter Milan 3.<br>90:00 +4:59<br><br>Attempt saved.

There were six goals and there could have been more.<br>If  Helenio Herrera, the godfather of catenaccio and iconic former manager  of Inter in their 1960s pomp, was watching up there in footballing  heaven, he would have been a bad man to be around.<br>&quot;We won without  getting off the bus,&quot; said Herrera when his Inter were at the height of  their powers. At Celtic Park, Inter got off the bus, got a two-goal lead  and still could not win.<br>No ground in the country can go from  stillness to craziness quite as quickly as Celtic Park on a European  night - and here it happened again. On evenings like this, the place is  akin to the world&#39;s biggest tumble dryer, the senses scrambled from a  90-minute spin cycle.<br>Bertie Auld<br>An appearance by Bertie Auld, a 1967 European Cup winner with Celtic, was part of the pre-match build-up<br>As  Celtic and Inter went at it toe-to-toe - and blunder for blunder - in  that madcap first half the mind drifted off to a different sport in an  attempt to describe what was going on.<br>It was like two fighters  abandoning their defence and throwing punches until their rival fell -  the footballing equivalent of Thomas &#39;The Hitman&#39; Hearns versus  Marvellous Marvin Hagler, a storied slugfest of the past.<br>When John  Guidetti fired in the goal that gave Celtic a draw, and a modicum of  hope for leg two in Milan next week, the scenes were not far off the  finest we have witnessed here in recent times. There was a Manchester  United-like euphoria, a Barcelona-esque delirium.<br>Billy McNeill and  his heroes of yesterday have seen it all, and done it all, but even for  the history men of Celtic Park this must have been a thriller.<br>They  were feted before kick-off and why wouldn&#39;t they be? This fixture evokes  certain memories and as soon as these clubs were paired together there  was an opportunity - an obligation - for Celtic to revel in in their  1967 European Cup final win over Inter in Portugal.<br>The Lisbon Lions  applauded the current generation on to the field and then sat back and  watched them play, like Picasso observing art school.<br>Roland Palacio scores for Inter Milan against Celtic<br>Defensive frailty dogged Celtic&#39;s first half against Inter<br>Some  of what they saw would have been alien to them - the wretched, and  almost ruinous, defensive frailties must have had the captain blinking  hard - but other things would have been oh so familiar.<br>Celtic have  troubling deficiencies at this level and they may cost them dear - they  have conceded 10 goals in their last three European matches and have won  just four out of 13 dating back to Champions League qualifiers in the  summer - but a lack of spirit is not an issue.<br>The fought hard  against Inter. They fought right until the end. If it&#39;s not heresy to  say it, they had something of the refuse-to-lose mentality of the  greatest Celtic team and it made for a thunderous evening.<br>Guidetti&#39;s  equaliser was about technique and precision but it was also about a  team&#39;s tenacity and pride and how the home fans responded to it.<br>The  Celtic fans left with smiles on their faces. They were entertained, that  was one reason. They saw their team overcome its own shortcomings, that  was another.<br>They can see the side getting better, a side that has  menace and bravery and a big work ethic in attack, and they can identify  with that. That&#39;s feel-good stuff. It&#39;s enough to be getting on with.<br>Celtic midfielder Stuart Armstrong<br>Recent signing Stuart Armstrong was one of Celtic&#39;s scorers<br>The  propensity for giving up soft goals? It doesn&#39;t seem too bad when it&#39;s  accompanied with an animalistic desire to make amends.<br>Celtic are  better now than they were in December, when they finished their Europa  League pool stage with a 4-3 defeat away to Dynamo Zagreb.<br>They are  better offensively, if not defensively. Back then, they had Mubarak  Wakaso and Callum McGregor out wide and now they have the goals and pace  and creativity of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven.<br>Back  then, they had an unconvincing Stefan Scepovic up front and now they  have an in-form Leigh Griffiths and, in his stead, Guidetti, liberated  at last from whatever stunted his progress over the last two-and-a-half  goal-less months.<br>Stefan Johansen is getting better all the time. Nir  Bitton is becoming a player of substance. Kris Commons has much to  contribute.<br>Ronny Deila&#39;s team have been playing with more conviction  this past while but it was conviction on a domestic stage and nobody  knew for sure what relevance their upturn in form was going to have  against a higher class of opposition.<br>Mauro Icardi and Virgil van Dijk<br>The two sides will meet again in Milan next Thursday<br>We  know now that they have the firepower to trouble a team like Inter. The  Italians are not the force of before, far from it. But they are a  reasonable gauge at this stage of Celtic&#39;s development under Deila.<br>The  word on Inter&#39;s defence was that they are jumpy when pressed. Celtic  were good enough to expose, and punish, that jumpiness. You would not  back against them doing it again next week in Milan.<br>This is a team  of two halves, though. They can score but, boy, they can concede, in all  sorts of silly ways. They&#39;ve scored six goals in their last two  European matches and have not won either of them because they&#39;ve  conceded seven. It makes for exciting times, but with a sieve at the  back then their European destiny will be to do more entertaining than  winning.<br>This is the challenge for Deila - and he&#39;s got precious  little time in which to get it right. A balance has to be struck in time  for Milan between attacking threat and defensive liability. He&#39;s  cracked one, but he&#39;s made little progress in cracking the other.<br>At  the moment, he&#39;s got something of a castle built on sand. There&#39;s much  to admire on the face of it, but it looks doomed to failure on the  bigger stage unless the foundations are more solid.<br>Deila has got a  week to add stability to the flair. A win in Milan in the second leg?  It&#39;s improbable, but, then, so was the comeback on Thursday night. And  what a night. 						 						 						 					<br></div></div>
