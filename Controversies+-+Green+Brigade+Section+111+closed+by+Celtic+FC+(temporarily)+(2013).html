Following years of requests from the club, Section 111 of the ground was shut down. <br><br>The issue revolved around that despite repeat warnings the section was not adhering to the requests by the club for health and safety reasons that could jeopardise the club&#39;s certificate from the council and see the ground close. This Green Brigade though retort that the club is exaggerating and just pushing their weight around, with the aim to crush on keep the group at heel. <br><br>Regardless of what side you may take, it&#39;s not an ideal situation. This Green Brigade for all their political stances are really just lads creating a good atmosphere, and their banners have become legendary. <br><br>Saying that they Green Brigades have not always helped their case with their behaviour at times and at times arrogant stances against anyone who disagrees with their latest crusade (even if it&#39;s many of the Celtic support themselves). Regardless they have done a fine job overall, and deserve some leeway.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Green Brigade Statement</h3>5 Aug 2013<br>The Green Brigade are disappointed to announce that our section in 111 is to be closed by Celtic Football Club. Pathetically, this is due to &lsquo;lateral movement&rsquo; which has been deemed &lsquo;unsafe&rsquo; by the club&rsquo;s directors. Our group and section has continually made concessions and strived to be co-operative with the club over various safety concerns so we are left dismayed that such drastic and immediate action has been taken over such a trivial and harmless movement. <br><br>The group is currently seeking legal advice and will consult with those in our section over the coming days. A detailed statement shall be released over the next few days and we&#39;d advise all within our section to take no action until we have had the opportunity to discuss our options together. We would like to stress that this is not the end of the Green Brigade. Decisions and hurdles like these will only strengthen our group&#39;s resolve. We would like to thank the Celtic support who have continually backed, funded and inspired our group from our formation to the present day and can assure you that none of this support will have been in vain.<br><br>Until the last rebel.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic Football Club statement</h3>CelticFc.net<br>By: Newsroom Staff on 05 Aug, 2013 18:11<br><br>AS highlighted recently, the safety of all spectators is of paramount importance to Celtic Football Club. Given recent events, we have been left with no option but to take steps to ensure the safety of our supporters. We trust that supporters will recognise that the Club has been placed in an impossible position.<br><br>It is therefore with extreme regret that for safety reasons, the Club has taken the decision to relocate supporters currently sitting within Area 111 of the Stadium, where there have been continued examples of unsafe behaviour. Supporters who do not wish to be relocated may choose to receive a pro rata refund and return their season ticket.<br><br>Stadium safety is covered by a Stadium General Safety Certificate, which is issued annually by Glasgow City Council in terms of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Without our Safety Certificate, we could not open and operate the Stadium. <br><br>In order to protect our Safety Certificate, it is essential that we comply with all of our duties in terms of safety for spectators at Celtic Park. Unsafe behaviour at Celtic Park is not acceptable and we have made our position on this clear.<br><br>Under advice from the Safety Advisory Group, which includes representatives of Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Scottish Ambulance Service, Police Scotland and the Council, it is open to Glasgow City Council to enforce a reduction in stadium capacity or, ultimately, to close a stadium. <br><br>In recent matches against Cliftonville, Borussia Monchengladbach and Ross County there were examples of at least one of the five primary concerns of the Safety Advisory Group taking place. <br><br>These include:<br>- Overcrowding<br>- Moshing (mock fighting/jostling causing crowd disruption)<br>- Body Surfing<br>- Lateral Movement<br>- Broken Seating<br><br>The Safety Advisory Group has made clear that they have serious concerns regarding these issues at Celtic Park. We have made this clear to supporters. <br><br>The Club issued a statement on our website on July 25 and, most recently, the Club issued a final warning on July 29 explaining our concerns and making clear that the current situation relative to unsafe behaviour had to stop with immediate effect. Having acknowledged that this was the case for our match against Elfsborg, there were, unfortunately, more examples of unsafe behaviour at our match on Saturday, August 3, 2013 against Ross County. <br><br>At the match against Ross County a section of supporters engaged in lateral movement. It may seem to some that lateral movement is not unsafe. As noted above, that view is not shared by the Safety Advisory Group, or the Club. The Stadium is not designed for movement of that sort, leading to an increased risk of falling and injury. The movement led to seats being broken, which also presents a risk of injury. We are sure that supporters will agree that this behaviour is unsafe, particularly where there are young supporters in the area in question.<br><br>This is not a decision that has been taken lightly. Supporters in this section provide the team with excellent vocal backing. We have also seen some highly imaginative and original displays which have brought colour and energy to Celtic Park and the Club has on a number of occasions acknowledged the positive contribution the group make on a match day. We must, however, balance this against the need to ensure that we provide a safe environment for all supporters. <br><br>Unfortunately, Saturday saw 35 seats damaged within this section, meaning a total of 190 seats have been damaged in this area over the last four matches at Celtic Park. <br><br>In addition, the Club also remains under investigation by UEFA following events at the recent match against Cliftonville.<br><br>We are sure all our supporters understand that it would be inconceivable and irresponsible for the Club not to deal with this issue with the utmost seriousness. We are sure our supporters will also agree that we have given those fans within this section every opportunity to change behaviour. However, the Club has now been left with no choice. Safety is paramount.<br><br>The Club&rsquo;s sole motivation in this situation is the safety of its supporters - nothing else. The Club and its Directors are ultimately liable for the safety of all supporters within Celtic Park and failure to ensure their safety could have serious repercussions.<br><br>Celtic, of course, was instrumental in developing this section with supporters in good faith, ensuring that other supporters were moved from their seats to allow this area could be created. We have welcomed the colour and atmosphere which supporters in this section have brought to Celtic Park. We have no desire to take this action and we have tried to deal with these issues in the proper way through dialogue and mutual respect.<br><br>We have always been willing to speak to those supporters in this section. Indeed, we have spoken to representatives today and once again outlined our concerns and the action we must take.<br><br>We will be happy to continue this dialogue and if the Club were to receive assurances on safety then we may look at this situation again in the future. However, as it stands the Club categorically but regrettably has no choice but to take this action.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>KDS forum - Fair consensus opinion</h3>(Bumblebee Tuna of KDS, 6 Aug 2013)<br>I think it&rsquo;s sad that events since were so predictable.<br><br>The club have clearly had enough of asking you to comply with the rules. It just doesn&rsquo;t work and that leaves closure as their only available option. The response to that from the GB and other GB members on here has been nothing but juvenile and petulant.<br><br>The club is not out to get you FFS. The club&rsquo;s statement was very clear on what they see as the problems (moshing, lateral movement, breaking of seats) and the club is clearly feeling pressure from external sources to resolve this. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what other people are getting away with, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s petty, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s all silly health &amp; safety nonsense (which it is) and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if other fans support you. The only thing that matters is the club get these other people off their back and the only way that can happen is either the banned stuff stops or the section closes. <br><br>You had your chance to resolve this after the Cliftonville game when the club made it clear this was the last warning (that came across very clear in their statement at the time), but you didn&rsquo;t. You went and broke the rules again and have forced the club into this position. Don&rsquo;t worry though, now that you&rsquo;ve forced the club to close the section you can all play the victim card and pretend the clubs is somehow at fault on this. How many times have the club, privately and publically, said they can&rsquo;t allow this stuff at games? Yet you persist. You&rsquo;re not victims, you&rsquo;re idiots.<br><br>Why not conform to what the club are asking? Is it really worth chucking the whole section away because you want to do lateral movement? Are you now at a point where you&rsquo;ve just become stubborn and don&rsquo;t want to back down because it&rsquo;s embarrassing? I don&rsquo;t know, but that&rsquo;s exactly what it looks like from the outside. <br><br>Please stop with this &ldquo;watered down&rdquo; pish as well. Watered down is just a silly way of saying they want you stick to the rules and stop the stuff that&rsquo;s causing problems. The club want you there. The club put you there in the first place FFS. They want you to support the team with your banners and displays, support the team with your singing and drums and support the team with your passion. Why can&rsquo;t you just do that? It&rsquo;s a reasonable request; bring all the good parts and stop all the parts that are causing hassle. You don&rsquo;t get to pick and choose which rules you are allowed to break and chucking it all away because you don&rsquo;t want to stop shows again how immature you&rsquo;re being.<br><br>Some of the responses have been so ridiculously childish. Saying the club gave up on the standing issue as justification for continuing the lateral movement for example. Surely the fact the club gave up on this issue just highlights that the club is willing to concede on a point if it finds it to be reasonable. The fact that they aren&rsquo;t conceding on the other stuff means they find it wholly unacceptable and it must be stopped. So stop it.<br><br>The whole &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t us, it was the hangers on&rdquo; excuse (known as the Manchester excuse) being trotted out for certain things is also embarrassing, as is the whole I love the club but not the PLC crap. It&rsquo;s exactly the type of embarrassing comments we rip into the huns for. We keep getting told that the GB aren&rsquo;t just silly teenagers but the way you&rsquo;ve responded to this whole mess suggests differently. <br><br>The breaking of seats is wholly unacceptable also. I doubt very much the club are making this claim up, it would go against everything else the club does and it smacks of the same petulant nonsense from the folks in 111 who don&rsquo;t want to admit they might be in the wrong here. You even posted a photograph of the section to prove you don&rsquo;t break seats that actually contained broken seats FFS. The photograph also showed graffiti scrawled across seats; you do realise that the club will also have to replace these seats don&rsquo;t you? Whether you like or not the club wish to use the stadium for other events (CG Opening Ceremony for one) and having graffiti scrawled on seats is unacceptable and will cost the club money to fix, so why are you doing this?<br><br>Most of the fans support the GB in relation to the Police stuff, but please don&rsquo;t confuse this with support for everything you do. I know a lot of fans who are season tickets holder who don&rsquo;t post here and they are all fed up with this GB vs the club pish. They are fed up hearing about it, support for you guys is weaning and taking legal action against the club will reduce support for you further in my opinion.<br><br>You also complain about the club not supporting you in regards to the Police situation (something most fans do support you in and wish you well with) but be realistic. The club cannot possibly declare support for a group of guys who continually break their rules as well as the law. If you guys didn&rsquo;t break the rules then maybe the club would find it a lot easier to back you in regards to the Offensive Behaviour Bill, but while you&rsquo;re sticking two fingers up to both the club and the authorities, they cannot possibly support you. Unfortunately the club has to play politics at time so why not make it easier for them to help you, be smarter on this and play the game.<br><br>Safe standing could solve a lot of this, but guess what? You&rsquo;re petty behaviour in 111 has screwed that up as well. After Hillsborough, safe standing will only ever be considered if fans can demonstrate they are able to follow the safety rules and guidelines. There is absolutely no way Celtic will be granted permission for a safe standing area when the fans that would be standing there have shown that they cannot behave themselves properly. Section 111 was a trial to show how much these type of areas could improve things at the games; but the fact that you&rsquo;ve shown (over and over again) you can&rsquo;t be trusted to follow the rules has given the authorities the perfect excuse to never allow safe standing areas. You&rsquo;ve screwed it for yourself as well as everybody else, so well done.<br><br>The GB are great at what they do (I actually love most of what you bring to the games) but you guys have to be clever here and do the sensible thing. Follow the rules, do what the club ask, save your section and make sure that everybody wins. Please don&rsquo;t let this &ldquo;to the last rebel&rdquo; mantra be the end of you. Being a rebel is meaningless if the cause isn&rsquo;t worthwhile and fighting against your own club is not worthwhile. The club is in a great position right now, our rivals have went bust and their clone is being tortured daily; everything is good and we really don&rsquo;t need divisions in our support. Do the sensible thing and remain a valuable part of the club.<br><br>I apologise for the length of this post but it&rsquo;s incredible to see something that brings so much enjoyment to the game be tossed away because people are being too immature and stubborn. I like you guys and have tried to defend you in the past but please, enough is enough. Time to grow up.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Green Brigade </h3>10 Aug 2013<br>On Monday we announced that the Green Brigade block within 111 was due to close at the behest of Celtic Football Club. Apparently under advice from the Safety Advisory Group of Glasgow City Council the Club arrived at the abrupt decision that they could no longer facilitate our section in the corner of Celtic Park.<br><br>After only one home game into the new season (v Cliftonville) the Green Brigade and those within our section were issued with an impromptu warning over our behaviour and threatened with bans. Given that there was little misconduct at this fixture the direct, confrontational approach from the Club took us by surprise. In the wake of this match an amicable meeting was held between Green Brigade and Club representatives, with dialogue being maintained almost daily since. Health and Safety concerns were and remain the source of dispute with the following issues being key:<br><br>- Overcrowding<br><br>While we accept that this is an issue needing addressed it is not the responsibility of the Green Brigade to enforce ticket checks and ensure fans are in the correct seat or area. This is the responsibility of the match-day stewards and ultimately the Club. While we will accept no blame in this regard we have, from the outset, done our utmost to help the situation. We have done so by discouraging the migration to our section both on our website, other websites and in person; while also co-operating with stewards on match-days with their ticket check routines.<br><br>- Moshing (mock fighting/jostling causing crowd disruption)<br><br>Despite the fact we regard this as a relatively harmless action and one which those participating in seemed to particularly enjoy, we did concede that it was unnecessary and causing unneeded and avoidable issues - particularly damage to seats. As such we agreed to refrain from doing this going forward and the Club were made aware of this intention.<br><br>- Body Surfing<br><br>Similarly to the above we felt that the safety concerns attached were being exaggerated. However, again we felt it necessary to drop this action given some of the risks attached and more importantly as a sign that we would not be stubborn and are open to co-operation and compromise. Once more, the Club were aware of our intention to stop this action.<br><br>- Broken Seating<br><br>The damage to seats within our section is one we cannot shy from nor deny. However we will not accept the Club lying or, at best, being disingenuous with the truth over their reporting of this issue. Given the energetic and boisterous style of support emanating from the section it is regrettable that there would be accidental, collateral damage to seats which aren&#39;t used and can get in the way. The insinuation from the Club though is that seats are damaged intentionally - not only is this not true but it is something which we would not tolerate. Additionally, we believe that the figures of broken seats spoken of have been deliberately manipulated in order to smear those in the section. The original numbers used seemed extremely exaggerated and we are confident that the claim of 35 seats being broken at the last game - when the one action which affected the seats most was dropped - is a complete fabrication. We have the following post-match footage which shows no clear sign of damage: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBpBv...A2tOKswod6PrUQ<br><br>- Bangers<br><br>The use of &#39;bangers&#39; at the Cliftonville match was regrettable and unwelcome. While our Group wasn&#39;t responsible for these being used we cannot shed the responsibility for them being used within our section. Despite accepting some responsibility we would like to state that since the formation of the section the Green Brigade have controlled ticketing therefore would be responsible for each individuals presence (unless migrated). This privilege was removed this season however which obviously dilutes our Groups accountability for those occupying the area. It could be said that this has also effected overcrowding. We have dealt with the matter of &#39;bangers&#39; to ensure that there is no repeat by warning the offenders and others from a repeat and the Club are aware of this.<br><br>- Lateral Movement<br><br>On the face of things, this rather trivial and harmless action appears to be the one sticking point which we find utterly ridiculous and difficult to comprehend. It is an action which occurs for no more than 2 minutes out of the 90 and one which we have yet to witness cause any injury or risk. Indeed, we have asked time and time again for the Club to provide us with an Accident report to prove us wrong in this regard yet none has been forthcoming.<br><br>If the concern here is the blocking of stairwells then we would like to make it clear that, in actual fact, the stairwells are not blocked in the manner that is being portrayed. As you can tell from the following video from the Ross County match ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k90i2...A2tOKswod6PrUQ ) for the most part most of the stairwell isn&#39;t actually blocked. Where it can become blocked is further back into the section where the issue of overcrowding is prevalent, therefore surely a product of the stewards/Clubs failings. Regardless, we question why straying onto a stairwell for seconds is deemed drastically unsafe while a congested staircase pre, during or post-match is not. We&#39;d also like to point out that 8 stewards stand in a fixed position on the stairwells either side of our section - 4 on each side - for the duration of the match thus causing a permanent blockage. The claim that this movement leads to an increased risk of falling and injury is ambiguous: so does an enthusiastic goal celebration and even the ever popular &#39;Huddle&#39; in the stands.<br><br>We believe that it is clear that there are efforts to not only sanitise our Group but supporters in general and we believe that this sanitisation will not stop with lateral movement. Accusations of sanitisation are fairly tame and not misplaced when you consider it wasn&#39;t so long ago that the Club were holding private meetings with other fan bodies where they smeared our group and section in a pathetic attempt of divide and conquer - events which were well documented at the time ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7yKQZaeSew ).<br><br>In summation it is clear that we have been fully co-operative with the Club. Since the Cliftonville match we have addressed the majority of the safety concerns outlined and eradicated three completely. One other is not our responsibility and the major issue of &#39;lateral movement&#39; we believe can be challenged in a constructive and sensible manner. When we last met with the Club (after the Cliftonville match) our thoughts on all issues were made clear and our position has not deviated since. As previously touched upon, the meeting was amicable and the Club in particular stated their satisfaction with the progression being made both in terms of dialogue re-commencing and with our efforts to address the aforementioned safety concerns. We therefore find it frustrating and disappointing that their attitude appears altered for an open forum.<br><br>The Green Brigade intends and hopes to be able to reach a positive outcome through dialogue with the Club and other necessary bodies. However, this will only be possible should the relevant parties believe that each other are being honest and forthright regarding the full circumstance and unfortunately doubts do remain. We were offered a copy of the dialogue between Celtic FC and the SAG however nothing has been provided yet. We hope that these documents, as well as submitted FOI requests, can provide all with a better understanding of the situation. We have already had informal correspondence with members of Glasgow City Council regarding this predicament and their well placed thoughts do not quite add up with Celtic FC&#39;s extraordinary decision and action.<br><br>We find it hard to believe that an institution as powerful and influential as Celtic FC finds itself backed into a corner over such a trivial issue with little scope for challenge. Should the Club believe that their hands are tied then we ask them to engage with their fan bodies in a bid to explore possible solutions as opposed to carelessly landing at unnecessary and provocative ultimatums. Considering the Club advised that they are still open to dialogue in hope of resolving the issue, we were surprised to learn that all season ticket holders have already been relocated and assigned alternative seats without warning nor consultation. The absurdity of this full episode is exemplified with one member being relocated to a different stand from his 4 year old son. The current Celtic hierarchy have an embarrassing track record when it comes to defending our Club and especially its fans. We stress to them that this does not need to be another example for the list and suggest that they re-assess the full situation whilst consulting the relevant parties.<br><br>Finally we&#39;d like to thank, as always, the Celtic support who have flooded us with positive sentiment and support. Once again we&#39;d like to stress to those within our section to refrain from any action until we have had the opportunity to discuss the situation fully and explore all possible options for moving forward.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic: the Green Brigade section is open again</h3>Gerry Braiden<br>The Herald<br>Friday 23 August 2013<br><br>Celtic today announced it was reversing its decision to close the section of Celtic Park which houses the controversial Green Brigade fans group.<br><br>The club had previously said it was was shutting Section 111, citing safety grounds such as &quot;lateral movement&quot; within the section, caused by the self-style ultras.<br><br>Other concerns related to overcrowding, the refusal of spectators to comply with stewards, mock fighting and body surfing of young people over the heads of spectators.<br><br>Last month, Uefa opened an investigation into the &quot;setting off of fireworks&quot; at the home European game against Irish club Cliftonville.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s decision comes just days before they face Shakter Karagandy in the home leg of a crucial Champions League qualifier, seeking to overturn a 2-0 reverse.<br><br>The Green Brigade have been credited in some quarters for helping engender a special atmosphere at Celtic Park.<br><br>The club&#39;s statement read: &quot;Celtic Football Club announced today that it has suspended the relocation of Season Books for supporters within Section 111 at Celtic Park.<br><br>&quot;Following extensive and positive discussions with supporters&#39; representatives for the Section, the Club has received assurances relating to previously raised safety concerns and unsafe behaviour within the stadium.<br><br>&quot;Celtic has engaged with the Glasgow City Council Safety Advisory Group regarding this matter and they have noted these assurances. This matter will be monitored on an ongoing, match -by-match, basis by both the Club and the Safety Advisory Group.<br><br>&quot;Celtic Football Club would like to re-iterate its commitment and responsibility to ensuring the safety of everyone who visits Celtic Park. It is our absolute priority.<br><br>&quot;The Club is pleased to have engaged in positive dialogue in relation to this matter. We thank the Safety Advisory Group and supporters&#39; representatives for their continued co-operation and we look forward to working together to ensure a safe environment in the stadium.&quot;<br><br>The Green Brigade said in a statement: &quot;The Green Brigade are pleased to announce that a positive outcome relating to Section 111 has been reached after constructive discussions with the Club. All relocations away from our block within Section 111 have now been reversed with all of those affected being returned to their original seat.<br><br>&quot;As always we must thank the Celtic support who once again rallied around our Group and section when it was needed. We would like to especially thank all fans within our block for their patience and resilience over the past few weeks as we tried to reach a positive conclusion.<br><br>&quot;We are now satisfied that this has been achieved and look forward to returning to Celtic Park on Saturday to resume normal practice. Furthermore we look forward to working together with the Club on a project to introduce a Safe Standing section to Celtic Park.<br><br><br>&quot;Given relocations have already taken place - and the late nature in arriving at this conclusion - current/original season tickets will no longer be active. For Saturday&#39;s match paper tickets will be issued for all within the block and will be distributed before the match. Tickets will be available for collection from 1pm at the ticket office behind the Superstore and will only be issued after presenting your 111 teamcard. We understand that this may be problematic however will strive to make the process as smooth as possible.&quot;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></div></div>
