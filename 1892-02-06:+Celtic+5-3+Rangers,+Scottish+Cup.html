There was a change in each  team. Madden was superseded by Cunningham in the Celtic team, and Law  took Hugh McCreadle&rsquo;s place in the Rangers. The Celtic started, and were  at once at the Rangers&rsquo; end. Henderson, of the Rangers, retired with a  sprained wrist before five minutes. The Celts were doing the pressing.  The Rangers&rsquo; got away on the right and left, and a foul to them gave  them a chance. Midfield play succeeded. Both goals were visited, but the  Celtic were most confident. Law got a fine chance for the Rangers, but  missed. In about a quarter of an hour Cunningham beat Haddow with a  beauty. Play was desperately fast for the ground, and not unequal. The  back play of Doyle was splendid. The Rangers were now showing splendid  attack, and keeping in their opponents they repeated their success. Out  of a scrimmage McMahon got a fourth. At the interval the result was :-  Celtic four goals; Rangers, nothing. The second half opened very much in  favour of the Rangers but after a chance or two the Celts took up the  aggressive, and before five minutes scored a shady goal, which was  allowed. The tide ebbed to the end, and before ten minutes Law scored  for the Rangers. The Rangers scored beautifully, but the referee  disallowed. The game was as brisk as ever, and ruled very even. The  Rangers has all the bad luck going. The Celts brightened up and put in  some sharp attacks, but they were not capped with success. Five minutes  before time the Rangers put on a third. The Rangers never lay down, and  their form was wonderful. Result:- Celtic, five goals; Rangers, three  goals.</div><div></div><div></div><div>.</div><div>The Scottish Referee - Monday 8th February 1892, page 1</div><div>.</div><div>Alas! Poor Rangers.</div><div>(BY DRAGON)</div><div>Alas! poor Rangers, again hope&#39;s strange smile,</div><div>Will o&#39; the wisp like, lures but to beguile;</div><div>Or, like fickle fortune&#39;s comet-like ray,</div><div>Flashes a moment - to vanish away.</div><div>Into the heart of the desperate fray,</div><div>The Light Blues dash&#39;d, eager to carry the day;</div><div>A forlorn hope - Celts stubborn and true,</div><div>Triumph&#39;d again o&#39;er the luckless Light Blue.</div><div>Honour their courage, endurance, and skill -</div><div>They fought to the bitter end wi&#39; a will -</div><div>Fought for the dear-lov&#39;d traditions of old</div><div>That, while mem&#39;ry lasts, they ever will hold.</div><div>Over the bill-tops of time there may break</div><div>A glorious dawn, which bright hope may awake.</div><div>Forward! Light Blues, play and practise the game,</div><div>And the laurels o&#39; vict&#39;ry will deck you in fame.</div><div></div><div>.</div><div>Celtic 5; Rangers 3. Yes, so it is, the hopes of the Light Blues have been once more unduly shattered, but still they live. Strengthened as they undoubtedly have been by the inclusion of Frank Watt in the team, and animated by their victory, a week ago, over Annbank, the Rangers were not without great expectations of being able to accomplish a hard task, that of defeating Celtic in the semi-final for the Scottish Cup at Parkhead, last Saturday. Between 10,000 and 12,000 spectators thronged the enclosure, and intense excitement prevailed all through the game. Rangers were the first to appear on the field, and shortly afterwards the Celts followed. H. M&#39;Creadie, owing to a slight injury, was absent from the Rangers ranks, his place being filled by Kerr; while Law, who has made a few promising appearances in the 1st XI already, played centre forward. Celtic were also handicapped by the absence, through indisposition, of Madden. Brady took his position in centre, and Cunningham - one of the reserves - partnered M&#39;Callum. Otherwise, the teams were as usual. Eager for the fray, the Celts, by quick close passing, got in front of Haddow; but Hodge, coming to the custodian&#39;s support, intercepted Campbell&#39;s shot, but at the expense of a profitless corner. Celtic pressed consistently, and with the exception of a few breaks-away, the Light Blues were uncomfortably pinned in during the first half. Watt could make little or no headway against the powerful defence of Dowds and Doyle, both of whom blocked, tackled, and charged him off the ball nearly every time he attempted to dribble past them. Henderson backed up as well as he could, but there was a lack of passing between him and his partner which contrasted very unfavourably with the</div><div>BRILLIANT CLOSE PASSING</div><div>of the opposing wing - M&#39;Mahon and Campbell. Law took some time ere he got into his stride, the fast work of the Celts apparently astonishing him greatly, but when he was wakened up he played wonderfully well, and managed to combine fairly well with the wings. M&#39;Pherson found W. Maley a hard man to get past, for though he performed all the &quot;tricks&quot; and resource he possesses, Maley stuck to him tenaciously, and beat M&#39;Pherson oftener than the latter apparently relished. At the interval, Celtic had 4 goals to 0 at their credit, M&#39;Mahon, Brady, M&#39;Callum, and Cunningham being mainly instrumental in having the points. Four goals down was enough to break the hearts of any team, but the Rangers, though somewhat put about, were far from disheartened, and started off at once by dashing daring work to bustle the Celts. For a time they succeeded in doing admirably, till at last the Celts, by capital close passing - like clockwork - meandered through the visitors&#39; defence, and Brady smartly shot a fifth goal. This seemed to rouse the Rangers blood, and drawing themselves together with the desperation begotten of despair, their vanguard flew like panthers down the field, and Law slashed on the</div><div>RANGERS&#39; FIRST GOAL</div><div>by a shot like a stone from a catapult. Again the Light Blues scored through Kerr, but the point was disallowed by Mr Referee Sneddon for offside. Playing in brilliant style the Light Blues now assumed the upper hand, and Henderson sent the Rangers supporters frantic with delight when, getting the ball right in front of Cullen, he beat him for the second time by a fast slanting shot. Celtic, apparently realising that the Rangers were gradually drawing upon them, put on a spurt, and M&#39;Mahon all but scored a sixth point, the ball glinting past the corner like a streak of lightning. But it was not to be, for, whether from apathy occasioned by a confidence that they had the game in their hands, or from lack of stamina, the play of the Celts fell off greatly, and the Rangers, taking advantage, scored a third goal, Kerr having the point from a pass by Henderson. The Rangers pluckily fought out the game to the bitter end. They gave a good account of themselves, and had they displayed the same dash in the first as in the second half the result might have been closer, but I don&#39;t think they could have won. The Celts have come through a capital &quot;trial,&quot; and it would not surprise me in the least to see them realise their highest hopes and obtain possession of the coveted trophy. I cannot refrain from complimenting the Light Blues on their magnificent endeavour to carry a forlorn hope, and with a parting wish for their - and all clubs&#39; - future good welfare and success I append my</div><div>OPINION OF THE PLAYERS</div><div>Cullen (goal), a young, but not a raw, recruit in Celtic ranks. He made a good name for himself in the Benburb, and is adding to his reputation every week as a rising custodian. He is agile, wiry, and wary, and saves well either with hands or feet. He compensates for his deficiency in height by his ability to jump and catch the ball. His inclusion has strengthened a hitherto comparatively weak spot in the Celts&#39; defence.</div><div>J. Reynolds (right back), a strong, powerful, but pacific, player; a capital header of the ball and a fearless tackler. Inclined to rush at, rather than wait on, an antagonist&#39;s approach. Weighty and watchful, he is a hard man to beat, and beats more than beats him.</div><div>D. Doyle (left back), a most judicious player, who never seems to lose his mental balance, and who by his cute tackling, powerful kicking, fertility of resource, and grand defensive powers is entitled to be classed as the foremost left back at the present moment in Scotland.</div><div>W. Maley (right half), Tall and sturdy, he knows the game, and plays it. He feeds the forwards well, and when occasion offers does not hesitate to shoot for goal himself.</div><div>J. Kelly (centre half), the most brilliant centre half in Scotland, and withal a very popular player. He scorns shady play, and invariably gives a finished exhibition of what half-back play should be. He dearly loves to have a dribble himself, and many a thrill of delight has passed through the spectators when Kelly, getting the ball at his toe, performed a dazzling run up the centre. He has played against England in the International three years - 1888, 1889, and 1890, and against Ireland once - 1886. The old Rentonian is still as good as ever, and his very presence seems to inspire confidence in the team.</div><div>Dowds (left half), a versatile player who can play any position on the field. His forte is at half, and here it is that his best worth manifests itself. He is good at overhead kicking, prompt, and energetic at tackling, and uses his weight when necessary.</div><div>N. M&#39;Callum (outside right), a cheery, good-hearted player, a fine dribbler, an accurate close passer, and a dead shot.</div><div>Brady (inside right), of medium height, but sturdily built - the late Everton man - knows every &quot;move on the board.&quot; He is a hard worker, a nimble dodger, and one of the finest close passers in the team.</div><div>Madden (centre forward), For his height and weight Madden is a wonder. He does not spare himself, but rushes into a man twice his weight. He delights in dodgy, short runs, knows how to pass, and never hesitates at goal.</div><div>M&#39;Mahon (inside left), A magnificent dribbler, hard to charge off the ball, and one of the best backers-up in Britain. He has scored more goals this season than any other man in the team, a fact that speaks volumes for his shooting abilities. He has not yet been &quot;capped,&quot; but may be this season.</div><div>Campbell (outside left), A good straight dribbler, a one screw kicker, and an accurate, quick close passer.</div><div>Haddow (goal). A custodian of parts, who seldom fails to shine conspicuously. The best goalkeeper the Light Blues have had since the palmy days of Gillespie.</div><div>Hodge (right back.) Though not in the front rank he is a wiry, lively player who works hard from start to finish.</div><div>T. Dunbar (left back), the late Celtic Reserve man, is rapidly coming to the front, and when the fiery energy of youth has been replaced (as it is to be hoped it will be) with judiciousness and resource young Dunbar may be found in the forward rank. He tackles well, but seems not to care where he kicks the ball so long as he gets it away.</div><div>R. W. Marshall (right half). A steady, determined player, full of quiet confidence in his own powers. Feeds his forwards well, and tackles and places with great judgement. A man worthy of any team who has not yet received a cap, although his sterling play well deserved one.</div><div>A. M&#39;Creadie (centre half). A pleasing, gentlemanly player. He lacks power, but is very smart, and when beaten never loses his temper.</div><div>D. Mitchell (left half). - One of the best, if not the best, left half-backs in Scotland. A man whose head controls his feet. A most able tackler, blocker, and placer, and a credit to Scotland. He played once against Ireland - 1890 - and may obtain greater honours this season.</div><div>Frank Watt (outside right). - Has had rather a roving career, but still maintains his form. He is a capital straight dribbler, an accurate, strong screw kick, and a powerful shot at goal. He played against England last year, and had the honour of scoring Scotland&#39;s only goal at black[sic] Blackburn.</div><div>Henderson (inside right) has a fault of some times dribbling back on his own goal instead of pushing forward or passing the ball. Still, he backs up well, and though not a brilliant player, plays the game as far as in him lies.</div><div>Kerr (centre forward). A pretty little dodger and dribbler, but rather defective in shooting power.</div><div>M&#39;Pherson (inside left), a most capable exponent of the dodging and dribbling game, but might with advantage to the team pass more to his brother forwards. He is speedy and resolute and a fair shot.</div><div>H. M&#39;Creadie (outside left), a fleet dribbler - sturdy on the ball, and quick and reliable at centring. He is well worthy his place and never loses his head. When minor honours are being distributed, the S. F. A. Committee</div><div>might do worse than bestow one upon Mr M&#39;Creadie.</div><div>THE ABOVE PLAYERS</div><div>have been regularly playing in the respective teams, but on Saturday, as will be observed, a change occurred in each team. These were -</div><div>J. Law, centre forward of Second Eleven Rangers, a light but clever little player, fair dodger and dribbler, and who has made several promising appearances in the first eleven this season already, and</div><div>Cunninghame[sic], the Celtic reserve, who played in Madden&#39;s place. He is a young, tricky player who ere long may find a prominent place in the ranks of the Celts.</div><div>-----------</div><div>Saturday&#39;s defeat adds one more to the rapidly-growing list sustained by the Light Blues in their encounters with the Celtic. With the exception of two drawn games, the Parkhead team has beaten the Rangers &quot;every time.&quot;</div><div>It is really wonderful the ill-luck which attends the Ibrox team on important occasions. On Saturday they had two goals disallowed, and all through the game they had all the hard lines that were going.</div><div>There can be no question about the superiority of the Celtic, but, all the same, with decent luck, the Light Blues ought, at least, to have drawn the game.</div><div>To Doyle, Kelly, Dowds, M&#39;Mahon, and Campbell the credit of the victory chiefly belongs. We have never witnessed a finer display than that given by the ex-Everton back, and consider him the best man in his position in Scotland.</div><div>M&#39;Mahon, in conjunction with Campbell, made the best wing on the field. When it is mentioned that M&#39;Mahon was in his most brilliant form, and that, besides scoring two goals, he had a hand in all the others, &quot;enough said.&quot;</div><div>M&#39;Callum and Cunningham were not a combination. The former missed his usual partner, and we think a mistake was made in not playing the same eleven as represented the club at Cambuslang on the previous Saturday.</div><div>Dowds and Maley, as they always do, came off against the Rangers, and by their speed and dash broke up many a promising run.</div><div>Two men stand out prominently in the Rangers ranks, and singularly enough, both are half-backs. Mitchell and M&#39;Creadie had no superiors in the game, and played grand football right up to the sound of the whistle.</div><div>It is an education to watch the play of D. Mitchell. For genuine work, artistic touches, which are seldom noticed by the spectators, and for generalship, he has no superior, if, indeed, he has an equal in all broad Scotland.</div><div>M&#39;Creadie&#39;s pluck and brilliant dash earned for him the good opinion of friend and foe alike. Kelly was good, but M&#39;Creadie was better.</div><div>Haddow, the Rangers&#39; keeper, played a splendid game, although he lost five goals. All points were scored with lightning shots; the wonder would have been had he managed to save any of them.</div><div>The forwards were all individually good, but the combination was far behind that of the Celtic. Kerr and M&#39;Pherson played well on the left wing, and Law stood up to the Celtic backs in game style. Frank Watt was not the Frank of old, but his partner, Henderson, was greatly to blame for this. Instead of drawing on the defence, and giving the International a clear run, a feature of play in which he excels, Henderson insisted on fancy dribbling and consequently lost the ball.</div><div>All the same Watt made little use of the chances he got, and it was only in the closing minutes of the game that he showed anything like form.</div><div>Considering the condition of the ground, the game was a great one, full of excitement from start to finish, and both teams are to be complimented on the entire absence of anything approaching unfair play.</div><div>The Rangers and Celtic have always been the best of friends. We feel confident that Saturday&#39;s game will increase the already good feeling existing between the clubs.</div><div>Good Ould Celts! Plucky Light Blues!</div><div>Should the Renton be fortunate enough to over throw the Queen&#39;s Park, it will be an interesting sight to see Kelly and N. M&#39;Callum playing against their old club.</div><div>The Celts are of opinion, however, that it will probably be the Queen&#39;s Park they will meet in the final; and if that be so, one of the greatest crowds will probably be seen at the game that ever viewed a football match.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><br></div></div>
