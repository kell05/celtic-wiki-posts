Celtic were on top throughout this game, and despite the Huns being able to break well at points, they were simply playing for penalties from early on. With injuries/resting players like Lafferty &amp; Jelavic, the Huns were relying on some rough tactics with heavy tackling on the menu. Luckily, Celtic&#39;s pressing on fairer referees has paid off with Murray officiating well and taking to half measures. He allowed around 20-25 mins before dishing out yellow cards, and Whittaker was first to be ordered off with two yellows. Harsh the first card may have been but it wasn&#39;t for that challenged alone (he had committed a few bad tackles before hand).<br><br>From then on, Celtic took control (in particular in the midfield) however we weren&#39;t makign enough of our advantages. Wilson was exceptional and has been on a bit of a goal glut of late (3 goals in 6 games) and he scored with his second chance today just after half-time to send the support into raptures. From then in, there was only one team in it. Rangers had a late burst but their runs were cut short..... and Rangers were out the cup!!!<br><br>YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>More important is the rammies that occurred. Diouf was in everyone&#39;s&#39; face, with match offs with Brown and then inexcusably with the Celtic bench. He should have been sent off early but the referee was too soft. Next there was a rammy with Mjallby for Djouf in the tunnel at half-time! It was comical.<br><br>The unbookable Bhougeira was sent off! Amazing! Daft tackles were the cause, he&#39;s scum like Diouf.<br><br>Diouf was sent off after the final whistle for not keeping control of his senses (not possible for him). A farce and scumbag. <br><br>The home support were in his face and we all laughed. The worse he is on the pitch, the worse his antics are...<br><br>Match ended with a spat between Lennon &amp; Ally McCoist (Hun assistant manager). McCoist approaced Lennon in our dugout, Lennon politley held out his hand, then McCoist whispered something in his ear, Lennon retorted, then it blew with some shoves and people jumping in to separate the two. McCoist should be hammered for it. (see <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8466520/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lennon v McCoist</a>).<br> <br>Anyhow, we won, it&#39;s great to be a Celtic.<br><br>Crazy: The match has been criticised by the First Minister as a disgrace with head police officer calling for possibly stopping all games v Rangers or play them behind close doors!

Old Firm clash turns nasty as Celtic beat Rangers </h3> <div class="float-r hidden">  </div>  By  <a class="external" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=y&authornamef=Stephen+Mcgowan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stephen Mcgowan</a><br> Daily Mail<br> Last updated at 1:26 AM on 3rd March 2011<br>  Even Stuart Pearce, old Psycho himself, must have wincedat this. Every disgraceful, snarling, furious minute of it. <br><br>As  another bone-rattling brute of an Old Firm game played out in acrimony  and ill-feeling, the former attack dog watched on. What he witnessed was  the kind of savagery and raw, naked aggression he once revelled in. But  on this occasion might have baulked at.<br><br>Together with Franco  Baldini, Fabio Capello&rsquo;s No 2, the England Under-21 coach travelled  north to assess Gary Hooper. Some hope. Some chance. There were times  last night when football was an incidental excuse for the release of  festering grievances.<br><br><br>Rangers travelled here in anger, their  pride bruised by the events of 10 days previous. In an Old Firm game,  any Old Firm game, anger is never far from the fore. <br><br>But this?  This was something else; something to prompt violence on the streets.  There was Ally McCoist and Neil Lennon, the figureheads for their clubs  next season, being hauled apart on the touchline at time-up. Three  Rangers red cards and a collective, complete loss of the plot. <br><br>Meeting  for the fifth time this season, stored resentments were played out,  studs left in, heads lost all over the pitch. A loss of responsibility  was the order of a night when personal vendettas were unleashed before  impressionable eyes. Even in the technical areas. Especially in the  technical areas.<br><br>The weekend witnessed Les Gray, chairman of the  Scottish Police Federation, call for the Old Firm game to be banned. It  was a statement met with much indignation and spluttering. Football,  they said, should never be used as a scapegoat for the social problems  of the west of Scotland.<br><br>Watching this through the cracks of his  fingers, however, the senior officer must have been tempted to march on  to the field, riot baton in hand. Let&rsquo;s not make light of the  situation. Somewhere last night, maybe more than once, animosity will  have spilled over with potentially dangerous consequences.<br><br><br>As  players and management from both sides saw red &mdash; literally in the case  of Steven Whittaker, Madjid Bougherra and El-Hadji Diouf &mdash; there was  little thought for the effects of some reckless, boorish, angry  behaviour.<br><br>It all began, predictably enough, with Diouf and Scott Brown. Anger-management sessions would barely cover these two. <br><br>After  relative calm 10 days ago, they were at it again, drawn to each other  like moths to light. Diouf raised a hand to the Celtic captain&rsquo;s face,  Brown mouthed back, referee Calum Murray had a word.<br>Rangers Madjid Bougherra<br><br>Double take: Madjid Bougherra tries to prevent referee Calum Murray showing him a second yellow card<br><br>Diouf  wasn&rsquo;t finished there. A man who can start a fight in an empty room,  the former Senegal international was hardly likely to miss the chance of  another set-to before 60,000 people.<br><br>Moments later, there was a  flare-up with Kris Commons and the first needless involvement of the  other players. The tempo was rising. And quickly.<br><br>When  Whittaker, almost playing as a second striker behind Diouf, clattered  into Ki Sung Yueng, there was little to it. Yet Whittaker, by then, had  been a persistent offender.<br><br>Like a domino effect, the first  booking triggered others. A reckless Daniel Majstorovic sliding tackle  on Diouf was unnecessary and crude, while John Fleck took out Mark  Wilson. Needless to say, Brown followed suit when he slid late into  David Weir.<br><br><br>The real aggro had yet to come, however.  Whittaker&rsquo;s foolishness in clattering into Emilio Izaguirre a mere five  minutes after his yellow card can hardly be equated.<br><br>Either way,  he had to go; Celtic&rsquo;s dugout triggering the fury of McCoist on the  other side by making their claims a little too vociferously.<br><br>As  Celtic&rsquo;s support rose in sound and fury, Whittaker took the long, slow  walk. Incandescent with the role of the Parkhead management team,  McCoist was pulled back from a square go with Alan Thompson by Walter  Smith.<br><br>True to form, there was no holding back Diouf. Charging  over to the technical area, the Rangers vigilante made to take on all  and sundry, fourth official Iain Brines trying manfully to act as  umpire.<br><br>As bodies charged over, Lennon, set to learn the fate of  his appeal against a six-game touchline ban this morning, unwisely  involved himself. <br><br>The blur of bodies of green and blue hues  surged around, jostling and shoving like the protagonists in a school  playground. The afters continued as Kyle Bartley, a no-nonsense figure,  showed his mettle by confronting Johan Mjallby at half-time in the  tunnel.<br><br><br>Then there was the furious figure of Bougherra,  trying to wrench the yellow card from Murray&rsquo;s hand after a late  challenge on Commons. He eventually walked and Diouf, a figure of  pop-eyed madness all night, followed for dissent on the final whistle.<br><br>Most  worrying of all was the sight of Lennon and McCoist, two intelligent,  articulate men, squaring up like no Old Firm managers have done before.  What, you wonder, would Jock Stein, Bill Struth, Willie Maley and the  late Tommy Burns, especially, have made of these scenes? <br><br>All  the while, the hard of thought stood in their pubs and sat in their  living rooms, glasses and cans in hand, fulminating. When the knifes  and sticks are brandished, some will say the blame can&rsquo;t be laid at the  doors of players and management at Celtic and Rangers. <br><br>Anyone  who believes this kind of nonsense has no bearing, however, would have  done well to spend the night in the casualty department of Glasgow Royal  Infirmary. Or field the phone calls of support to Gray this morning.  Now, more than ever, the man has a point.<br><br>Ironically, despite it  all, the only serious injury was football-related. It came from the  only piece of football all night, a blistering shot from Wilson laying  out the brave Sasa Papac on the goal-line. The Bosnian was removed from  the fray after the Celtic full-back had hooked the rebound into the net.<br><br>It  wasn&rsquo;t all nasty. In keeping with his mocking celebrations in the first  game, Brown offered a non-plussed Diouf a water bottle in the  unlikeliest olive branch of the year so far. After five meetings, the  time may have come for them all to have a drink. Preferably of the  non-alcoholic variety.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br><div class="headline"><h3>     Celtic 1-0 Rangers   </h3></div>                               <div class="bo">                                           </div>                                                                                                                          By Andy Campbell                                                                             <br>                                                                                                              <b>                            Rangers had three players sent off as they lost an ill-tempered Scottish Cup fifth-round replay against Celtic.                            </b>                            <br>                            Steven Whittaker was the first to go for a second booking after he fouled Emilio Izaguirre after 36 minutes.                             <br>                            Mark Wilson fired Celtic in front early in the second half and the visitors could not muster a response.                             <br>                            Madjid Bougherra got his second caution for a foul on Kris  Commons and El-Hadji Diouf&#39;s dissent meant a second caution for the  forward after full-time.                                            <div class="bo">                                                      Neil Lennon&#39;s side will now face Inverness Caledonian Thistle in  the quarter-finals and Celtic remain in contention to complete a  domestic treble, a feat now out of Rangers&#39;

John Fleck was also shown a yellow card as an  ill-tempered half drew to a close                             <br>                            But Ki still had time to send a free-kick narrowly over the visitors&#39;

I&#39;m  sure everyone will sit down and have a beer together.&quot;                             <br>                            Lennon elected not to speak to the media following the highly  controversial match, which saw Mark Wilson score Celtic&#39;s winner and  Rangers having two players sent off during the game and another after  the final whistle.                             <br>                            &quot;It&#39;s been well publicised about everything that&#39;s gone on and  (Lennon&#39;s) six-game ban pending, things he&#39;s said and things are flying  high at the end of the game in terms of tempers and he just thought it  was better if he left it tonight,&quot; said Thompson.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      There was also a touchline fracas at half-time, in which Celtic  assistant manager Johan Mjallby appeared to remonstrate with some of the  Rangers players as both sides came off the pitch.                             <br>                            &quot;I don&#39;t know, I was first up the tunnel so I didn&#39;t see that,&quot; said Thompson. &quot;I&#39;ve learned my lesson.&quot;                             <br>                            Of the game itself, Thompson praised the performance of Celtic, who remain in the hunt for a domestic treble.                             <br>                            &quot;We knew they&#39;d come and try and frustrate us, get behind the  ball,&quot; said the former Celtic player. &quot;We had an idea from how they  played in Lisbon last week, which got them a great result (against  Sporting). We knew they&#39;d frustrate us.                             <br>                            &quot;We tried to keep playing, we tried to play the right way.                             <br>                            &quot;I know people will say there were red cards and nine yellow  cards.

Lennon was banned for four games for the  same incident, although he didn&rsquo;t appeal against that. Rangers players  Madjid Bougherra and El-Hadji Diouf also escaped further suspensions  yesterday when the SFA disciplinary committee decided to only fine and  warn them.<br>That provoked an outspoken reaction from  McBride, who has successfully represented Lennon and Celtic in cases  against the SFA this season. &ldquo;The SFA are tonight officially the  laughing stock of world football,&rdquo; he told BBC Radio Scotland. &ldquo;And they  have been shown to be not merely dysfunctional and not merely dishonest  but biased, because McCoist &ndash; who undoubtedly said something that  provoked a reaction from Neil Lennon that caused a four-match ban for  him &ndash; has received no punishment. We know that Bougherra &ndash; who  manhandled the referee not once but twice &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t get a ban. We know  that El-Hadji Diouf &ndash; who was involved in an altercation in the tunnel  with a Celtic physiotherapist, refuses to leave the park when given a  red card and throws his top into the crowd against police advice &ndash; isn&rsquo;t  given a ban either. What is any sensible person to think of that set of  affairs?&rdquo;<br>It is understood that the SFA is ready to  consult its own lawyers about possible defamation of its disciplinary  committee members, who include Michael Johnston, the Kilmarnock  chairman, Stephen Thompson, the Dundee United chairman, and Scott  Struthers, the Hamilton Academical secretary. Celtic director Eric Riley  is also on the committee although he excused himself from the  decision-making because of his own club&rsquo;s involvement. Celtic could be  punished for questioning the integrity of the SFA if it is established  that McBride was speaking on the club&rsquo;s behalf. However, although he is  used by Celtic for their high profile legal cases, McBride has  previously stated he does not comment as an official club spokesman. He  has previously described the SFA as &ldquo;institutionally dysfunctional&rdquo;.<br>Lennon also expressed surprise about the  decision before last night&rsquo;s game at St Johnstone: &ldquo;I find it very  interesting that I am the only one that has served a ban from the  so-called shame game.&rdquo;<br>The view was different from the other side  of Glasgow. McCoist praised the SFA for its &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; after his  two-game ban was dropped at Hampden yesterday. Diouf, though, was fined  &pound;5000 and Bougherra &pound;2500 while both were warned about their future  conduct. It had been expected that both would be given additional  suspensions after being red carded on the game on March 2.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thrilled because I think common sense  has prevailed,&rdquo; said McCoist. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a bit of justice and I am  delighted. I looked at the case against me and the case we had to put  forward. We felt by using video evidence as well it was very, very  strong and thankfully that&rsquo;s the way it has turned out. My case for the  defence is I didn&rsquo;t commit the offence that was put against me, which I  stand by. Thankfully that&rsquo;s the way the committee have agreed and I&rsquo;m  delighted with it.<br>&quot;I am pleased that the SFA accepted what we  had to say on the matter. I don&rsquo;t believe I had a case to answer and I  am delighted with the outcome. As I have said before, what happened at  the game is in the past and we&rsquo;ve moved on. My focus now is the same as  our entire squad&rsquo;s &ndash; to win our remaining games in the league.&quot;<br>Martin Bain, Rangers&rsquo; chief executive, was  pleased by the outcome of McCoist&rsquo;s appeal but questioned the decision  to fine his players. &quot;We welcome the decision regarding Alistair and  this fully justifies our decision to appeal against the original  two-match touchline ban,&quot; said Bain. &quot;We have been fully supportive of  Alistair&rsquo;s position on this issue from the beginning and we&rsquo;re glad that  common sense has prevailed. &quot;We are however, disappointed that our  players&rsquo; misconduct was in the opinion of the disciplinary committee to  be of a significantly serious nature and we will study the reasons for  this when they are given in writing.&quot;<br><br><div class="article"><h3>     Embarrassing, against the rules and shameful <br></h3><h3>hugh macdonald 	    </h3><div class="comments-top">       <a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/celtic/embarrassing-against-the-rules-and-shameful-1.1096025#have-your-say" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="2011-03-02: Celtic 1-0 Rangers, Scottish Cup - The Celtic Wiki" class="icon-comments" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="2011-03-02: Celtic 1-0 Rangers, Scottish Cup - The Celtic Wiki"></a>     </div>     		13 Apr 2011 Herald<div class="article-body">                THERE are moments when the Scottish Football Association just takes the breath away.<br>There  was the one when a leading office-bearer described Celtic complaints as  &ldquo;tiresome&rdquo; when cases were under consideration. Two &ldquo;tiresome&rdquo;  complaints 	subsequently resulted in victory for Celtic, with Neil  Lennon&rsquo;s first ban for an incident at Tynecastle being deemed excessive  by an independent hearing. His second ban was against the association&rsquo;s  rules.<br>When a QC pointed this out, the  SFA took the huff, complaining of having to spend money on their QC to  defend the indefensible. A simple keek at the rule book might have saved  them, and our national game, money.<br>Then  we had the referee who gave Celtic a penalty, then rescinded it. Then  lied to the match observer and  to Neil Lennon. He was  given a warning  by an SFA committee before he had to be prised from his job.<br>Then  there was the referee who gave Rangers a penalty in an Old Firm match  while looking the other way. Then last night there was the official who,  from 10 yards, watched as Michael Duberry, presumably believing he had  been fouled, used both hands to control the ball on the ground. No  penalty.<br>There have been other major  instances of downright incompetence but all of  the above may charitably  ascribed to &ldquo;the pressure of the game&rdquo; by sympathisers. After watching  another referee give Rangers a penalty in a cup final then change his  mind and book a player for diving without recourse to further evidence,  my patience is exhausted. This referee  &ndash; Craig Thomson &ndash;incidentally  gave Celtic a penalty in an Old Firm game; unfortunately this occurred  24 hours after the final whistle.<br>The  decisions by the disciplinary committee of the SFA yesterday, though,  are the high point of the season in terms of absurdity. They are the  Monty Python sketch in the comedy that this nation&rsquo;s football has  become. They also fly in the face of the policy to support referees. <br>Whatever  one&rsquo;s view on yesterday&rsquo;s deliberations, it was not a show of support  for Calum Murray. One must wait for the ballot today when the referees,  presumably enraged at the leniency of the sentences, take to the picket  line. After all, Madjid Bougherra manhandled one of their members as he  was about to book him. And then he did it again. Bougherra was fined and  told not to do  it again. Presumably, the naughty step was being used.<br>Another  Rangers player, El-Hadji Diouf, bumped  into the Celtic physio, had a  slanging match with Lennon, who was banned for his behaviour, then would  not leave the field when advised to do so by the referee. He then  ignored the intervention of a police officer and threw his jersey into  the crowd. He was warned and fined.<br>Lennon,  who has served a ban for his part in incidents at Tynecastle and Celtic  Park, was on the touchline last night. He watched as Iain Brines  comically missed a penalty so obvious that the Celtic manager had to be  forced into humour. &ldquo;He just used the two hands,&rdquo; he said of Duberry&rsquo;s  intervention.<div>  </div> He was strictly serious when  addressing the sentences imposed on two Rangers players for, as the  charges had it, misconduct of a significantly serious nature and the  clearing of his counterpart Ally McCoist for their confrontation.<br>&ldquo;You  have to write it. I can&rsquo;t comment about a lot of things these days,&rdquo;  said Lennon. &ldquo;You have got to see it for what it is. If you have any  media integrity, you will call it as it is.&rdquo;<br>It is embarrassing, contrary to the interests of the game and to the rule of match officials, and shameful.                                 </div>   </div><br></div></div>
