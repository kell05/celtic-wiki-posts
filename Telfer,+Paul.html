Admittedly bought as a stop-gap player (i.e. he was over 35/experienced/old), he did end up playing a much greater role for the club than even we&#39;re sure the manager (WGS) or he himself believed he would.   <br><br>Having come from one of WGS&rsquo; prior clubs (Southampton), ridiculous rumours flew about as to just why Telfer was at Celtic (e.g. he was WGS&rsquo;s brother-in-law etc). Although, yes it is true he was relatively slow (he was in his 30s), but he wasn&rsquo;t as immobile as many made out. His performances were genuinely workman-like and never amazing, but his ability was never up their with the best and after the <a href="/page/2005-07-27%3A+Artmedia+Bratislava+5-0+Celtic%2C+Champions+League" target="_self">Artmedia debacle</a> (Celtic were knocked out of the Champs League in the qualifiers) he was too an easy target for many. <br><br>The financial fall-out from the Artmedia defeat meant Celtic couldn&rsquo;t replace him and he ended up having to play a far more regular role than anticipated, giving extra ammunition to the boo boys against WGS as well as himself.<br><br>Replaced by Mark Wilson in his second season in the defence, he ended up in a squad role, as anticipated by many for him. However, an injury to Wilson later on meant he was back in the first team, and excusing the first game v Man U away in the Champs league (where he was poor), he was solid and dependable and he seemed to grow on the fans with most getting off his back. Dependable is the appropriate word to describe him, and to everyone&rsquo;s surprise he ended up securing the right-back role for himself even once Wilson was fit again (a rare occurrence). <br><br>In many ways, playing for Celtic was something that he probably never expected in his career, having only ever played for uninspiring clubs. An article with him noted a conversation between Telfer and WGS:<br><br><blockquote><i>An old man, it should be emphasised, that the <a href="/page/Champions+League" target="_self">Champions League</a> has made very happy. Strachan also related a recent talk between the pair in a sauna. &ldquo;He was feeling his hip,&rdquo; says the manager, &ldquo;and I said, &lsquo;When did you do that?&rsquo; and he replied, &lsquo;Away to <a href="/page/Benfica" target="_self">Benfica</a> in the <a href="/page/Champions+League" target="_self">Champions League</a>&rsquo;, then he paused and said, &lsquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d utter that sentence in my life&rsquo;. It wasn&rsquo;t easy for him last summer with his family, but he didn&rsquo;t want this chance to go away. I think his wife will realise now that this was a chance he couldn&rsquo;t let go.&rdquo;</i><br></blockquote><br>The crowning achievement (for his career) was starting against AC Milan in the Champs League knock-out stages (Celtic had got through the group stages), and even though Celtic lost in extra time 1-0 after 180 mins of no goals in two legs, he gave a very good account of himself. The game was his last for Celtic, and he was at the age when his family was more of a concern than anything else and he decided to leave two months before the end of the season to be with them (his family didn&rsquo;t settle in Glasgow).<br><br>When Celtic won the league at the end of the season it was disappointing that he didn&#39;t return up north to join in the celebrations, but he likely wanted away to be with his family (plus he could be quite a grouch). He seemed to have an antipathy to football, reflected in a newspaper article where he was stated as an example of a sportsman who had fallen out of love with their sport. He never seemed to hide it too much, maybe he was just getting older or simply unappreciative of what he did have as a player. He later admitted in an interview that really golf was his first love, and that his managers had a problem in keeping him off the golf courses. <br><br>On the other hand, back in 1992, Paul Telfer and his then Luton teammate Darren Salton were involved in a horrific car crash. Telfer suffered only minor injuries and went on to make a full recovery, but Darren Salton almost died and was forced to quit football following the accident. After experiences like that, maybe you can understand or sympathise with his sometimes nonchalant attitude to football.<br><br>Not everyone&rsquo;s cult favourite player at the time but at the end of it all he gave a very good account of himself. Should have been better appreciated in his first season but hope the support made up for it in the second. <br><br>We wish him all the best for the future and hope he comes back to revisit the club.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td

target="_blank">http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/13413611.Paul_Telfer_reflects_on_nearly_landing_the_Inverness_job_when_he_was_pipped_by_John_Hughes/</a><br> </font><font color="#000000" face="Helvetica" size="3">19 Jun 2015<br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><br><font face="Helvetica"> THE scene is Tynecastle on New Year&#39;s Day, 2006.<br> A resuscitated Celtic side have just overcome a two-goal deficit to claim an enthralling win and breathe new life into their bid for the league title, extending their lead over Hearts to seven points. The balance of the match has been tipped by the weighty contribution of goalscorers Stephen Pearson and Stephen McManus, with the Celtic pair having since retreated to the dressing room without much fuss. <br> Neil Lennon does not get off so lightly. &quot;That was one of the most memorable games I&#39;ve ever played in . . . as we left the field there were fans trying to get at Neil Lennon. I&#39;d never seen so much hatred for a man,&quot; says Paul Telfer, right-back for Celtic that afternoon and a witness to the verbal attack on Lennon.<br><br> The voluble abuse given to his erstwhile team-mate has dissipated during the subsequent nine years and is replaced by the quiet conversation of patrons of the local Starbucks in the affluent Indiana suburb of Carmel where Telfer now finds himself. It is not an audience likely to be captivated by soccer stories, even those which include being part of a team received by football aristocracy in the San Siro, while also refusing to bow to Manchester United. <br> His time in Glasgow extended to 21 months but Telfer&#39;s career can more reasonably be measured by the scale of his experience. His achievements - he won two league championships and a League Cup during his time at Celtic Park, while he also competed in an FA Cup final with Southampton - shaped Telfer as a player to the extent that he almost took the form of a manager in the Highlands two years ago. <br> The former defender came close to filling the vacant post at Inverness Caledonian Thistle having been invited back to the Highland club for the final round of interviews, before missing out to John Hughes. Telfer retains an ambition to manage a club in the UK and is back on the lookout for a new challenge after leaving his position as assistant coach of North American Soccer League club Indy Eleven earlier this month. <br> <br> &quot;The people at Inverness were great when I spoke to them. They said it was down to two guys when I got asked back on the Sunday,&quot; says Telfer, who remains director of coaching at local youth club, Carmel FC. &quot;I was in the boardroom and was getting the feeling they were going to give me the job. I didn&#39;t know who the other candidate was but when I was walking out, Paul Hartley was walking in. I played with Paul with Celtic and thought he must be the other guy, then John Hughes got it. <br> &quot;That was really the first job I went to in management and the chairman said I was just lacking that little bit of experience. At Indy Eleven I felt like I was getting international experience, dealing with international agents, players from different cultures. My eyes have really been opened up wide. When I do get back to England or Scotland and try and get into management, I think this is only going to help me.&quot; <br> His arrival in the States has offered new insight into the work of a coach and is the fulfilment of an enduring ambition to work abroad. Telfer declined the offer of a one-year contract extension in his last season at Celtic to return to his family home in England, but he acknowledges his children have settled well in Indiana. <br> &quot;My son thinks he&#39;s James Bond - he&#39;s got an English accent and there are two girls knocking on the door every morning looking to walk him to school,&quot; he says. <br> A life across the Atlantic has taken been pleasing for Telfer, but he is still able to look back and pick out the enchanting details of his time spent in Glasgow with impressive accuracy. &quot;Shunsuke Nakamura is one of the best players I&#39;ve played with. You couldn&#39;t get a beachball off that guy,&quot; says Telfer, who shared a flank with the Japanese midfielder as he scored goals in successive meetings with Manchester United. <br> <br> &quot;After the game we won at our place [Sir Alex] Ferguson was going crazy at [goalkeeper Edwin] van der Sar, saying, &#39;I&#39;ll have to get you his DVD for Christmas. That is twice he&#39;s done you now&#39;. That boy.&quot; <br> And while the renowned hairdryer treatment of one manager was known to get results, it is not always constructive to raise one&#39;s voice, a lesson Telfer had earlier learned at Tynecastle.</font></font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><br></div></div>
