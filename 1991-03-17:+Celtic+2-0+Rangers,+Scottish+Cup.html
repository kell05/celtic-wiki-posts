Celtic also had a man dismissed on a day when the madness stole the thunder of their superiority over their bitterest rivals. Souness&#39;s woes were compounded with the injury to Trevor Steven, who was carried off after 11 minutes with cartilage trouble which has ended his season. The news that Steven requires surgery is a severe blow to England&#39;s manager Graham Taylor, who would almost certainly have fielded him against the Republic of Ireland in the European Championship qualifier a week on Wednesday.<br><br> It was Patrick&#39;s Day in Paradise for Celtic&#39;s faithful but the old saint would surely have had plenty to say about the behaviour. &#39;I want to apologise on behalf of my team for their lack of discipline,&#39; said Souness. &#39;I did not believe them capable of such a performance, either football-wise or in terms of indiscipline. Celtic deserved to win. We play them again in the League next week and some of my players will have to take a close look at themselves.&#39;  <br><div><br> The Ibrox side, who last won the Cup in 1981, were outplayed before the mayhem began. They may have come from behind to win the ordering-off contest, but never looked likely to pull back Creaney&#39;s and Wdowczyk&#39;s first-half goals.</div><br><div>Celtic&#39;s Grant was the first to be dismissed, for a tame piece of silliness, but Rangers came back strongly with Hurlock, Walters and Hateley receiving red cards for physical delinquency. The Celtic midfielder was first booked for nudging Johnston off the ball as the Rangers striker tried to steady himself just outside the penalty area for a shot at Bonner&#39;s goal. Seconds later, as the free-kick was being taken, Grant broke from the wall and charged the ball. The referee deemed it cautionable and the player left dejectedly in the 54th minute.</div>  <div><br> Hurlock lasted a further 10 minutes before being dismissed for punching Coyne. Walters, in a demonstration of rare foolishness, later had two swipes at Coyne with his foot before finally landing an elbow on him with the ball elsewhere.</div>  <div><br> Hateley, who had already been cautioned for a foul on Creaney, was later dismissed for a rough tackle on Rogan, who was booked for pushing the Rangers striker away.<br><br> The sweetest parts of the game were all contained in that first half. It took a marauding Celtic only six minutes to take the lead with a superb goal from Creaney, who ran on to a header from Coyne and sent a fierce 15-yard volley past Woods.</div>  <div><br> Wdowczyk&#39;s ferocious 35-yard free-kick was deflected into the roof of Woods&#39;s net amid suggestions of an own goal. But that would be unfair on the Polish defender, whose drive deserved a goal. It was, despite the closeness of the score, Celtic&#39;s most comprehensive victory over Rangers since Souness&#39;s arrival in 1986.</div><br><br><b>  </b><div></div><b>  <div></div>  </b><div><h3>The Independent (London) March19, 1991, Tuesday Football: Parkhead four escape action</h3><b> </b><br> BYLINE:By DON LINDSAY</div><br><div>SPORT PAGE; Page 32<br><br> IT now seems unlikely that legal action will be taken against any of the participants in Sunday&#39;s explosive Scottish Cup tie between Celtic and Rangers in which four players were ordered off. A spokesman for the procurator fiscal in Glasgow said last night that no police report had been received in connection with the conduct of either the three Rangers men or the solitary Celtic player who were dismissed by referee Andrew Waddell.&#39;&#39;We have not had a police report, and as far as we are aware none is being prepared. There has also been no complaint from any member of the public,&#39;&#39; the spokesman said.<br><br> Terry Hurlock, Mark Walters and Mark Hateley of Rangers, as well as Celtic&#39;s Peter Grant, were all sent off in the course of a 30- minute spell during the second half of the quarter-final match, which Celtic won 2-0.After a similarly volatile Old Firm match in 1987 in which three men were ordered off, Chris Woods and Terry Butcher of Rangers were found guilty of breach of the peace, while Graham Roberts was found not proven and Frank McAvennie of Celtic not guilty.</div>  <div><br> Further controversy surrounds an apparent altercation between Graeme Souness, the Rangers&#39; manager, and his striker Ally McCoist, who was surprisingly dropped for the match. It seems that Souness took exception to McCoist going to the Cheltenham racing festival on a day off last week, and reacted by leaving the Scotland forward out of his squad.</div>  <div><br> No comments were forthcoming from Ibrox on either the McCoist matter or the club&#39;s plans to fine Sunday&#39;s miscreants, except to say that the latter was a situation governed by Rangers&#39; internal disciplinary system.</div>  <div><br> The draw for the Cup semi-finals has paired Celtic with the winner of tonight&#39;s replay at Cappielow Park between Morton and Motherwell. That tie will take place at Hampden Park on Wednesday 3 April, with the other match between Dundee United and St Johnstone going ahead at East End Park, Dunfermline, the following Saturday.</div></div>The Times<br>March18, 1991, Monday<br>Four sent off asCelticwin<br><br>BYLINE:By Roddy Forsyth<br><br>THREE  players fromRangersand one fromCelticwere sent off before the home team  completed its 2-0 win in an acrimonious Scottish Cup quarter-final at  Parkhead yesterday.Rangersfinished without Terry Hurlock, Mark Walters  and Mark Hateley.

It&#39;d been  dangerously close to a professional foul but things weren&#39;t quite as  strict back then and he&#39;d got away with it.  We breathed a sigh of  relief, only for the idiot to charge down the free kick and get himself  sent off anyway.<br><br>Aside from that, what a great week.  It was so  rare to have live football back then so to have two humpings of the hun  in back to back weeks was truly special.  We were quite good at giving  ourselves hope during the 90s.  These games were followed by a brutal  semi final defeat against Motherwell after a replay.  I was at the first  semi v Motherwell.  0-0 in the pissing rain at Hampden.  Utterly  miserable, although I do remember the noise the Celtic fans made at one  point was up there with anything I&#39;ve ever heard.<br><br>One year later a  cracking 2-0 win at Ibrox was followed by the most painful game of them  all - the semi defeat to the huns.  The game in which we hit the  woodwork three times, were denied the single clearest penalty I&#39;ve ever  saw and played against 10 men for 85 minutes yet still managed to lose.   And it was pissing with rain.  <br><br>In the 93-94 season (yes - the  Macari years) we actually had the cheek to be in the title race at  Christmas.  Only a point or so behind, we were on a role having beat the  huns at Ibrox and were all set to beat them at CP and genuinely  challenge.  Cue being 3-0 down and chaos ensuing (although, even then,  we nearly got back into the match).<br><br>Routinely, just as it looked  like we were going to turn the corner, it&#39;d turn out that we&#39;d actually  stumbled blindly into a dimly lit alley populated by big hairy rapists  who&#39;d procede to roger us so badly we&#39;d be crying for weeks afterwards  whilst mumbling incoherently about the unfairness of it all and  lamenting the lack of any decent, reasonable and compassionate God. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  (Silent Witness of KDS forum)</h3>That was my going to nearly all the hun games season. <br><br>First game  at Ibrox in Sept &#39;90, we were murdered 1-1. They missed chance after  chance only for Whyte to score with a terrific header. <br><br>Then it  was the League Cup Final in October, when for the 1st hour we were  actually the better team. The Cesar took off Joe Miller for Chris  Morris, the huns upped the pace and ground out the win. <br><br>Missed the 2-1 defeat in November at CP. <br><br>But  went to the New Year game at Ibrox - it was very easy to get a ticket.  Finished 2-0 to the huns and they did in cruise mode. It put us on  something like 17 points after 20 games and they sang &quot;Relegation&quot; to us  at the end. <br><br>By the time the Cup game came along we were  actually on a wee run of form. Not exactly playing well, but they were  grinding out results and we caught the huns at exactly the right time.  They&#39;d just lost to Aberdeen (quality team that season) and it was all  just starting to unravel with Souness. Creaney&#39;s goal apart, I don&#39;t  recollect a great deal of football being played. Tommy Coyne did a great  job of winding up their players and for some reason, their collective  fuses went. The following week, though, we were flattered to win 3-0,  but it was enough to send them into meltdown. If Souness had not left,  they would have lost that league (almost did anyway).<br><br>I was then  at the first huns game during the following season and the difference  with them was like night and day. The absolutely murdered us 2-0 with  Hateley in particular running all over our defence. False dawns indeed.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> Scottish Cup Memories &ndash; The St. Patrick&rsquo;s DayMassacre<div class="post-info">January 19, 2017 </div><br><br>Source: <a href="https://ntvceltic.wordpress.com/2017/01/19/scottish-cup-memories-the-st-patricks-day-massacre/" target="_self">https://ntvceltic.wordpress.com/2017/01/19/scottish-cup-memories-the-st-patricks-day-massacre/</a><br><br>Scottish Cup 3rd round, 1991, and there we were in Forfar, up to our armpits in bridies muttering, &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we been here before??&rdquo; It wasn&rsquo;t the only similarity we would encounter on this cup run.<br>Happily Forfar didn&rsquo;t cause any problems this time round and an easy 2:0 victory was recorded. The main talking point after the game was the Forfar fans&rsquo; (or should that be &ldquo;fan&rsquo;s&rdquo;?) constant chanting of Terry Hurlock&rsquo;s name. Rather than admitting to being Huns without the bus fares the locals would doubtless claim that they were just winding us up. Aye right!<br>St. Mirren were the opponents in the fourth round (a young Paul Lambert featured on the bench). The tie was moved to a midweek slot to accommodate TV &ndash; a rare event in Scotland at the time &ndash; and first half goals from Coyne, Miller and an o.g. from McWhirter were enough to see Celtic through safely to the last eight.<br>So, the quarter final draw, and more deja vu as the audible gasps together with the thud of SFA officials hitting the deck in fainting fits could only mean one thing; the big Glasgow teams had to play each other in an early round for the second season in a row.<br>Rangers, at Celtic Park, with the tie due to be played on St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day no less.<br>The build up to this one was naturally very subdued with no one being too bothered about who was going to win&hellip; Oh all right. Everyone was going mental!<br>Not only was our season on the line again, but Rangers were going for the treble. Celtic were due to play them twice in two weeks and recent form suggested that the Hoops were in for a hefty beating &ndash; in some cases quite literally.<br>The more superstitious among us were dismayed to find out that Celtic&rsquo;s lucky mascot in the Scottish Cup, Chris Morris, was injured. He&rsquo;d never lost a game in this competition in regulation play. The more football minded among us were dismayed because this meant that Mark McNally might be involved. In the event the more experienced Grant was picked in defence.<br>If there was any hope to cling on to it was the fact that Rangers hadn&rsquo;t won a cup tie against the Hoops at Celtic Park since 1905. They also had Scott Nisbet playing in defence.<br>The game itself started in an unusually quiet manner, both teams dispensing with the traditional early practice of blootering the ball &ndash; or the nearest opponent &ndash; as far as possible in the direction one happened to be facing at the time. But it wasn&rsquo;t long before the shrill tone of the referee&rsquo;s whistle was announcing the first episode of that afternoon&rsquo;s foulfest as Walters got to show off his silky skills by dextrously clattering Joe Miller into the stand.<br>Andrew Waddell was that day&rsquo;s man in black. A pathologist by profession, he was officiating his first Glasgow derby and was about to witness some pretty pathological behaviour from Souness&rsquo;s stiffs.<br>Six minutes in, Celtic took the lead when Wdowczyck lofted a free kick to the far side of the Rangers penalty area. Gough was odds-on favourite to get it but his former Dundee United team mate Coyne got the vital nod. The ball broke to Gerry Creaney who managed to blast a shot past Woods and into the corner of the net. It was one of the best goals he ever scored for Celtic and truly typical of the player. Give him an impossible angle and an awkward bouncing ball and he&rsquo;d fire it in almost every time; give him a one-on-one with the &lsquo;keeper and he&rsquo;d fall on his arse.<br>Rangers were not impressed by this unexpected turn of events and came roaring back. Bonner had to come for several dangerous crosses and Trevor Steven saw a header float just wide.<br>Things took a turn for the worse for the silenced blue hordes shortly after that. Steven, the man Rangers looked to in midfield, caught his studs in the turf while attempting to foul Joe Miller, who was having a rare afternoon of good form on the right wing.<br>Steven was carried off to a sympathetic chorus of &ldquo;Dig a hole and bury him&rdquo; from the Jungle. On the way up the tunnel he passed assistant manager Walter Smith who was sporting a ghastly blue shell suit and white trainers ensemble that made him look like a pensioner who had been adopted by the Aberdeen casuals as a lucky mascot. His loss took the creative thrust from Rangers and Celtic, with McStay in top form, took control of this crucial area.<br>The answer from Souness was to trundle Big Bertha out and begin the aerial bombardment. The contrast in forward lines took on a familiar look. Predating Blackburn&rsquo;s SAS (Sutton and Shearer) Celtic were fielding the MCC (Miller, Coyne and Creaney. Rangers were relying on the HUB (Hateley&rsquo;s an Ugly Bastard).<br>In truth the game was one for the Doug Baillie raw meat enthusiasts rather than admirers of the Dutch national team, due largely to the interminable stoppages for fouls and injuries, but just before half-time Celtic got another break. With the clock ticking down to the interval Celtic were awarded a foul after Hurlock &ndash; the kind of player that often had opponents reaching for the garlic and crucifix &ndash; had grounded Creaney for the umpteenth time.<br>The kick was dead centre of the pitch but a good 35 yards from the goal. It seemed obvious that Wdowczyck would float it into the box just as he had earlier in the game. Not a bit of it.<br>The distance he took for his run up would have done justice to a fully laden Jumbo jet on the runway at Glasgow Airport. Starting from just outside the centre circle he raced up a leathered the ball with everything he could muster. Instinctively, Hurlock put out a leg which succeeded in sending it in a majestic arc over Woods and into the net.<br>Celtic Park went into full-on berserk mode. Poetic justice had been meted out to a player who should never have been allowed out onto the same pitch as the likes of McStay and Collins.<br>Hostilities paused briefly when Maurice Johnston, who until this point had given us very few chances to hurl abuse in his direction, slithered his own way into Waddell&rsquo;s notebook for dissent, which matched his descent the year before.<br>As the half-time whistle blew we could scarcely believe what was happening.<br> The second half started with Rangers playing in predictably determined fashion (wouldn&rsquo;t you be determined if you had to pick bits of tea cup out of your head following a Souness rant?) and after a torrid eight minutes Johnston was put through on goal only to be hauled back by Grant. Referee Andrew Waddel, not a renowned Celtic sympathiser, duly awarded the free kick but let Grant off with a yellow card, judging that Elliott was the last man rather than Pointy Pete.<br>It looked like being a vital break until Grant lined up in the defensive wall for the resultant set piece before charging at the ball like someone rehearsing for Pamplona. It was another bookable offence and he was promptly dismissed.<br>Calamity.<br>Rangers squandered a number of chances in the following ten minutes, most notably a sclaff by Huistra from ten yards out, before Celtic steadied. Paul Elliott typified Celtic&rsquo;s attitude on the day when he stopped a Ferguson shot with his face and slumped to the deck spitting out teeth, blood and the remains of his half-time pie and bovril. A rub down with Brian Scott&rsquo;s magic sponge and he was back on the pitch a few minutes later looking for Soapy with an ominous glint in his eye.<br>Then the real fun started. Tommy Coyne, dropping back to help his beleaguered team mates, clipped Hurlock, who clearly didn&rsquo;t subscribe to the old adage that if you dish it out you should be prepared to take it. He lashed out at Coyne with his elbow &ndash; he was approximately three feet away from the referee at this point &ndash; and got a straight red for violent conduct. Incredibly, he hadn&rsquo;t even been booked until then.<br>At which point the roof fell in on Rangers and their players seemed to lose whatever sense of self-discipline they had.<br>If Hurlock had been contemplating a quiet fifteen minutes in the bath playing with his rubber duck he was in for a surprise. Coyne was involved in the next incident as well. He tackled Walters and won the ball. The Rangers winger, who had been well shackled by an unusually sure-footed Anton Rogan, had two good attempts at removing der Bomber&rsquo;s kneecaps before finally settling for a well placed elbow in the teeth. Walters had been booked for yet another foul on Coyne in the first half, but there was to be no second yellow. Once again it was a straight red.<br>Next to go was Hateley, at that time almost as much of a hate figure among the Rangers supporters as he was with us. He got himself involved in a handbags sketch with Rogan. Both were shown yellow cards but as it was Hateley&rsquo;s second he too took the long walk towards what was becoming a busy Rangers early bath tub.<br>With their opponents reduced to eight players Celtic threatened to run riot but unfortunately Creaney was unable to convert two great chances; a header from six yards or a one-on-one with Woods. It would have been a memorable hat-trick.<br>However, spirits weren&rsquo;t dampened in the slightest. A famous victory had been achieved, one that we imagined would surely give Celtic the heart to march on and claim the Scottish Cup for the third time in four years. (1)<br>As if to emphasise the turning of the corner the Hoops won against Rangers again a week later, this time by the even more convincing margin of 3:0 in a match that was also shown live on TV.<br>In anticipation of Rangers being unable to drastically alter their style of play NTV gave out 6,000 red cards to be waved at offenders.<br>Nesbit duly obliged.<br>It was the last time Celtic faced a Rangers team managed by Graeme Souness, or as one of his players affectionately called him, The Beast (copyright Jan Bartram 1988). He walked out on them shortly afterwards to take charge of Liverpool after Kenny Dalglish decided he&rsquo;d had enough.<br><br><br><br></div></div>
