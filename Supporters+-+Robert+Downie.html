However he earns his highly worthy place in Celtic annals through his connection with the club, firstly as a great supporter of the club, as an employee of the club working as a cashier on the turnstiles (post-war), and for his service during the First World War where he served gallantly for his people and country, earning the Military Medal and Victoria Cross (the highest military medal awarded for valour).<br> <b><br></b><b>Forces</b><br>SGT Robert Downie VC MM was born on the 12th of January 1894 to Irish parents from Laurencetown, County Down. One of sixteen children he was educated at St. Aloysius Catholic, Springburn, Glasgow. He joined the army at 19 and was a regular with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers at the start of the first world war. He was awarded a Military Medal, and then a Victoria Cross (the highest honour).<br><br>He was a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Dublin Fusiliers, British Army during the First World War when the following deed took place during the Battle of the Somme, for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross for exceptional bravery. <br><br>On 23 October 1916 east of Lesboeufs, France, when most of the officers had become casualties, Sergeant Downie, utterly regardless of personal danger and under very heavy fire, organised the attack which had been temporarily checked. At the critical moment he rushed forward shouting &quot;<i>Come on the Dubs!</i>&quot; which had an immediate response and the line rushed forward at this call. Sergeant Downie accounted for several of the enemy and in addition captured a machine-gun, killing the team. Although wounded early in the fight, he remained with his company, giving valuable assistance while the position was being consolidated. <br><br>On his homecoming, he arrived at Glasgow Central Station to be met by hundreds of people who carried him shoulder-high to a taxi. Springburn Road was decorated with flags and bunting and lined with hundreds more people, and his achievement was widely reported in the Glasgow press.<br>  <b><br></b><b>Post-War </b><br>He lived quietly in Carleston Street, Springburn, until his death in 1968. A modest man, he often played down his bravery, saying he won the medals for having &#39;shot the cook&#39;.   <br><br>A Celtic fan through and through, football fans at Celtic Park regularly saw him on a Saturday as he worked as a cashier at the turnstiles. <br><br>Downie passed away in 1968, and has a grave/memorial at St. Kentigern&#39;s Cemetery, Glasgow, Scotland (Section 21, Lair 506, with headstone).<br><br>His Victoria Cross medal remains with the family who still have the medal.<br><br>In 2016, he was honoured with a remembrance stone at the People&#39;s Palace, a highly deserved honour.<br><br>A very notable Celtic supporter of whom we should all be very proud to be able to number as one of our own.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Downie%2C+Robert+-+Grave" target="_self">Grave &amp; Memorial</a></li></ul>  <h3>  Links</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/World+War+One" target="_self">Celtic &amp; World War One</a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><img align="bottom" alt="WW2 - Sergeant Robert Downie - Kerrydale Street" height="576" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/y9IAf4UAdQF3s4KTHDHpcg39477/GW392H576" title="WW2 - Sergeant Robert Downie - Kerrydale Street" width="392"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Supporters - Robert Downie - The Celtic Wiki" height="273" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/66e8b7a60207ba6a2da4860d2f487510/GW400H273" title="Supporters - Robert Downie - The Celtic Wiki" width="400"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Supporters - Robert Downie - The Celtic Wiki" height="313" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/897e0b27d4f136db9329f635631da28c/GW222H313" title="Supporters - Robert Downie - The Celtic Wiki" width="222"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Supporters - Robert Downie - The Celtic Wiki" height="397" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/114a1f88201c4f209d0e8c04663353c7/GW222H397" title="Supporters - Robert Downie - The Celtic Wiki" width="222"><br><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Downie, Robert - Pic" height="1242" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/4tKQGqlGjThSZHdbJWQbDQ1021489/GW902H1242" title="Downie, Robert - Pic" width="902"><br><br><h3>Painting of Robert Downie held at Celtic Park<br></h3>This is a photo of an oil painting held in the Celtic store.

Like two brothers and his father, he worked in Hydepark Locomotive Works, Springburn<br>. <br>Possibly inspired by his eldest brother, a sergeant in The Royal Scots Fusiliers, Downie joined the army in 1912, aged 18.

The Fusiliers fought at Aisne, Messines and Ypres, enduring hard fighting on the Western Front from the outset, and Downie suffered the effects of a gas-attack. He had already received the Military Medal for bravery, when he such showed outstanding courage on 23 October 1916, the 115th day of the First Battle of the Somme. Gen Haig&#39;s report on <br>advances round Les Boeufs and Morval: &#39;Constant rain turned a mass of hastily dug trenches ... into channels of deep mud ... roads broken by countless shell-craters ... became almost impassable&#39;. This meant no further supplies of ammunition reached the exhausted troops, and it became &#39;an easier matter to take a battered trench than to hold it&#39;.

Downie never spoke about the day to anyone again, not even his own family.&#39; The objective was a fortified, strategically-important German machinegun position east of Lesboeufs called &#39;Gun Pits&#39;, which had resisted capture, and after the 2nd Battalion went &#39;over the top&#39; at 2.30pm, they were machine-gunned at close range, and some crawled back to safety.

The German fought like a beast at bay ... actual hand to hand fighting ... Considering the carnage that ensued, we got ... light casualties.&#39; In this tactical emergency, Jeffreys explained &#39;The dead Hun was appalling. I gave orders that no prisoners were to be taken ... in case of a counter attack and it takes too many men away to send escorts to the rear with them ... so you can imagine what happened with the bayonet&#39;.

Gun Pits, a well-fortified German machine gun  post east of Les Boeufs, had hammered at soldiers of the 4th division  including the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. With his officers and comrades cut  down around him, Glasgow-born Sergeant Robert Downie issued a battle  cry &quot;Come on, the Dubs&quot; and charged against the murderous guns.Downie,  one of 13 children of an Irish father and Dundee-born mother, had  worked alongside his father and two brothers in the Hydepark Locomotive  Works in Springburn until his 18th birthday, when he joined the Irish  regiment of the British army in 1912. When war broke out Downie, already  married, was sent to France with his regiment and saw heavy fighting  from the start of the campaign on the Western Front. He had already  suffered in a gas attack and had been awarded the Military Medal when he  showed the outstanding courage that earned him the VC on 23 October,  1916, the 115th day of the First Battle of the Somme.Hundreds Cut DownHours  of bloody hand-to-hand fighting for the strategically important  position had left the Irish troops exhausted and severely depleted: five  officers and 124 men were wounded and 36 were missing. The fusiliers  went over the top at 2.30pm, but hundreds were cut down at close range.  Survivors crawled back through the mud to their dug-outs.Orders  were given to take no German prisoners and bayonets were fixed. Again  and again, the Germans defended their line. One officer described them  as &quot;beasts at bay&quot; counter-attacking and pinning the Dublin Fusiliers  into hastily dug mud-filled trenches. Battle Cry Rallies MenWith  the last officer dead, Downie took command. He rallied the troops under  heavy fire and rushed forward alone, issuing his battle cry. Inspired,  the exhausted men joined the charge. Downie killed several Germans and  took the machine gun, killing the team which had inflicted so much  suffering on his comrades. Alongside the wounded and missing, the Gun  Pits crew had claimed the lives of three officers and 14 men. Downie was  wounded, but the gun position was finally taken. It was a day so bloody  that Downie never spoke of it to anyone again, not even in his own  family.A professional soldier, Downie had once joked with friends  about bringing home the VC. After he was awarded the honour, he told  the press: &quot;Every man in the regiment won the VC that day&quot;.Downie  arrived home to Carleston Street, Springburn on Hogmanay 1916. From  that one street, over 200 had joined the army. Sixteen had been killed  and five had lost limbs. He was presented to the City Council and  attended a public reception at Springburn Public Halls. He was feted by  St Aloysius Church and School, and local dignitaries. Two of  Downie&#39;s brothers, David and Richard, who had welcomed him home, died in  France in 1917. After the war Robert Downie VC became a groundsman and  turnstile cashier at Celtic Football Club.
