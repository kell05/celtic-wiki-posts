It&rsquo;s true that Celtic weren&rsquo;t great on the pitch, but this is a club with a great history. I have a lot of respect for them and their supporters. It was a beautiful evening.&rdquo;<br>Nasser Al-Khelaifi (PSG billionaire owner after Celtic v PSG game, Sep 2017)<br><br>(SAmule of KDS)<br>First off, PSG are a really good team.  At times it looked like they had 15 players on the pitch last night; they always seemed to have an extra man to close in on our players, or in space to pass to when we closed in on them.  They played football the way Brendan Rodgers wants us to play football, but obviously that level is easier achieved when you have unlimited spending power in a big market than when you&#39;re playing in a backward league run by idiots.<br><br>It&#39;s hard to know precisely how much of our poor performance was forced on us by them being so good - you have to be fair to both sets of players and acknowledge that their superior ability must have been a significant factor - but it was clear that we didn&#39;t help ourselves at times.  I love Roberts and Sinclair, but last night was like harking back to the Strachan years where the sole tactic was give it to Nakamura or Maloney/McGeady and hope they can do something good.  We had absolutely nothing through the middle, and no variety to our play.<br><br>And worst of all was the fact that we appeared to be star-struck, again.  How many effing times does this have to happen?  Most of those guys have played European football for us and international football for their countries, they shouldn&#39;t be gawping at the big names in the opposing side.  I understand that you have to be a bit more wary of Edinson Cavani than you do of Kris Boyd, but that doesn&#39;t mean you can forget how to control a ball just because he&#39;s stood a few yards away from you. <br><br>(Markybhoy of KDS)<br>I&#39;m sorry but that just wasn&#39;t acceptable to me. Getting beat by a team with those players isn&#39;t shameful, playing like that at home and losing so abjectly is. <br><br>Whether that attitude is labelled as unrealistic is of absolutely no interest to me. Anderlecht went to Munich, went down to 10 men and then only shipped another 2 goals. They will be feeling very positive about their chances of finishing 3rd after watching our rabbit in the headlights performance last night.<br><br>Say what you like about their (PSG) quality, I don&#39;t have any issues (apart from being jealous) with how good they are, I&#39;m annoyed by how poor we were. You can almost whittle it down to one thing, once again. First touch. I must&#39;ve counted about 6 times in the first half alone when one of our players touch let them down. Which is actually not like us but again, rabbit in the headlights. <br><br>If you&#39;re playing a team like PSG then you either try and play your own game or you try and be very compact. We did neither. All the talk of whether a centre half should&#39;ve been signed or shouldn&#39;t have due to lack of impact is an utter nonsense. If you have funds (and we do) then you try to improve. I choose to believe we tried and failed but last night isn&#39;t about one transfer window, it&#39;s about the last 5. <br><br>Teams in Scotland regularly run us close, it hasn&#39;t all been 4 goal winning margins. Their budgets compared to ours are comparable. Let&#39;s not accept this, I&#39;m fairly sure our manager won&#39;t be happy this morning and if any of the players are they should gtf. Take it on the chin and go and show Anderlecht we&#39;re FAR better than we showed last night. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div class="gel-layout__item gel-bp-s-1/2 gel-1/2@s"><h3 class="gel-mb gel-great-primer-bold">Celtic</h3><ul class="list-ui list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="list-ui__item">01 Gordon</li><li class="list-ui__item">56 Ralston <i>Booked at 53mins</i></li><li class="list-ui__item">23 Lustig</li><li class="list-ui__item">05 Simunovic <i>Booked at 39mins</i></li><li class="list-ui__item">63 Tierney</li><li class="list-ui__item">07 Roberts Substituted for Forrest at 78&#39;minutes</li><li class="list-ui__item">21 Ntcham</li><li class="list-ui__item">08 Brown</li><li class="list-ui__item">14 Armstrong Substituted for Rogic at 45&#39;minutes</li><li class="list-ui__item">11 Sinclair</li><li class="list-ui__item">09 Griffiths Substituted for Edouard at 69&#39;minutes</li></ul>Substitutes<ul class="list-ui list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="list-ui__item">06 Bitton</li><li class="list-ui__item">18 Rogic</li><li class="list-ui__item">22 Edouard</li><li class="list-ui__item">24 de Vries</li><li class="list-ui__item">35 Ajer</li><li class="list-ui__item">42 McGregor</li><li class="list-ui__item">49 Forrest</li></ul></div><h3 class="gel-mb gel-great-primer-bold">Paris SG</h3><div class="gel-layout__item gel-bp-s-1/2 gel-1/2@s"><ul class="list-ui list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="list-ui__item">16Areola</li><li class="list-ui__item">32Dani Alves</li><li class="list-ui__item">5Marquinhos</li><li class="list-ui__item">2Thiago Silva</li><li class="list-ui__item">20Kurzawa</li><li class="list-ui__item">6Verratti</li><li class="list-ui__item">8Motta</li><li class="list-ui__item">25RabiotSubstituted forDraxlerat 61&#39;minutes</li><li class="list-ui__item">29MbappeSubstituted forLo Celsoat 84&#39;minutes</li><li class="list-ui__item">9Cavani</li><li class="list-ui__item">10Neymar<i>Booked at 76mins</i></li></ul></div>Substitutes<ul class="list-ui list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="list-ui__item">1Trapp</li><li class="list-ui__item">3Kimpembe</li><li class="list-ui__item">7Lucas Moura</li><li class="list-ui__item">12Meunier</li><li class="list-ui__item">17Berchiche Izeta</li><li class="list-ui__item">18Lo Celso</li><li class="list-ui__item">23Draxler</li></ul>Goals<ul><li>Neymar (19&#39;

Already, this Group B campaign for Celtic looks like boiling down to a battle for third place with Anderlecht who lost at Bayern Munich. To compound Celtic&rsquo;s dismay last night, they also face fresh Uefa disciplinary action after a supporter invaded the pitch and attempted to kick Mbappe. <br> <br> In seeking a solution to the considerable problem posed by PSG&rsquo;s potent attacking triumvirate, Rodgers took the bold decision to hand Anthony Ralston his first European starting appearance for the club.<br> <br> The 18-year-old&rsquo;s inclusion at right-back allowed Lustig to join Jozo Simunovic in central defence. It was a set of circumstances which underlined the consequences of Celtic&rsquo;s lack of success in pursuing reinforcements for that department of the squad during the summer transfer window.<br> <br> Before PSG fully hit their stride in such emphatic style, Ralston made an encouraging enough start to the contest. The teenager certainly didn&rsquo;t appear overawed by the occasion as he made a some solid interceptions and also showed the physical aspect of his game with a couple of robust challenges on Neymar, the second of which earned him a &lsquo;no more&rsquo; signal from the Italian referee.<br> <br> <br> <br> While the visitors dominated possession from the off, it was Celtic who posted the first attempt on goal. Counter-attack was the key to any hopes they had of upsetting the odds and one such raid saw Olivier Ntcham drag a shot narrowly wide after 10 minutes when a pass to the unmarked Patrick Roberts on his right might have been a wiser choice.<br> <br> PSG were soon camping in and around Celtic&rsquo;s defensive third of the pitch, however, and Cavani provided the first warning sign of what was to come when his 15th minute tap-in from Layvin Kurzawa&rsquo;s cross was ruled offside.<br> <br> The Uruguyan front man then stung Craig Gordon&rsquo;s palms with a powerful 20 yard volley as PSG looked to move through the gears. Their opener arrived in the 19th minute, albeit not without an element of controversy.<br> <br> Celtic were incensed at the referee&rsquo;s failure to award them a free-kick for Thiago Motta&rsquo;s challenge on Scott Sinclair in the build-up. That said, Celtic were subsequently collaboraters in their own downfall as Leigh Griffiths cheaply conceded possession and PSG swept forward with Adrien Rabiot&rsquo;s through ball finding Neymar stealing a yard on Ralston before lofting an assured finish beyond Gordon from around 10 yards.<br> <br> Griffiths almost delivered a spectacular and rapid response for the hosts when he lined up a free-kick all of 35 yards out after Roberts&rsquo; weaving run was illegally halted by Marco Verratti. There were echoes of the striker&rsquo;s set piece double against England in June as he curled in a brilliant left foot effort which prompted an equally impressive one-handed save from Alphonse Areola.<br> <br> They were the kind of moments which had to go Celtic&rsquo;s way if they were to retain any prospect of a recovery. Instead, PSG tightened their grip on proceedings when they doubled their lead in the 34th minute.<br> <br> Verratti&rsquo;s cross from the right was headed back across goal by Neymar, dropping into the path of Cavani who missed the ball completely with a fresh air swipe. The Celtic defence were not quick enough to react and Mbappe pounced to drive a shot high into the net.<br> <br> Celtic were struggling to retain any worthwhile possession, while also expending huge energy in attempting to close down their technically superior opponents. The last thing Rodgers&rsquo; side required was the needless concession of a third goal before half-time but that was exactly the situation Simunovic put them in. A cross from Kurazawa was harmlessly over-shooting the penalty area when the big Bosnian inexplicably pulled back Cavani right in front of the referee who immediately pointed to the spot. Simunovic was also booked for his trouble before Cavani swept the penalty kick imperiously beyond Gordon. <br> <br> It was too much to take for one moronic home supporter who found a route through the stewards, running onto the pitch and managing to aim a kick at Mbappe before he was restrained and removed.<br> <br> Sinclair forced a decent save from Areola in first half stoppage time but it had been a chastening opening 45 minutes for Celtic.<br> <br> Rodgers made a change at the start of the second half, the ineffective Stuart Armstrong staying in the dressing room as he was replaced by Tom Rogic. The home crowd were roused by a more vibrant approach from their side who managed to force themselves onto the front foot for a spell.<br> <br> Their persistence was admirable with first Ralston and then Sinclair coming close to pulling a goal back before their respective efforts were smothered. There remained a constant sense, however, that PSG could re-impose themselves whenever they wished and Neymar missed a clear chance to increase the lead when he blazed a shot over after a dazzling five-man, one-touch passing move.<br> <br> The little Brazilian&rsquo;s late booking for taking a dive under a Lustig challenge at least allowed the Celtic fans to express some enjoyment at his expense as they produced one of their loudest cheers of a night.<br> <br> They were subdued by the finale to the match, however, as first Lustig diverted a cross from substitute Julian Draxler into his own net before Cavani&rsquo;s looping header completed the unwelcome record scoreline.<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> Neymar the pantomime villain torments Celtic once again<br> Sorry, we&#39;re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we can<br> <br> Waiting for Video...<br> <br> </font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">By Alan PattulloPublished: 06:00 <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Wednesday 13 September 2017<br> </font><font face="Calibri"><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><br></font></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Celtic were left down and out on London Road last night. What might happen in Paris perhaps doesn&rsquo;t bear thinking about.<br> <br> Paris Saint-Germain&rsquo;s all-black change strip helped lend an impression of sleek, almost sinister, invincibility. Celtic were mugged in their own backyard on a sobering, potentially costly, night for the Scottish champions.<br> <br> <br> As for Neymar, a goal 19 minutes into his return to Parkhead, his fifth in total against Celtic, meant it was another profitable outing against the Scots. Such fiscal terms are of course very appropriate when used in connection with Neymar, the world&rsquo;s most expensive player. Celtic are sorely aware of the Brazilian&rsquo;s value now, that&rsquo;s for sure. He might be Public Enemy No 1 in this corner of the world but he seems to feast on being the pantomime villain.<br> <br> He&rsquo;s now had a hand in 12 goals &ndash; seven assists, on top of his five strikes &ndash; in five Champions League games against Celtic. He should have had another, firing high over the bar midway through the second-half. But there was still time left for Celtic fans to obtain some satisfaction, a cheer such as normally greets a goal welcoming Neymar&rsquo;s booking for dissent after claiming to have been fouled by Anthony Ralston, his 18-year marker. The Bellshill defender posted a brave performance on a bruising night for more experienced members of the Celtic team. Even the 56 on the young defender&rsquo;s back doesn&rsquo;t get close in millions to the worth of his opposite man. <br> <br> While acknowledging the recent regeneration work carried out around Parkhead in recent years, it still felt slightly obscene to welcome a player worth &pound;200 million &ndash; and probably rising &ndash; to streets where real poverty still exists.<br> <br> A &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; theme developed on the pitch just to stress this point. But then how could it be otherwise? Celtic&rsquo;s most costly players were Scott Brown and Olivier Ntcham, willing, often exceptional workers but who suffered a reality check along with their team-mates last night.<br> <br> But there was no shame in this. Ten years earlier to the very night Brown was starring in a famous Scottish victory over French aristos</font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">in Paris. His victory is still being picked to play on this stage </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ndash;</font><font color="#000000" size="3"> his image was used in an impressive mock up of </font><font color="#000000" size="3">&ldquo;</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Liberty Leading the People&rdquo;, a famous painting by Eugene Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, unveiled by the Green Brigade before kick-off. <br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> <br> <br> Where ignominy existed was in the fan running on to the pitch to try to aim a kick at Kylian Mbappe just before half-time, with Celtic reeling at 0-3. Like his team, he fell far short, but the invader&rsquo;s incompetence was welcomed. Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive, will already be calculating the cost of an intruder seeking to maim the world&rsquo;s most expensive teenager. It won&rsquo;t be light. <br> <br> But there were better, more hopeful aspects to emerge last night. Ralston looks like he&rsquo;s stepped out of a 1950s comic strip. Big boned, committed and handed the biggest challenge of his young life by Brendan Rodgers, who&rsquo;s nothing if not bold, he sought to get to grips with Neymar. Ralston left the Brazilian on his expensive behind on a couple of occasions early on, clearly unfazed by the task. <br> <br> Like the first acorns, the Champions League theme tune and fluttering of centre-circle flag has become a reliable signal for autumn in these parts again under Rodgers. But this felt like Champions League in excelsis. Even after recent visits here from Barcelona, Manchester City and the rest, this was a bit special. Paris Saint-Germain might not have the history &ndash; not yet at least. Last night&rsquo;s match programme tried to supply them with some, erroneously giving their year of formation as 1870 rather than 1970. The confusion is understandable. Clubs formed in 1970 don&rsquo;t tend to have amassed enough appeal to submit a teamsheet like PSG did last night, which was worth around &pound;550m. Their front three of Neymar, Cavani and Mbappe alone are worth over &pound;400m. We love to reassure ourselves that money doesn&rsquo;t always talk, or guarantee glory, but it did last night. Opulence oozed from their pores. They weaved their way out of defence with the nonchalance of seamstresses producing an expensive shawl.<br> <br> <br> <br> PSG&rsquo;s strikers had bagged a goal each by half-time. Leigh Griffiths stumbled with the ball deep in the PSG half of the pitch, Ralston got the wrong side of Neymar after Adrien Rabiot&rsquo;s long ball. 0-1. Mbappe slashed in No 2 a dozen minutes later and then Cavani shot high past Craig Gordon from the penalty spot with five minutes left of the half. But Celtic were not let down on the park, they were let down off it &ndash; well actually on it, in a way &ndash; because one person in an otherwise superbly behaved crowd could not control his emotions.<br> <br> Two more goals at the end, an own goal from Mikael Lustig and another for Cavani, sealed Celtic&rsquo;s worst-ever European home defeat. Eyeing their first European Cup win, it might not be the only piece of history PSG will be creating this season.<br> <br> <br> <br> Brendan Rodgers: &lsquo;We were playing like under-12s at times&rsquo;<br> <br> By STEPHEN HALLIDAYPublished: 23:03 <br> Tuesday 12 September 2017<br> </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> <br> Brendan Rodgers insisted he wasn&rsquo;t concerned about presiding over Celtic&rsquo;s heaviest home defeat for 122 years as his team were crushed 5-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in the opening match of their Champions League group stage campaign.<br> <br> READ MORE - Celtic 0 - 5 PSG: How the Celtic players rated<br> <br> Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers at the end of the 5-0 defeat by Paris Saint Germain.

Mikael Lustig&rsquo;s own goal and Cavani&rsquo;s second of the match completed the rout. <br> <br> <br> It was a record-setting night Celtic will want to forget as quickly as possible.

But I don&rsquo;t want to be too harsh on my players. PSG are two or three levels beyond us. If we get better we can achieve the main aim, which is European football after Christmas.<br> <br> &ldquo;We could have been better in the first half, we were too passive, didn&rsquo;t press well enough and stood off. In the first half-hour of the second half, we were much better but you can always concede against players of that quality. It&rsquo;s a phenomenal squad that Paris have but I was proud of the players in the second half and the supporters were terrific, they kept encouraging us.<br> <br> &ldquo;At this level you have to make the ball work, and you have to have that belief. <br> <br> &ldquo;We were much better in the second half, we had a couple of wee moments in the final third, but you have to give Paris credit. They showed why they&rsquo;re going to be up there to win this competition. It&rsquo;s a tough lesson, a harsh lesson for us. This is a level which is all about learning for us, and tonight we&rsquo;ll learn from that.&rdquo;<br> <br> Rodgers also expressed his dismay at the pitch invader, who was loudly jeered by the rest of the Celtic support.<br> <br> &ldquo;The reaction [of the rest of the fans] said it all,&rdquo; said Rodgers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disappointing at any ground when a fan gets onto the pitch. I&rsquo;m sure the club will deal with that.

At 18 years old, he&rsquo;s got some great intangibles which should enable him to be a top defender for years to come, but this wasn&rsquo;t the game for him.<br> <br> After starting brightly, he was burned by Neymar for PSG&rsquo;s opening goal. In fairness to the young defender, Adrien Rabiot did a great job of anticipating his body movement and using it against him. Just as Ralston turned his shoulders, the pass was released, and he was caught with the wrong body shape to catch Neymar, who was always going to be too quick in a one-on-one race.<br> <br> There were also issues with the second goal (which we&rsquo;ll get to) and the fourth. At the latter one he could be seen as a little unlucky, with the ball been driven across at pace by Julian Draxler. However, he failed to anticipate the cross and was caught a little flat-footed, allowing the ball to go past him where it struck the unsuspecting Mikael Lustig and rolled into the back of the net. He&rsquo;s not the most nimble of defenders and would have been better suited to a scrappier contest, not trying to follow one of the most elusive forwards in world football.<br> <br> PSG&rsquo;s movement was too much to cope with<br> <br> The second goal was like a choreographed routine.<br> <br> <br> <br> It began with Neymar drifting in from the left to the centre to pick up possession. This drew Ralston over from right back. With Neymar entering his territory, Olivier Ntcham wandered off Marco Verratti in a bid to try and win the ball. Instead of staying in his position, Veratti moved into the open space down the right, which was vacant due to a combination of Scott Sinclair sticking close to Dani Alves, who&rsquo;d already slung in a couple of threatening crosses from the right, and Kieran Tierney tracking Kylian Mbappe as the attacker, who start on the right, moved into the centre.<br> <br> When Ntcham was too easily brushed off by Neymar, the Brazilian fed Verrati down the wing. He then turned back toward goal and sprinted into the penalty area, leaving Ralston in his dust. Incredibly, it is the striker who gets on the end of the looping cross at the back post. He&rsquo;s free partially because Ralston couldn&rsquo;t stick with him, and partially due to Edinson Cavani&rsquo;s front post run, which dragged Mikael Lustig away.<br> <br> When Neymar&rsquo;s header back across is fluffed by Cavani, Mbappe is in perfect position to follow up. The 18-year-old roamed free of Tierney after the Celtic full-back was forced to break from his man to close down Verratti&rsquo;s cross.<br> <br> Une oeuvre d&rsquo;art.<br> <br> <br> <br> READ MORE - Celtic 0 - 5 PSG: How the Celtic players rated<br> <br> Signing another centre-back wouldn&rsquo;t have helped much<br> <br> BT Sport&rsquo;s Chris Sutton was insistent this game highlighted Celtic&rsquo;s failure to recruit another centre-back in the summer. While this observation might be borne out come the conclusion of their Champions League campaign, with five other games in which to work with what they have, it wouldn&rsquo;t have made too much difference on Tuesday night.<br> <br> Sure, Lustig playing in his natural right-back position probably would have meant a better production in that spot, but you only have to look at the struggles of his centre-back partner to know the mammoth task Celtic were facing. <br> <br> Jozo Simunovic is arguably the best centre-back at the club and he was completely discombobulated by the PSG attack. So much so that he desperately wrapped his arms around Cavani to stop the striker getting to a cross, thus giving away a penalty, even though Layvin Kurzawa&rsquo;s centre would likely have sailed over their heads. He didn&rsquo;t cover himself in glory much at the fifth goal either.<br> <br> <br> <br> It&rsquo;s easy enough to say Celtic can improve on Simunovic, but getting a player of his talent - see his performances against Rosenborg and Astana - for the club&rsquo;s wage budget would have been a tough ask. Even had Celtic had all their central defenders fit, with Boyata in there alongside Simunovic, they still would have been on a hiding to nothing.<br> <br> Celtic were awestruck once more<br> <br> This writer didn&rsquo;t expect a thrashing because it seemed like this sort of lesson had already been learned.<br> <br> Matchday one of last season&rsquo;s Champions League group stage saw Celtic lose seven goals in Barcelona. While Lionel Messi and co were awesome that night, Celtic were complicit in their own downfall. They sat back and admired their opponents and let them waltz through untouched time and again.<br> <br> There was something about the Barcelona performance in this latest humbling. Celtic seemed to be stuck between trying to press high and wondering whether to stay back, and ended up doing neither. The defenders were often left isolated against arguably the most potent attack in world football, simply because the midfielders didn&rsquo;t do enough to stop the passes coming into their feet.<br> <br> Things improved a little in the second half, but then PSG clearly took their foot off the gas - and still scored twice more.<br> <br> The formation change didn&rsquo;t work<br> <br> Brendan Rodgers moved Celtic from the usual 4-2-3-1 to a 4-1-4-1, which often looked like a flat five in the middle of the park. Scott Brown&rsquo;s display highlighted a number of issues with how this system matched up against PSG. As the natural defensive midfielder, you expected him to sit in front of the back four. However, as PSG were not playing with a natural No.10 - Rabiot was the most advanced of the three, though he tended to move out wide - it left Brown without an obvious opponent to mark. He would often step out to try and lead the team press, creating further gaps to exploit behind him, which also partially contributed to PSG&rsquo;s second. The same goes for Ntcham, who was caught too high up the park trying to support the attack at the opener.<br> <br> With Stuart Armstrong having a dreadful game alongside them, one can&rsquo;t help but wonder if Celtic would have given a better account of themselves by having Ntcham and Brown sitting in front of the defence as an extra layer of protection, and Tom Rogic in the attacking midfield role. The Australian brings with him a certain presence, and this could have helped out the isolated Leigh Griffiths. Rogic didn&rsquo;t do much when he came on, but he was asked to operate further back than you normally expect to see him.<br> <br> This is all 20-20 hindsight. Who knows? They may have lost by ten if Rodgers went with the tried and trusted. It felt like PSG could have had any score they wanted.<br> <br> <br> </font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">BBC<br></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br> <br> <br> By Tom English<br> <br> BBC Scotland at Celtic Park<br> <br> <br> </font><font color="#000000" size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">12 September 2017</font></font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"> <br></font></font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> <br> Celtic sustained their heaviest ever home European defeat as Neymar led the way for Paris St-Germain in the Champions League group-stage opener.<br> <br> The world&#39;s most expensive player coolly finished and then had a hand in PSG&#39;s second, which was finished emphatically by Kylian Mbappe.<br> <br> Edinson Cavani converted a penalty for the visitors&#39; third before the break.<br> <br> Mikael Lustig&#39;s own goal was followed by Cavani&#39;s second of the night, a superb diving header.<br> <br> Elsewhere in Group B, hosts Bayern Munich won 3-0 against Anderlecht, who had a man sent off. <br> <br> Celtic players<br> <br> Celtic could not find a way to contain their visitors<br> <br> Celtic have hosted many of the great powerhouses of European football over the years, but even those with the longest memories would probably struggle to recall a side as devastating as PSG.<br> <br> Their speed of thought, speed of movement, accuracy and imagination was extraordinary. Their confidence on the ball - even when playing intricate passes in their own penalty area to get out of trouble - was a joy.<br> <br> Quality on this scale costs, of course. The biggest compliment you can pay the visitors is they looked every inch the half-billion-pound team they are.<br> <br> Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers went with young Tony Ralston at right-back with Lustig playing centre-half. Ralston was keen as mustard, biting into tackles on Neymar, but this was a night when enthusiasm and heart were not much use to Celtic. <br> <br> Unai Emery&#39;s visitors had the ball in the net after 15 minutes but Cavani was offside. It was a warning to Celtic, not that it was needed. The subtlety of PSG&#39;s play was not something they could cope with. Soon, the doors started opening for the visitors. <br> <br> Celtic had legitimate gripes about a foul on Scott Sinclair moments earlier, but when PSG countered it was precise and beautiful. Adrien Rabiot, relatively unsung in this team of stars but sensationally good on the night, played Neymar in behind Ralston and the Brazilian thumped his shot past Craig Gordon.<br> <br> <br> <br> Kylian Mbappe scores for Paris St-Germain against Celtic<br> <br> Mbappe (right) followed Neymar in scoring his first Champions League goal for PSG<br> <br> There were less than 20 minutes on the clock and all sorts of trouble was heading Celtic&#39;s way. They actually had some moments of optimism before PSG&#39;s second, Leigh Griffiths forcing a save from Alphonse Areola with a free-kick.<br> <br> This modicum of Celtic hope was soon batted away. It was as if PSG were telling them that if they had the temerity to come out and attack there might be a heavy price to pay for it at the other end.<br> <br> It was a moronic moment, an incident that governing body Uefa, correctly, will investigate. Heavy punishment is coming Celtic&#39;s way, that&#39;s a guarantee<br> <br> The second came, Neymar at the heart of it again, of course. It was he who started the move and when Marco Verratti put in a cross from the right, it was Neymar who made the run - Celtic had not a notion where he was - and then nodded across goal. Cavani had a fresh-air swipe but lurking behind him was Mbappe, who thumped in the second.<br> <br> A goal apiece for PSG&#39;s monster summer signings - and then a third for their principal goalscorer, Cavani. It was painfully soft from Celtic&#39;s perspective. A cross from Neymar, a push by Jozo Simunovic on Cavani and a penalty duly rifled home by the Uruguay striker.<br> <br> The Celtic fans who were not open-mouthed at PSG&#39;s class by now were covering their eyes at the thought of what might happen next. They had no idea that the next moment would be so shocking - and, inevitably, so damaging. <br> <br> A spectator ran on to the pitch, was allowed to make his way towards Mbappe and then appeared to aim a kick at the winger. Celtic fans booed him, but the damage was done.<br> <br> Edinson Cavani scores a penalty for Paris St-Germain against Celtic<br> <br> Cavani&#39;s penalty before half-time effectively ended the match as a contest<br> <br> It was a moronic moment, an incident that governing body Uefa, correctly, will investigate. Heavy punishment is coming Celtic&#39;s way, that is a guarantee. <br> <br> Rodgers brought on Tom Rogic for Stuart Armstrong at the break and, at last, Celtic got some respite. Griffiths should have done better with a header, Ralston had a fine run and Sinclair had a shot saved by Areola.<br> <br> PSG, in truth, were in relaxed mood through all of this. When they decided to get busy again they came close to adding more goals.<br> <br> <br> <br> Neymar<br> <br> Neymar missed two excellent chances before Rabiot&#39;s replacement Julian Draxler bamboozled Sinclair and crossed only for the unlucky Lustig to turn it into his own net.<br> <br> Cavani&#39;s magnificent angled header across goal and into Gordon&#39;s net made it five.<br> <br> A historic thumping against the super-rich, lavishly brilliant visitors, a team that will, surely, make a major assault on Real Madrid&#39;s grip on the Champions League trophy.<br> <br> Match stats - PSG scorers make their mark<br> <br> <br> Edinson Cavani scores for Paris St-Germain against Celtic<br> <br> Cavani completed the scoring with a stunning header<br> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">Celtic have now failed to keep a clean sheet in each of their past 20 Champions League games, conceding 48 goals along the way.<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">The Scottish side have not won a group-stage match in the competition since October 2013.<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">Celtic have never won their opening group-stage match in the Champions League.<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">Since season 2003-04, Neymar has been involved in more goals against Celtic than any other player against any other team in that time (12 - five goals, seven assists).<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">Mbappe is the first teenager to score in the Champions League for two different clubs (Monaco and PSG) and is the youngest ever scorer for both sides.<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3">No other player has scored more goals in the Champions League as a teenager than Mbappe (seven - level with Patrick Kluivert).<br></font><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><font color="#000000" size="3">◾</font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">Cavani is now PSG&#39;s all-time leading scorer in the Champions League with 22.<br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font><br></div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Celtic 0, Paris Saint Germain 5.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+4&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Celtic 0, Paris Saint Germain 5.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 89&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt saved.
