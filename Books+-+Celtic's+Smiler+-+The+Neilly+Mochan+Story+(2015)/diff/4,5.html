As player, trainer and kitman, Mochan was an integral figure in some of Celtic&#39;s greatest teams. <br><br>A hero of the 1953 Coronation Cup winning side and the record-breaking 7-1 team of 1957, Neilly went on to become a trusted lieutenant of Jock Stein after hanging up his shooting boots and was Celtic&#39;s first team trainer throughout the nine-in-a-row era when Celtic were feared throughout Europe, winning their most glittering prize in 1967 on an unforgettable afternoon in Lisbon. <br><br> Neilly&#39;s successes continued into the 1970s, when ten men won the league in 1979, and into the eighties, when Celtic won an emphatic League and Scottish Cup double in their centenary year of 1988. <br><br> From the pinnacle of European success to the depths of 1990s despair and the subsequent Fergus McCann takeover, &#39;Smiler&#39; tells the unrivalled story of Neilly Mochan and his 40-year Celtic Park odyssey.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Review</h3>(from The Scotsman)<br>  New book tells story of Celtic legend Neil Mochan<br><br>http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/new-book-tells-story-of-celtic-legend-neil-mochan-1-3975533<br><br>CHRIS McCALL<br><br>A NEW biography aims to place an often-forgotten Celtic legend back in the spotlight by recalling the extraordinary service he gave the Parkhead club over four decades.<br><br>Neil Mochan, known to friends and fans alike as Neilly, signed for the Hoops in 1953 and scored more than 100 goals in a seven year playing stint in the east end of Glasgow.<br><br>He would go on to serve Dundee United and briefly Raith Rovers with distinction before returning to Celtic as head trainer under Jock Stein in time to experience the glory days of nine-in-a-row title wins and the European Cup triumph of 1967.<br><br>Mochan remained on staff long after Stein left, switching to a non-coaching role in 1978 with the appointment of Billy McNeil as manager.<br><br>His remarkable service is remembered in Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler: The Neil Mochan Story, a new biography by Paul Dykes.<br><br>&ldquo;His life has never been covered in any great depth, which is strange as he was the coach of the Lisbon Lions,&rdquo; said Dykes.<br><br> I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any other individual in the club&rsquo;s history who was involved in as many successes in one capacity or another<br> Paul Dykes<br><br>&ldquo;They used to call them trainers back then, and a lot of his role was looking after the players&rsquo; fitness, but he was coaching the Lions.<br><br>&ldquo;Because of the success of Jock Stein people like Neilly Mochan and (assistant manager) Sean Fallon were left in the shade. The three of them were ex-Celtic players from the 1950s and they all played a massive role in the club&rsquo;s subsequent success. Stein was a footballing genius, no one is going to dispute that, but Neilly played a big part, as did Sean.&rdquo;<br><br>Mochan was born in Carron, near Falkirk, in 1927 and was first scouted while playing for local junior side Dunipace Thistle. He signed for Morton in 1944, where he scored a remarkable 57 goals in 82 appearances, before moving south to Middlesbrough.<br><br>He was less prolific on Teeside, and returned north to join Jimmy McGrory&rsquo;s then struggling Celtic side in 1953. The Hoops were enduring a fallow period prior to Mochan&rsquo;s arrival, at a time when Rangers and Hibernian were dominating the league.<br><br>His impact was immediate - scoring the goals that beat Arsenal then Hibs to land Celtic the Coronation Cup, a well-publicised pre-season tournament involving four of the best clubs from Scotland and England.<br><br>Celtic went on to win the double the following season, with Mochan top goal scorer. His form earned him a Scotland call-up and he was in the squad that took part in the ill-fated 1954 World Cup campaign.<br><br>Perhaps his most famous contribution as a player was his goals in the 1957 League Cup final, when the Hoops defeated Rangers 7-1 in a game still sung about by fans.<br><br>Dykes decided to write Mochan&rsquo;s story after meeting his son, Neilly junior, at the launch of his previous book on the Quality Street Gang - the late 1960s Celtic reserve side, many of whom would replace the Lisbon Lions.<br><br>After two years of writing and research, Dykes&rsquo; new book was launched at Celtic Park last week with several club legends in attendance, including Danny McGrain and Murdo Macleod.<br><br>&ldquo;They adored Neilly Mochan,&rdquo; said Dykes. &ldquo;After McNeil took over in &lsquo;78, Mochan&rsquo;s role changed. He had always acted as kitman, but he also looked after the groundstaff boys.&rdquo;<br><br>His role as kitman led him to amass an astonishing collection of continental strips, following the tradition of club kitmen exchanging jerseys before European matches.<br><br>Mochan continued to live in Camelon, a suburb of Falkirk, throughout his Celtic career. He was still employed as kitman in 1994 when he died aged 67 following a short illness.<br><br>&ldquo;Neilly was present during all Celtic&rsquo;s high points of the 1950s,&rdquo; Dykes added. &ldquo;Then from the late &lsquo;60s, into the &lsquo;70s and &lsquo;80s. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any other individual in the club&rsquo;s history who was involved in as many successes in one capacity or another.&rdquo;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Product Details</h3><li><b>Hardcover:</b> 278 pages</li><li><b>Publisher:</b> False 9 Media (18 Nov. 2015)</li><li><b>Language:</b> English</li><li><b>ISBN-10:</b> 1473328152</li><li><b>ISBN-13:</b> 978-1473328150</li><li><b>    Product Dimensions:      </b>    19.1 x 1.8 x 23.5 cm </li><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>     <h3>Links</h3><ul><li>[...]</li></ul></div></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Other Reviews</h3>  Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler &ndash; the Neilly Mochan story<br><br>7 days ago 0<br>Emdad Rahman<br><br>http://eastlondonnews.co.uk/celtics-smiler-the-neilly-mochan-story/<br><br>Smiler Mochan is a Celtic legend whose name doesn&rsquo;t crop up as much as it needs to, but I have seen his portrait hanging at Celtic Park.<br><br>Celtic Football Club is quite simply the stuff dreams are made of. Started off to help impoverished and starving children in Glasgow, this club has gone on to become one of the world&rsquo;s great football institutions. The achievements of Celtic players are part of the rich tapestry of this legendary club. Not many servants in the club&rsquo;s history can boast the pedigree of the late Neilly Mochan, and the launch and release of a new book and documentary have bought this stalwart&rsquo;s name and achievements right back to the fore.<br><br>The art of Duncan Mattocks greets you with a striking portrait of the subject on the front cover. As an avid follower of Scottish football, I decided to delve a little deeper and made contact with Paul John Dykes &ndash; author of Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler, a fascinating biography of the life of one of the greatest players to have worn a Celtic shirt. Smiler is simply an exploration of the life of the amazing Neilly Mochan and his 40-year Celtic Park love affair.<br><br>Mochan, whose parents escaped Donegal &ndash; one of the most impoverished of areas during the Irish potato famine &ndash; has a vastly underrated status within the ranks of who&rsquo;s who at Glasgow Celtic. He doesn&rsquo;t make the all-time Celtic legends lists and it is a wonder why, considering his achievements with the Glasgow giants.<br><br>Having researched the great man one, of my first questions to **** was about Mochan&rsquo;s worth in the modern game. He said: &ldquo;A figure like Neilly Mochan would be priceless in the modern game. Not in respect of his monetary value as a player, but for the fact that he instilled so much in the players around him. He looked after young ground staff boys like George Connelly, Brian McLaughlin, Tommy Burns, Charlie Nicholas and Peter Grant and guided them through their early years as footballers. They all respected Neilly and owed a lot of their successes to him.&rdquo;<br><br>Having made his name at Morton, the Carron Cannonball joined the Bhoys after a short stint in the north east of England, brought about because English legend David Jack took a shine to the Scots star and lured him to Middlesbrough. Over five glorious decades Smiler scored over 100 goals for the Bhoys, which assure him a place on the honour roll of the Hoops&rsquo; greatest players. He was also part of Jock Stein&rsquo;s backroom staff and, alongside Jock Stein and Sean Fallon, Mochan trained the never-to-be-forgotten Lisbon Lions.<br><br>Celtic Smiler<br><br>A the age of 23, Neilly was already known as &ldquo;Smiler&rdquo;. It was an affectionate moniker. He was a deceptive striker, and his first hat trick for his beloved Celtic was scored in front of 50,000 home fans. It was the first of many goals scored by Neilly Mochan in the hoops at Celtic Park, an occurrence that was often compared to the effects of a ring carronade cannon.<br><br>During the 50s Mochan scored the winner in the Coronation Cup Final, won the double in 1953/54 and hammered an unforgettable brace in the equally unforgettable &ldquo;Hampden in the sun&rdquo; 7-1 annihilation of Glasgow Rangers. Smiler made the Scotland squad for the World Cup finals in Switzerland in 1954. He gave unstinted and distinguished service to Scottish football. Mochan was a friend to all. The great Bobby Lennox described him as &ldquo;a &lsquo;buffer&rsquo;, the cement between the players and management.&rdquo; Dykes writes: &ldquo;Mochan&rsquo;s tale is Odyssean in its scale. His journey as rich as the passage of time itself, he would go on to become a fabled pioneer of the Scottish game, a progenitor of European trailblazing success, and an undisputed patriarch of Celtic Football Club.&rdquo;<br><br>After retiring from playing the game, Mochan became a loyal assistant to Jock Stein, under whom he was Celtic&rsquo;s first-team trainer throughout the nine-in-a-row era when the Club was feared throughout the continent, winning their most glittering prize in 1967 on an unforgettable afternoon in Lisbon. Neilly&rsquo;s successes continued into the 1970s, when ten men won the league in 1979, and into the &rsquo;80s, when Celtic captured the 100th Scottish Cup Final in typically cavalier fashion. The following season, he watched from the dugout as Celtic clinched a last-day title win at Love Street, and he was again on hand for the Club&rsquo;s emphatic League and Scottish Cup double in its centenary year of 1988. Mochan witnessed the dour 90&rsquo;s and the Fergus McCann takeover. He saw it all until his passing in 1994.<br><br>With four decades service and 50 winners&rsquo; medals in his kitbag, the Mochan legacy is an indelible part of Celtic folk memory. This book and documentary is the unrivalled story of the man whom team-mates, reporters, opponents and fans alike affectionately referred to as &ldquo;Smiler&rdquo;.<br><br>Mochan&rsquo;s brother Denis has the perfect description: &ldquo;Everyone who knew Neilly Mochan will tell you that he was a joker and a smiler.&rdquo; He also remembers the light-hearted nature of his big brother. &ldquo;Our Neilly was never dour. His nickname of &lsquo;Smiler&rsquo; was a football thing and we never called him that around the house. When you play football, your team-mates or newspaper reporters often give you nicknames and Neilly&rsquo;s was &lsquo;Smiler&rsquo;. He was the oldest of the boys in our house and we used to call him &lsquo;Our Big Yin&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br><br>The author does somewhat agree that Neilly Mochan has an underrated history at Celtic: &ldquo;I think the importance of Neilly Mochan has been underrated as he played in an inconsistent and under-achieving team in the 1950s (even though their triumphs were spectacular).<br><br>&ldquo;He was then part of Jock Stein&rsquo;s back-room team and so he would always be in the shadows there. However, the historians have always lauded his role and I hope that the biography and documentary can keep that fire burning now. I think that the &rsquo;50s are not as extensively covered as the &rsquo;60s and beyond and for that reason Neilly&rsquo;s story was in the vaults. Thankfully now I have told it in film and print and I hope a new generation of supporters can learn about Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler.<br><br>&ldquo;Neilly was a small, powerful, deceptively quick scorer of thunderbolt shots. He could play left wing, centre forward and even left back. There is no one like him! There are a few figures in the history of Celtic Football Club whose stories are legendary but for some reason no one has put them into print. Neilly Mochan served Celtic for 40 years and epitomised everything that was special about the club. It was an absolute honour to be asked by his son to write his story.&rdquo;<br><br>For more information, go to:<br>www.smilerdoc.com  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <span class="diffAdd">Review by Tom Campbell:</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I confess to having a  vested interest in this book.  Two or three years ago the author Paul  John Dykes contacted me to verify a point of information about Neil  Mochan&rsquo;s Celtic career, and he told me he was writing a biography of  Neil.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I was highly pleased, and intrigued.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Intrigued,  because nobody had ever got round to writing about Neil Mochan, a  life-long Celtic man who joined the club as a player in 1953 and who,  after retiring, returned to Celtic Park in the 1960s as a trainer (at  Jock Stein&rsquo;s insistence), and who was one of the manager&rsquo;s most trusted  lieutenants during &lsquo;the glory years&rsquo;. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">What stories he could tell!</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Pleased,  too &ndash; because Neil was a genuine Celtic man and surely more deserving  of recognition than other more flamboyant characters who spent a season  or two basking in the spurious glare of publicity at Celtic Park.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Who deserves a biography? </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Certainly the super stars do &hellip; but only if their lives and times were interesting.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And  probably cult-heroes, men who have somehow touched the hearts of the  supporters with their character and skill (although in some cases a lack  of skill might be a more accurate description).</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And the celebrity-type players, more famous for being famous or notorious for being famous or notorious.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Personally,  I sometimes wonder at the authors&rsquo; choices of fringe players unless  these men are articulate and intelligent enough to keep themselves out  of the narrative and concentrate on their more celebrated colleagues.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Neil Mochan?</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">An  analogy with the film industry might help.  At  the start of most film  the credits start to roll: the names of the two principal stars,  followed by the title and then &lsquo;ALSO STARRING&rsquo; with the names of the  better-known of the rest of the cast.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Of the &lsquo;ALSO STARRING&rsquo;, Neil Mochan would lead the way. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">But  that does not mean he was not a major player, either on the pitch or in later years in Celtic&rsquo;s back-room.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It  was Homer who originated the dramatic device of starting a story not at  the chronological beginning but at a later high point in the action &hellip;  and Paul John Dykes does that superbly in &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler&rsquo;.  He  describes a young Neil Mochan in 1950 playing at Celtic Park on the  first day of the league season, and surprising everybody with three  well-taken goals.  It was a typical performance by a natural  goal-scorer, and a herald of things to come for a player performing in  the hoops.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I admit that I (who have a fair knowledge about  Celtic&rsquo;s history) felt uneasy as I was reading this opening chapter  feeling that the author had lost his way, that his facts were wrong &hellip;  but, by a masterful sleight-of-hand, Paul John Dykes won me over. (And  it would be unfair to reveal exactly how).</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">From that moment I was hooked.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Typical  of a conscientious, detailed biography, shortly afterwards, the author  describes the subjects&rsquo;s youth and upbringing in the village of Carron  where the Mochans constituted a large, typically Irish immigrant family.   This is not mere background information; it provides insight into the  basis of Neil Mochan&rsquo;s character and values.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And there is  interesting material about Neil Mochan&rsquo;s early career too &hellip; and it is  clear to me that the author has traced that career with commendable  diligence.  He has done the leg-work:    spoken to family members,  interviewed contemporaries, checked the newspapers and football  magazines &hellip;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The result is a compelling read.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Concentrating  on this book, I have a personal admission to make.  I am a voracious  reader, and I read very quickly.  In addition, I have exacting standards  and have to confess that many sporting books I have been unable to  complete reading: lack of interest for the reader, frustration at errors  In fact, or awkwardness in style or language.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">That was not the case with &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo;s Smiler&rsquo;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I  read it at one sitting, and that is surely a clear indication of its  worth.  Perhaps even more noteworthy is the fact that about a week later  I re-read it cover to cover &hellip; and appreciated and enjoyed it even more.   I should add that these two readings were for simple enjoyment; it is  only recently that I was asked to review it.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Some books are  described rather patronizingly as &ldquo;a labour of love&rdquo;.  This biography is   more than that, imbued as it is with a fondness for the subject, a man  appropriately nicknamed &lsquo;Smiler&rsquo;.  It is an honest book about a  working-class &lsquo;hero&rsquo;, a boy born and raised in Carron and who parlayed  his skill and enthusiasm for football into a decent (no, an admirable)  career.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Paul John Dykes traces every aspect of that career  commendably, and avoids the obvious temptation to deal exclusively with  Neil&rsquo;s Celtic career (although that would have been enough for a book in  itself).  Think of that career:  signed for Celtic on the eve of the  Coronation Cup in 1953, a key member of the double-winning side of  1953/54, a player at Scotland&rsquo;s ill-fated 1954 World Cup expedition, a  scorer of two goals in Celtic&rsquo;s 7-1 triumph over Rangers in 1957, a  steadying influence on &lsquo;Kelly&rsquo;s Kids&rsquo; throughout that barren spell &hellip; and  then his return to Celtic Park as trainer to be re-united with Jock  Stein&hellip;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Arguably, the three most memorable matches in Celtic&rsquo;s  history are as follows:  the 7-1 League Cup final win in 1957, the  European Cup final at Lisbon in 1967, and the 4-2 title-clinching win  over Rangers at Celtic Park in 1979.   Neil Mochan, a true Celtic man  for more than forty years, was there (and played a vital part) in all  three:  as a player in 1957, as the trainer in 1967, and as kit-man in  1979.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Paul John Dykes deserves our thanks (and congratulations) for making us remember Neil Mochan.   </span><br></div>
