They changed their manager at exactly the wrong time  for us.<br><br>What I will say is I expect Celtic to give ourselves the  best possible chance. I expect Celtic to use the resources we have  available to fully back the manager in his lofty ambitions of signing a  centre half. Ambitions he has held since January. Just give us a chance.  Don&#39;t constantly be 1 or 2 injuries from Lustig or Bitton at centre  half. Tonight it was Lustig which put our best choice right back out of  position and left us hopelessly exposed on the right. Would a centre  half have got us a result ? Likely not. Would a centre half have given  us the best possible chance ? 100% and that is all we can ask. We didn&#39;t  have that tonight and it hopelessly exposed us.<br><br>The game itself man by man starting from the back:<br><br>Craig  Gordon is an utter liability. Good shot stopper but name me a goalie  that isn&#39;t. His kicking put is under so much pressure tonight, it was  horrendous. Priority position for me in January - a keeper that is  comfortable on the ball and comfortable with giving his defence a  bollocking. He&#39;s too timid.<br><br>Boyata was excellent I thought and  saved us from a true horsing. Won&#39;t be too critical of Lustig, he&#39;s not a  centre half. It&#39;s not his fault he&#39;s being played there. Gamboa is  someone I&#39;d have played tonight personally and thought he was excellent  on Saturday. Hopelessly exposed and had nowhere near enough support  added to the fact that defensively he&#39;s poor. Tierney is young and will  learn but my god he is an utter panic merchant on the ball and like  Gordon at times his distribution put us under the kosh. Defensively  thought he kept Robben relatively quiet so hard to criticise.<br><br>Midfield  thought Scott Brown was excellent. Cross field passing at times was  superb, kept it simple when he had to. Ntcham ? Far from convinced,  timid, looked like he had trampolines on his feet at times. At other  times he had excellent touches and looked a player. Passing seemed a bit  erratic. The game passed Armstrong by - if we are going to play him he  has to occupy the space Rogic does if only to get us 5-10 yards further  up the park. If he&#39;s not in there he&#39;s a wasted jersey imo.<br><br>Scott  Sinclair to me might be a luxury player in Europe at times. If he&#39;s not  being told to defend narrowly (which tbh I&#39;d be amazed if he wasn&#39;t as  its blatantly obvious to see) then he should be getting a bollocking  because he provides no cover to Tierney. If he&#39;s being told to play like  that then Rodgers needs to wake up because that&#39;s 2 games in a row. Ffs  Roberts offered more defensive support. Going forward I thought  Sinclair did look a wee bit dangerous at times but seems a bit scared to  utilise his pace. Roberts our most dangerous player and thought he did  put in a shift but still left Gamboa too exposed. I&#39;d have played  Forrest personally but hey ho.<br><br>Griffiths. A primary 4 that has  found himself playing in amongst the primary 7s. Offered absolutely  nothing in the way of hold up play which is vital for us expecially if  floof baws in goals chooses to lump it in the general direction of our  lone striker. Time he was dropped, he&#39;s been poor for weeks for Celtic.<br><br>There&#39;s  a place for Tom Rogic and Moussa Dembele in this team in games like  this for me. Rogic offers you an option which bridges between midfield  and striker. Dembele gives you a chance of holding the ball up. Thought  Forrest was dangerous when he came on. Personally think maybe we can  only accommodate one of Sinclair or Roberts with the other wide player  being Forrest in games like this when we are under pressure.<br><br>Again  Rodgers has said we won&#39;t be scared. To me tonight we looked overawed  from the first minute. If we are going to apply a press, the full team  has to get involved. One or two trying to do it whilst the rest sit off  there men is criminal. Either press and fully apply it or set up like  Lennon used to in Europe in games like this and absorb pressure by being  compact.<br><br>Disappointing night, but to be expected. I&#39;m more  disappointed that we didn&#39;t give ourselves the best possible chance that  we could. Still this game is a freebie, looked like a great trip for  the fans and we have a massive game on Saturday.<br><br><br>(Canneolli of KDS)<br>As I say often, you can spin it how you like.<br><br>The performance in  itself was nowhere near good enough, we lost 3-0 and it was a convincing  loss. I think that is the main point in the whole discussion. Brendan  obviously wants us to play are certain style of football and we are  reaping the rewards of this domestically and in Europe to a certain  level.( Qualifying for the Champions League in successive years). Man  City at home was a high point last year as well as away at Gladbach and  this year we have had a great win against Anderlecht. Last year we were  disappointing at home to Gladbach and this year we have been poor at  home to PSG and again last night. <br><br>Sport at a high level is tough  and a better opponent will always exploit your weaknesses, I play a  game at a decent level and when people see me play they think im good  but in reality i am average at best when playing at the top level. It is  so hard to play your top game when someone is putting you under massive  pressure when you make a mistake and on top of that your opponent is  good in his own right. Unforced errors increase and you feel under  pressure a lot. When you play someone at a lesser level it easier to  stamp your mark on the game and you get confidence from being the better  player as well. When I play the top players I could change up my game  but I play my attacking style but rarely will it show up in a big game  apart from occasional glimpses, but I will stick to my principles as its  how I want to play the game. The best players play it that way and I  try to learn from playing the best and learn from my mistakes and keep  improving. Will I ever be good enough to beat the best? unfortunately  not.<br><br>Anyway the point im trying to make is, Brendan has his style  and I think his style is the right way to play football. We are just  into our second season of his 5 years project, we are playing at a very  high level domestically against inferior opponents yes, but the manner  in which we are winning and the consistency we are showing is not an  easy thing to do. Yes we are coming up short at the very highest level  of European football, but there was a lot of positives last night and we  are making progress. We might never be able to compete with the top  teams, but we are trying to bridge the gap playing the game the Celtic  way. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><br><div class="sp-c-tabs__panel-content"><div><div class="gel-layout"><div class="gel-layout__item gel-1/2@s"><h3 class="gs-u-mb gel-great-primer-bold">Bayern Munich</h3><ul class="gs-o-list-ui gs-o-list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">26Ulreich</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">32KimmichSubstituted forRafinhaat 80&#39;minutes</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">17Boateng</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">5Hummels</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">27Alaba</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">19Rudy</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">6Thiago Alc&aacute;ntaraSubstituted forVidalat 67&#39;minutes</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">10Robben</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">25M&uuml;ller</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">29ComanSubstituted forRodr&iacute;guezat 78&#39;minutes</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">9Lewandowski</li></ul>Substitutes<ul class="gs-o-list-ui gs-o-list-ui--top-no-border gel-pica"><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">4S&uuml;le</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">11Rodr&iacute;guez</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">13Rafinha</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">22Starke</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">23Vidal</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">24Tolisso</li><li class="gs-o-list-ui__item">34Friedl</li></ul>Goals<ul><li>M&uuml;ller (17&#39;

men outclassed<br>A dispirited Mikael Lustig as Bayern Munich celebrate the opening goal. Picture: Getty <br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/bayern-munich-3-0-celtic-brendan-rodgers-men-outclassed-1-4590614<br><br>Andrew Smith<br><br>Published: 21:37 Wednesday 18 October 2017 <br>Share this article<br>&bull; <br>&bull; <br>&bull; <br>146 <br>Have your say <br>Champions League nights are forever presented as occasions to be embraced by Celtic but their flailing in the Allianz was another evening in the competition simply to be endured by the Scottish champions. <br>Brendan Rodgers spoke pre-match about his team&rsquo;s duty to show the nerve to play their own game in the exalted company provided by Bayern Munich in an effort to avoid another heavy defeat by one of the elite members of the European game. In the past 14 months Celtic have lost 5-0 against Paris Saint-Germain and 7-0 against Barcelona.<br>But the utterly predictable one-sided nature of the contest was not down to some dereliction on the part of his players, so much as deficit in talent compared to their Bavarian hosts. Their movement and power, even amidst some wastefulness in possession, was all too much for Rodgers&rsquo; side, who were fortunate that the scoring did not assume the proportions of these other lancings. Two goals down inside 28 minutes to efforts from Thomas Muller and Joshua Kimmich, Bayern missed a raft of second-half opportunities after going 3-0 ahead in the 50th minute thanks to Mats Hummels. <br>Never is the chasm in quality Celtic cannot bridge more cruelly exposed in the Champions League domain than in the defensive department. Another makeshift backline made for an impossible shift for those within it. In truth, it is doubtful it would have made much difference had Jozo Simunovic had been fit enough to partner Dedryck Boyata. Yet it certainly didn&rsquo;t help Celtic&rsquo;s cause that Mikael Lustig had to be detailed to do that job, which meant Cristian Gamboa filling the right-back berth vacated by the Swede. <br>It was painful to watch the Costa Rican, in only his second start of the season, corkscrewing as he attempted to deal with Kingsley Coman. He strived manfully to avoid constantly seeing the back of the Frenchman but he&rsquo;ll probably be picturing the winger&rsquo;s no.29 even when he closes his heavy lids later tonight.<br>There is no reason to expect Celtic to be able to live with any &ldquo;superclub&rdquo;, as Rodgers called a monied Munich side with pretensions to win the trophy. And one with vigour renewed following the return of Jupp Heynckes, the club&rsquo;s go-to manager who was in the technical area for a Champions League outing for the first time since leading the club to victory in the final weeks of his third spell four years ago. Never mind that they were on a 10-game winning run in the group stages in their epic 70,000 arena that is all bells and whistles and more bells, the pre-match razzmatazz that amounted to a riot of colour and noise that would have been befitting of a concert by one of those soft rock stadium-fillers which the Germans seem to so beloved.<br>Instead, it was a soft touch of an opponent that provided the entertainment because for all that Bayern are operating many levels above Celtic, the Glasgow side did nothing to make Bayern extend themselves to pick off goals. It was only Arjen Robben, making his 100th appearance in the competition, that they had any real joy in frustrating. Clearly desperate to bag a goal as he brought up his century, he was deprived when Gamboa threw himself across the goal-line to block a header from the Dutchman.<br>Such body-on-the-line moments were too few as Bayern seemed to find space in the final third with alarming ease. The warnings were there before an opener that followed from Robert Lewandowski drifting into a different timezone from a static Lustig and Boyata to meet a Joshua Kiimmich chip from right-hand channel. A low header brought a superb one-handed hand save down to his left from Craig Gordon - who made a series of notable stops across the evening - only for the rebound to be drilled in by Muller.<br>The second came when Coman had Gamboa revolving like a spinning top before hanging up a cross that Kimmich attack at edge of the box to head powerfully into top left hand corner with precision and ease. The third goal was another of utter simplicity with Hummels run and jump to head in a Robben corner a training ground manoeuvre nonchalance about it. There was little in the way of the physicality or aggression sought by Rodgers but there was some sort of token resistance with Scott Sinclair and late substitutes Moussa Dembele and Tom Rogic ensuring there was goalmouth action that provided the possibility that a consolation could be registered. Sinclair, indeed, had the ball in the net only for his strike to be ruled out for offside - Bayern having two &lsquo;goals&rsquo; that met this fate.<br>The Champions League contest Celtic are in does not involve the Munich, who will be at Celtic Park in fortnight for the return, or PSG but is between them and Anderlecht. And thanks to their 3-0 win in Brussels last month, at the halfway stage of the group campaign, and with the Belgians pointless, that is at least one they are in a position to prosper in.<br>What the German newspapers are saying about Bayern Munich 3-0 Celtic<br>Craig Gordon punches the ball as Thomas Muller, Olivier Ntcham and Dedryck Boyata look on. Picture: AFP/Getty Images <br>CRAIG FORBES<br>Published: 14:44 Thursday 19 October 2017 <br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/what-the-german-newspapers-are-saying-about-bayern-munich-3-0-celtic-1-4591271<br>Germany&rsquo;s newspapers contain a lot of post-match coverage and analysis following Bayern Munich&rsquo;s 3-0 win over Celtic at the Allianz Arena last night. Here&rsquo;s a quick look at what the German media are saying... <br>A match report in the Munich-based publication Suddeutsche Zeitung suggested that the game wasn&rsquo;t a stern test for Bayern, with manager Jupp Heynckes bemoaning the number of chances that his players passed up.<br>However, the paper&rsquo;s football writers singled out Patrick Roberts for particular praise, describing his performance as &lsquo;courageous&rsquo; while also highlighting Cristian Gamboa&rsquo;s torrid time against both David Alaba and Kingsley Coman.<br>A preview of the game in daily tabloid Bild said that &lsquo;realistically, [Celtic] are only candidates for the Europa League - unless they can pull off a surprise in the Allianz Arena.<br>&ldquo;Due to the lack of serious competition in the Scottish Premiership, Celtic are not a European heavyweight, but have a great deal of quality in their squad.&rdquo;<br>Leigh Griffiths was described as having a &lsquo;thankless task up front&rsquo; while Stuart Armstrong &lsquo;played quite well in midfield&rsquo;. <br>Zeit&rsquo;s online report said that &lsquo;Bayern&rsquo;s dominance gave Celtic no chance&rsquo; while Abendzeitung also went with Heyncke&rsquo;s criticism of his team despite the 3-0 win: &ldquo;We have to be bright and defensive from the first to the last minute.&rdquo;<br>Berliner Morgenpost headlined their match report: &ldquo;Bayern win with ease over Celtic,&rdquo; adding that Celtic were &lsquo;lucky that [the scoreline] wasn&rsquo;t higher&rsquo;. <br>Spiegel journalist Marco Fuchs highlighted the &lsquo;unequal duel&rsquo; between &lsquo;the unfortunate Cristian Gamboa&rsquo; and Kingsley Coman while the publication&rsquo;s match report labelled Celtic &lsquo;harmless visitors from Glasgow&rsquo;. <br>The Local focused on events away from the match, highlighting disgruntled Munich residents complaining about the mess Celtic fans had left in Marienplatz.<br>According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, around 10,000 Celtic fans were expected to travel to the city for the match but only around half that number had tickets for the game.<br>Focus carried quotes from Heynckes: &ldquo;It was important to get back on track in the Champions League but in the second half we became a bit careless.<br>&ldquo;Celtic had a few chances, and we still have to improve a lot.&rdquo;<br>Sport1 had reaction from former Bayern Munich captain Lothar Matthaus, who said that the matches against Freiburg and Celtic were what Bayern needed after their defeat to PSG.<br>The ex-Germany international said: &ldquo;The two games came at just the right time for Bayern. Freiburg [are struggling] in the Bundesliga and Celtic are also a beatable team.&rdquo;<br>Moira Gordon: Celtic far from equal to latest European challenge<br>The gulf between Brendan Rodgers&#39; side and the rest in Scotland is small beer compared with the chasm on view in Munich last night. Picture: Getty. http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/moira-gordon-celtic-far-from-equal-to-latest-european-challenge-1-4590699<br>Before kick-off in the Allianz Arena the players and officials all lined up to promote Uefa&rsquo;s #equalgame  initiative, a campaign aimed at promoting inclusion, diversity and accessibility in football throughout Europe. The fact is there was little equality once the whistle sounded and the Champions League action got underway.<br>And, as the match progressed, the chances of Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; men being granted access to the premier European club competition beyond the group stage began to dwindle.<br>Celtic possibly showed their hosts too much respect as the vulnerabilities and doubts that have often  crippled them on continental away days returned to burden them.<br>It had been hoped that the away win in Belgium, against Anderlecht, had dislodged that particular monkey from their back. It had left them sitting level with Bayern Munich in Group B and fostered hope in the 4,000-odd Celtic fans in the ground, and the thousands more watching at home, that, maybe, just maybe, they could upgrade their ambitions. <br>Bayern Munich are a side who have struggled, in relative terms. Two losses in 12 games at the start of their season was deemed unacceptable, demonstrating the level of expectation. That offered Scotland&rsquo;s dominant force a glimmer of light and there was the suggestion that a draw would allow them to aim beyond the Europa League and  look at progressing to the knockout stage of the Champions League instead.<br>But, if they started the game level on points, with similar hopes, the battle was not contested on a level playing field &ndash; with the gap between Celtic and the rest of the Scottish clubs small beer compared to the gulf in finances and quality between them and their German hosts &ndash; and that was soon reflected in the  performances and scoreline.<br>Things that may seem easy on home turf, where domestic resistance has proved futile for over a season, were more difficult with the likes of Arjen Robben and Kingsley Coman running at a makeshift defence and Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller using their class and ability to pile on the pressure and give the rattled Christian Gamboa and Co a night they will want to forget.<br>Celtic just couldn&rsquo;t get a foothold in the match and failing to engineer even one shot on target in the first half left them in unfamiliar territory. Two goals down by the interval, courtesy of Muller and Joshua Kimmich, they will have pondered the right approach as they returned for the second half; sit in and keep things respectable or go for it and risk a repeat of the spanking they received from PSG.<br>In the end they were unable to challenge yet unwilling to collapse. By the time they made up their minds to have a go, throwing on Tom Rogic and James Forrest, and Kieran Tierney&rsquo;s shot grazed the post in the 70th minute and Scott Sinclair and Rogic both had efforts minutes later, they were already another goal behind and Bayern had eased off enough to permit the odd advance.<br>According to the Uefa #equalgame webpage, everyone &ldquo;should be able to enjoy football, no matter who you are, where you&rsquo;re from or how you play. That&rsquo;s Equal Game&rdquo;. But, in certain circumstances, particularly on the Champions League stage, Celtic were served a punishing reminder that there are times when who you are, where you&rsquo;re from and how you play does matter. <br>  <br><br><br><h3>  Celtic fans hailed by Munich police for behaviour during Champions League trip</h3><br>The German police were delighted with how Celtic fans acted before and after the match.<br><br>Record Sport Online<br> 17:29, 20 OCT 2017Updated17:46, 20 OCT 2017<br><br>Celtic fans have been praised by Munich police for their behaviour during their midweek Champions League game.<br><br>Hoops supporters travelled to Germany in their thousands to back their side as they were beaten 3-0 by Bayern.<br><br>The Bundesliga champions may have been victorious on the park but the Celtic faithful earned plenty of praise for their performance off the pitch.<br><br>Munich police were impressed with Celtic and their followers before and after the match.

It&#39;s not going to happen overnight.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s constant experience but there was enough in the game for me to see the players are improving and it&#39;s something we&#39;re developing over the coming years hopefully.&quot;<br><br><br>Celtic: Brendan Rodgers says Champions League &#39;disappointment&#39; is gone<br><br>By Rhona McLeod<br><br>BBC Scotland<br><br> From the section Football <br><br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers<br>Brendan Rodgers says Celtic are focusing on securing their place in the League Cup final<br>Scottish League Cup semi-final - Celtic v Hibernian<br>Venue: Hampden Park Date: Saturday, 21 October Kick-off: 12:15 BST<br>Coverage: Listen live on BBC Radio Scotland, live text commentary on BBC Sport website &amp; app<br><br>Brendan Rodgers insists &quot;all the disappointment is gone&quot; from Celtic&#39;s Champions League defeat as they target a place in the League Cup final.<br><br>Celtic lost 3-0 to Group B opponents Bayern Munich and return to domestic matters and a semi-final against Hibernian at Hampden on Saturday.<br><br>Rodgers said his Celtic side have demonstrated they can bounce back from European losses.<br><br>And the Celtic manager expects &quot;a tight game, a tough game&quot; at Hampden.<br><br>&quot;We got back in the early hours of Thursday morning so the boys had a free day yesterday to recover,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not a new situation for us. It&#39;s about preparing the best you can physically and mentally; come tomorrow the players will be ready.<br><br>&quot;They have got this real determination and it&#39;s something we will take into the game.<br><br>&quot;We go with an aggressive, positive mindset and we hope we have the game model to get us a victory.<br><br>&quot;If you look back to last year&#39;s semi-finals and finals, we played very well. We played with composure and confidence in the pressure situations.&quot;<br><br>In defence of the trophy, Rodgers chooses from the same squad, with defenders Jozo Simunovic, Erik Sviatchenko and Anthony Ralston still missing through injuries.<br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers<br>Rodgers picked up the League Cup last season as Celtic completed an unprecedented unbeaten treble<br><br>Simunovic did not travel to Germany after the recurrence of a hamstring problem.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a repeat of what he had before, so he&#39;s probably out for a few weeks but I&#39;ll get more detail on that today,&quot; said Rodgers, who played Mikael Lustig at centre-half against Bayern and used Cristian Gamboa at right-back.<br>&#39;The players are on the right track&#39;<br><br>Gamboa was given a torrid time on Wednesday as Rodgers stuck with his usual 4-2-3-1 system against the five-time champions of Europe.<br><br>In the wake of a one-sided defeat, the manager was adamant that he would not change his approach and he touched on the topic again.<br><br>He explained: &quot;As a manager, what you learn, especially with experience, is that if you ever go down, go down with your own vision. Not with someone else&#39;s.<br><br>&quot;People say park the bus or be pragmatic. We tried that in Barcelona. We lost 7-0.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not how I work. We have an idea of how we play which is first and foremost fundamentally an aggressive way to defend.<br><br>&quot;If you look at the competitions, we defend well, we press well. But of course if you are playing against that level of quality, at times that quality can open you up.<br><br>&quot;But for us it&#39;s just about progress. The players are on the right track.<br><br>&quot;First half, we didn&#39;t have as many attacking moments as we would have liked. But the players grew into the game and in the last 30 minutes they showed the confidence, if you play that way, you can still create opportunities.<br><br>&quot;We reflect on that and we move on.&quot;<br><br><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, FC Bayern M&uuml;nchen 3, Celtic 0.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+4&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, FC Bayern M&uuml;nchen 3, Celtic 0.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+4&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt  blocked.
