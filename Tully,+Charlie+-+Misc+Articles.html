Of course  we were hearing about him by way of the Forces Radio, but he was to play  a part in my life I couldn&#39;t even dream about at the time. He was so  popular in Glasgow that the joke doing the rounds were like: The Pope  was visiting Glasgow and Charlie Tully was showing him around. The  people in the crowd turned to each other and said, &quot;Who is that with  Charlie Tully?&quot; His prowesss on the football pitch was becoming  legendary. <br><br>The letters I received from my father were full of  wonder at this player and he sent me all sorts of cuttings from  newspapers telling of his exploits. One I can remember seeing for myself  when I got home was the match against Falkirk at Brockville. Tully took  a corner kick and scored direct, but the referee ruled the goal out  because the ball was outside the corner arc. So Tully grabbed the  referee and took him accross to the corner where the kick was to be  re-taken. What did Tully do? He promptly took the kick again AND AGAIN  SCORED DIRECTLY!! <br><br>But I am getting ahead of myself as this was  in the future. So to go back to 1948... In October of that year I had my  accident and was in a very bad way indeed. In so much of a bad way that  the Army decided to bring my father over to Italy to see me, telling  him on the way over that he was probably coming over to bury me. When my  father arrived I was still drifting in and out of consciousness, which  lasted for five days and nights. Sometimes when I awoke I could see my  father with the tears running down his face. <br><br>Still when I had  stabilised, he took a life-sized poster of Charlie Tully and pinned it  above my bed. He said to me, &quot;Come on son, you will have to get better  so you can come home to see this wonderful player. He is even better  than Patsy Gallagher.&quot; Now! For my father to admit to something like  that meant that Charlie Tully must be very special indeed. From then on I  gradually improved and the doctors all agreed that the poster of  Charlie Tully might have been the vital spark I needed to make me want  to live. My chances before this looked very shaky. <br><br>My Dad stayed  with me for nineteen days. He was made a Sergeant in the Yorkshire  Light Infantry so that he had a place to stay and my mother would get an  allowance all the time he was with me. He only left me after my leg was  amputated and my condition had been reduced from Critically Ill to  Seriously Ill - this was just Army jargon, but it meant I was going to  live after all and so my Dad could go home. It took a whole year to get  home, plaster of paris gradually being removed from my arms, my head, my  pelvis and eventually my leg (when the stitches were removed) showing  signs of healing, enough for me to get about on crutches. <br><br>Can  you wonder, then, that my hero is Charlie Tully? He saved my life. I am  convinced of this, and I am happy to say I went on to watch him play  some wonderful stuff on the football pitch. His fondness for the bottle  only made him all the more endearing and made him out to be just like  &quot;one of us.&quot; <br><br>Next to Pele, he was the finest player I ever saw.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  The Scotsman: A loyal servant </h3>  <div class="info">  Scotsman, The (Edinburgh, Scotland)<br>April 19, 2003<br>Author: JOE McAVOY</div>  <div class="info">   BORN in Belfast, 1924, Charles Patrick Tully signed from Belfast  Celtic in June 1948. The names were the same, the strips were the same,  even the clubs&#39; aims were the same - to alleviate the plight of  beleaguered working-class Catholics.<br><br>Tully&#39;s reputation was  cemented, as is often the case with Celtic&#39;s greatest players, with an  outstanding performance against Rangers weeks after his arrival. This  catapulted him to the status of cult hero - &quot;Tully Mania&quot; gripped the  East End. Unlike today&#39;s iconic players, who crave lucrative contracts  and fan adulation in equal measure, Tully was a great servant of the  club, notching up 319 appearances and scoring 47 goals throughout an  illustrious 11-year career. Most fans reckon he is the best inside-left  ever to have played for the club. <br><br><div class="text">  His most  notable game was in a 1953 cup tie against Falkirk at Brockville, when  Tully scored not one but two sensational goals - direct from the corner  kick. (Not even Beckham could bend it like that, twice.) Celtic were 3-2  winners.</div>  <div class="text">  </div>  <div class="text">  Tully  had already scored a goal from the corner flag in 1952, when, earning  one of his ten international caps for Northern Ireland against England,  he scored another brace to level the match. It became something of a  habit.</div>  <div class="text">  </div>  <div class="text">  Tully was legendary for his cheek and his charm; before this game against England he is reported to have said to Alf Ramsey:<br><br>&quot;Do  you enjoy playing for your country, Mr Ramsey?&quot; asked Charlie. &quot;I do,  Mr Tully,&quot; replied the ever-polite future knight. &quot;Make the most of it  today, then,&quot; came back the irrepressible Irishman, &quot;it might be the  last chance you get.&quot;<br><br>During the St Mungo Cup Final on August 1,  1951, Celtic were 2-0 down when Tully took a throw-in. He deliberately  directed the ball off Dons&#39; Davie Shaw&#39;s back to win a flag kick. Tully  flighted over the corner, Sean Fallon scored and this started a comeback  that saw Celtic run out 3-2 winners.<br><br>In the twilight of his  career, Tully spent brief periods on loan to Stirling Albion and Rangers  before leaving Scotland in 1959. He eventually went into club  management in Ireland.<br><br>Charlie Tully was given a free transfer on Wednesday, September 2, 1959.<br><br>Tully made 319 appearances for The Bhoys during his 11 seasons at Celtic Park.<br><br>Charlie  Tully died peacefully  in his sleep on 27th July 1971 aged 47 at his  home in Belfast, a few months after playing in a charity match at  Meadowbank. During the funeral procession, the Falls Road was packed  with mourners from both sides of the sectarian and footballing divide. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h2>The hero who came to tea</h2></div></div>  <div>  <i>Published Date: 19 April 2003(The Scotsman (<a class="external" href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2420125" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link</a>))</i></div>  <div class="byline">  <i>By Bernard MacLaverty&rsquo;s<br><br></i></div>  <div class="ds-firstpara">  Our two rented houses faced each other across the street - my father&rsquo;s at 73 and Aunt Cissy&rsquo;s at 54.</div>  <div class="va-bodytext">   I knew my father&rsquo;s work had something to do with drawing and  lettering. I&rsquo;d found things in cupboards - small blocks of wood topped  with grey zinc metal. If there was lettering on this metal it was always  backwards, unable to be read. In cupboards there were pages of pink  paper, thick as slices of bread, with lettering pressed into them and  bulldog clips full of his newspaper adverts. <br><br>At the moment he  was illustrating a Bible for schools. He&rsquo;d shown me a drawing for the  Cure at Capharnaum and, as an exercise, made me read aloud the caption:  &quot;They could not get in because the house was crowded out, even to the  door. So they took the stretcher onto the roof, opened the tiles and let  the sick man down .&quot; <br><br>I was about eight or nine at the time. It was dead easy. <br><br>It  was a Sunday and felt like a Sunday. Family Favourites was on the  wireless. My father sat beneath the window for the best light. <br><br>&quot;What you doing ?&quot; <br><br>He held up the drawing. <br><br>&quot;Abraham and his son, Isaac,&quot; he said. A man with a white beard beside a boy carrying a tied-up bundle of sticks. <br><br>&quot;Where is the victim for the sacrifice? That&rsquo;s what the boy is saying.&quot; My father put on a scary, deep voice and said, <br><br>&quot;Little  does he know ...&quot; He drew quietly for a while. The pen scratched  against the paper and chinked in the ink bottle. He had a pad on the  table and sometimes he made scratches on it. &quot;Just to get the nib  going.&quot; Sometimes the pen took up too much ink and he shook it a little.  &quot;You&rsquo;re no good if you can&rsquo;t make something out of a blot.&quot; <br><br>The  hall door opened and footsteps came in off the street. My father  stopped and looked up. It was my cousin, Brendan, who was a year and two  months older than me. He was a good footballer. <br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s yourself, Brendy.&quot; <br><br>Brendan stopped in the middle of the floor and said, &quot;Charlie Tully&rsquo;s in our house having a cup of tea.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Go on. Are you kidding ?&quot; <br><br>&quot;No.&quot; <br><br>My father gave a low whistle. <br><br>&quot;This  we will have to see.&quot; He wiped his pen on a rag, then rinsed it in a  jam jar of water. He blew on his drawing then folded the protective  tissue over it. <br><br>&quot;Come on.&quot; All three of us went across the road. The only car parked on the street belonged to Fr Barney. <br><br>&quot;Did Barney bring him?&quot; Brendan nodded. <br><br>&quot;And Terry Lennon.&quot; <br><br>Terry  Lennon was a blind church organist. He had a great Lambeg drum of a  belly with a waistcoat stretched tight over it. He would sit in the  armchair by the fire smoking constantly, never taking the cigarette from  between his lips. A lot of the time he stared up at the ceiling - his  eyelids didn&rsquo;t quite shut and some of the white of his eye showed. Now  and again he would run his fingers down the cigarette to dislodge the  ash on to his waistcoat. Aunt Cissy called him Terry Lennon, the human  ash-tray. <br><br>When we went in Terry Lennon was in his usual chair.  Fr Barney stood in front of the fire with his hands behind him. On the  sofa was a man, still wearing his raincoat, drinking tea. His hair was  parted in the middle. He was introduced to my father as Charlie Tully. <br><br>&quot;You&rsquo;re welcome,&quot; said my father. &quot;Is that sister of mine looking after you?&quot; <br><br>Charlie Tully nodded. <br><br>&quot;The best gingerbread in the northern hemisphere,&quot; said Fr Barney. &quot;That&rsquo;s what lured him here.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Where&rsquo;s the old man?&quot; said my father. <br><br>&quot;The last I saw of him was heading up to the lavatory with the Independent.&quot; <br><br>&quot;He&rsquo;ll be there for a week.&quot; My father turned to the man in the pale raincoat. <br><br>&quot;I bet he was delighted to see you, Mr Tully - he&rsquo;s a bit of a fan.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Oh he was - he was.&quot; <br><br>&quot;So - how do you like Scotland?&quot; <br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s a grand place.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Will  Mr Tully have a cigarette?&quot; Terry Lennon reached out in the general  direction of the voice with his packet of Gallagher&rsquo;s Greens. <br><br>&quot;Naw, he only smokes Gallagher&rsquo;s Blues,&quot; said Aunt Cissy and everybody laughed. <br><br>&quot;If you&rsquo;ll forgive me saying so Mr Tully,&quot; said Terry Lennon, &quot;the football is not an interest of mine. You understand?&quot; <br><br>&quot;I do. You were making some sound with that organ this morning.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Loud  ones are great.&quot; Terry Lennon laughed. &quot;Or Bach. Bach is great for  emptying the place for the next mass. The philistines flee.&quot; <br><br>There was a ring at the door and Brendan went to answer it. When he came back he said it was Hugo looking for a drink of water. <br><br>&quot;And run the tap for a while,&quot; said Aunt Cissy laughing. &quot;Bring him in.&quot; <br><br>&quot;The more the merrier,&quot; said my father. <br><br>&quot;Wait  till you hear this, Mister Tully. Our Hugo.&quot; Brendan went into the  kitchen and ran the tap very fast into the sink. He carried a full cup  into the room and called Hugo from the door. Hugo edged into the room  and accepted the cup. There was silence and everybody watched him drink.  Hugo was a serious young man who was trying to grow a beard. <br><br>Fr Barney joined his hands behind his back and rose on his toes. He said, &quot;So you like to run the tap for a while ?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Yes, Father.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And why&rsquo;s that?&quot; <br><br>&quot;The pipes here are lead. And lead is poison. Not good for the brain.&quot; <br><br>&quot;The Romans used a lot of lead piping,&quot; said Fr Barney, winking at Charlie. &quot;Smart boys, the Romans. They didn&rsquo;t do too badly.&quot; <br><br>&quot;No  - you&rsquo;re right, Father. But maybe it&rsquo;s what destroyed their Empire,&quot;  said Hugo. &quot;Being reared to drink poison helps no-one.&quot; <br><br>Fr Barney sucked in his cheeks and rolled his eyes. <br><br>&quot;I  need a whiskey after that slap down.&quot; Aunt Cissy moved to the sideboard  where the bottle was kept . &quot;Cissy, fill her up with water, lead or no  lead. Will anybody join me? What - no takers, at all?&quot; <br><br>He held up his glass. &quot;To Mister Tully here. God guide your golden boots.&quot; <br><br>Granda came downstairs and had to push the door open against the people inside. <br><br>&quot;What am I missing?&quot; he said. <br><br>&quot;A drink,&quot; said Fr Barney. Granda looked around in mock amazement. <br><br>&quot;He&rsquo;s  getting no drink at this time of the day,&quot; said Aunt Cissy. Granda was  still wearing his dark Sunday suit and the waistcoat with his  watch-chain looped across it. On his way to mass he wore a black bowler  hat. <br><br>&quot;It&rsquo;s getting a bit crowded in here,&quot; Granda said, looking  around the room. &quot;Reminds me of the day McCormack sang in our house in  Antrim. There was that many in the room we had to open the windows so&rsquo;s  the neighbours outside could hear him.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Count John McCormack?&quot; said Charlie Tully. <br><br>&quot;The very one.&quot; <br><br>&quot;How did the maestro end up in your house?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Oh, he was with Terry there, some organ recital.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And what did he sing? &quot; <br><br>&quot;Everything. Everything but the kitchen sink. Down by the Sally Gardens, I hear you calling me.&quot; <br><br>&quot;It was some show,&quot; said Terry Lennon, putting his head back as if listening to it again. <br><br>&quot;Would you credit that?&quot; said Charlie. &quot;I met a man who knows Count John McCormack.&quot; <br><br>There was a strange two note cry from the hallway, &quot;Yoo- hoo.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Corinna,&quot; said Cissy and pulled a face. The door was pushed open and Corinna and her sister, Dinky, stood there. <br><br>&quot;Full house the day,&quot; said Corinna. She eased herself into the room. Dinky remained just outside. <br><br>&quot;The house is crowded out, even to the door,&quot; said my father. <br><br>&quot;Is  there any chance of borrowing an egg, Cissy. I&rsquo;d started the baking  before I checked.&quot; Cissy went into the kitchen and came back with an egg  which she handed to Corinna. <br><br>&quot;Thanks a million. You&rsquo;re too  good.&quot; Corinna stood with the egg between her finger and thumb. &quot;What&rsquo;s  the occasion?&quot; She vaguely indicated the full room. <br><br>&quot;Charlie  Tully,&quot; said Cissy. &quot;This is Corinna Coyle. And her sister Dinky.&quot; Cissy  pointed over heads in the direction of the front hall. Dinky went up on  her toes and smiled. <br><br>&quot;A good looking man,&quot; said Corinna. <br><br>&quot;Worth &pound;8,000 in transfer fees,&quot; said Fr Barney. <br><br>&quot;He&rsquo;s above rubies, Cissy. Above rubies.&quot; And away she went with her egg and her sister. <br><br>&quot;So,&quot; said Granda, &quot;will we ever see Charlie Tully playing again on this side of the water?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Maybe.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Internationals,&quot; said Hugo. <br><br>&quot;But  it&rsquo;s not the same thing,&quot; said Granda, &quot;as watching a man playing week  in, week out. That&rsquo;s the way you get the whole story.&quot; <br><br>&quot;There&rsquo;s talk of a charity game with the Belfast boys later in the year,&quot; said Charlie. <br><br>&quot;Belfast  Celtic and Glasgow Celtic?&quot; Granda was now leaning forward with his  elbows on the table. &quot;There wouldn&rsquo;t be a foul from start to finish.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Where&rsquo;d  be the fun in that?&quot; said Fr Barney. &quot;Cissy, I&rsquo;ll have another one of  those.&quot; Cissy went to the sideboard and refilled the glass. <br><br>&quot;Remember  you&rsquo;ve a car to drive.&quot; Barney ignored her and pointed at my father,  &quot;Johnny there would design you a programme for that game. For nothing.  He&rsquo;s a good artist.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Like yourself Charlie,&quot; said Granda. <br><br>&quot;Is that the kinda thing you do?&quot; Charlie said. <br><br>&quot;Yeah  sure,&quot; said my father. Barney started mock shouting as if he was  selling programmes outside the ground. Some of his whisky slopped over  the rim of the glass as he waved his arms. My father smiled. <br><br>&quot;Have you been somewhere - before here?&quot; <br><br>&quot;On a Sunday morning?&quot; <br><br>Barney  looked over to Charlie Tully. &quot;Johnny does work for every charity in  the town. The YP Pools, the St Vincent de Paul, the parish, even the  bloody bishop - no friend of mine - as you well know - his bloody nibs.  Your Grace.&quot; He gave a little mock inclination of the head. Cissy  ordered Brendan out of his chair and told Barney to sit and not be  letting the side down. <br><br>&quot;So Charlie,&quot; said Granda, &quot;the truth from the insider - is there no chance of Belfast Celtic starting up again?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Not that I know of.&quot; <br><br>&quot;We gave in far too easily. In my day when somebody gave you a hiding, you fought back.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Aye, it&rsquo;s all up when your own side makes you the scapegoat,&quot; said Aunty Cissy. <br><br>&quot;I mean to say,&quot; Granda&rsquo;s voice went up in pitch. &quot;What were they thinking of ?&quot; <br><br>&quot;The game of shame.&quot; <br><br>&quot;A crowd of bigots.&quot; <br><br>&quot;They came streaming on to that pitch like .. like .. bloody Indians.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Indians are good people,&quot; said Hugo. <br><br>&quot;&hellip;and  they kicked poor Jimmy Jones half to death. Fractured his leg in five  places. And him one of their own. It ended his career.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Take it easy, Da,&quot; said Fr Barney and slapped the arm of his chair. <br><br>&quot;You were at the game?&quot; said Charlie Tully. <br><br>&quot;Aye  and every other one they&rsquo;ve ever played,&quot; said Granda. &quot;I don&rsquo;t know  what to do with myself on a Saturday afternoon now. I sometimes slip up  to Cliftonville&rsquo;s ground but it&rsquo;s not the same thing. <br><br>Solitude.  It&rsquo;s well named.&quot; Granda was shaking his head from side to side. &quot;I just  do not understand it. What other bunch of people would do it? The board  of directors,&quot; he spat the words out. <br><br>&quot;The team gets chased off  the pitch, its players get kicked half to death and what do they do?  OK, we&rsquo;re going to close down the club. That&rsquo;ll teach you. In the name  of Jesus&hellip;&quot; Granda stopped talking because he was going to cry. He looked  hard at the top of the window and he kept swallowing. Again and again.  Nobody else said anything. &quot;Why should we be the ones sacrificed? Is  there no-one on our side who has any guts at all?&quot; <br><br>&quot;Take it  easy,&quot; said my father. &quot;They have the sectarian poison in them.&quot; He  reached out and put his hand on Granda&rsquo;s shoulder. Shook him a little.  Granda recovered himself a bit and said, &quot;It would put you in mind of  the man who got a return ticket for the bus - then he had a row with the  conductor - so, to get his own back, he walked home. That&rsquo;ll teach  them.&quot; <br><br>There were smiles at that. The room became silent. <br><br>&quot;It was a great side,&quot; said Charlie Tully at last. &quot;Kevin McAlinden, Johnny Campbell, Paddy Bonnar &hellip;&quot; <br><br>&quot;Aye.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And what a keeper Hugh Kelly was.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Aye and Bud Ahern&hellip;&quot; <br><br>&quot;Billy McMillan and Robin Lawlor.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Of course.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Jimmy Jones and Eddie McMorran and who else?&quot; <br><br>&quot;You&rsquo;ve left out John Denver.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And the captain, Jackie Vernon.&quot; <br><br>&quot;And yourself, Charlie,&quot; said Granda. &quot;Let&rsquo;s not forget yourself, maestro.&quot; <br><br>Sometime  later that year - which became known to Granda as &quot;the year Charlie  Tully called&quot; as opposed to &quot;the year McCormack sang in the house in  Antrim&quot; - I noticed drawings and sketches of my father&rsquo;s lying about the  house. They were of players in Celtic hoops in the act of kicking or  heading a ball. Their bodies were tiny but their heads were made from  oval photos of the real players. <br><br>It was many years later - half a  century, in fact - before I would remember these drawings again. My  father died when I was 12 and my mother was so distraught that she threw  out all his things.<br><br>If she was reminded of him she would break down and weep, so every scrap of paper relating to him had to be sacrificed. <br><br>Recently,  I was in Belfast and I wondered if there might be a copy of the  programme lying around Smithfield market. I found a small shop entirely  devoted to football programmes, so I went in and told them what I was  looking for - a Belfast Celtic v Glasgow Celtic match programme from the  early 1950s. <br><br>The man looked at me and said: &quot;Put it this way. I&rsquo;m a collector and I&rsquo;ve never seen one.&quot; <br><br>I was disappointed. Then he said, &quot;If you do catch up with it, you&rsquo;ll pay for it.&quot; <br><br>&quot;How much?&quot; I was thinking in terms of 20 or 30 quid. <br><br>&quot;A thousand pounds. Minimum.&quot; <br><br>I&rsquo;m  not really impressed by that kind of rarity value - but in this case I  thought, &quot;Good on you, Johnny. After all the work for charity.&quot; If that  price is accurate I don&rsquo;t want to own the real thing - but I wouldn&rsquo;t  mind seeing a photocopy. A photocopy would be good. Above rubies, in  fact.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%">  <a href="/page/Tully%2C+Charlie#editTableCell" target="_self"><br></a></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Tully after Celtic</h3>The  career of Cheeky Charlie Tully was one spent in the brightest of lime  lights and when he made his final tearful, bow at the Celtic Supporters  Rally at St Andrew&rsquo;s Hall in November 1959, the 3,000 Celtic fans  cheering him to the rafters, as he prepared to leave the Hoops, were  under no illusions &ndash; they knew Charlie would stay close to the  headlines, no matter where he went.<br><br>Cork in Ireland would be the  first destination and as Charlie prepared to line out at Hibernians as  player/manager. Cork&rsquo;s Chairman, John Crowley, was hoping his new  player/manager&rsquo;s boots would still have a sprinkling of Tully magic to  help his team make an imprint on the Irish football scene.<br><br>And he  didn&rsquo;t have to wait long for the magic to arrive, as Hibs hurtled  towards the FAI cup final in 1960, only for a fall at the final hurdle  against Dublin&rsquo;s Shelbourne. <br><br>In March of that year, the Mardyke  club also recorded their biggest ever win, firing 10 goals past a  helpless Transport club, as spectators and reporters and news men  swelled the gates.<br><br>Three future Lisbon Lions would feature in  Cork in May 1960, as a youthful Celtic side played an exhibition match  against Charlie&rsquo;s new club. Celtic Chairman Robert Kelly&rsquo;s fondness for  Tully hadn&rsquo;t waned and, even after a strained finale to his career in  Glasgow, he was happy to be in Charlie&rsquo;s company once again.<br><br>A wonderful black and white image of the day captures the two sides and the magic of the time. <br><br>As  Bertie Auld, John Clark and Neilly Mochan crouch in the front row of  the lineup, standing at the back is a 20 year old Billy McNeil, with his  arm draped lovingly around his hero, the ageing Charles Patrick Tully.<br><br>Despite  his advancing years, Charlie played on, until, on January 8, 1964, he  accepted a managerial post closer to home, with Irish football minnows  Bangor FC, based in the seaside town on the north coast of County Down.<br><br>Before  Charlie arrived for his first of two spells at Clandeboye Park, Bangor  had finished joint bottom of the league with Cliftonville. They were  also without a home win all season - their record reading two draws and  six defeats as Tully rolled into town.<br><br>Things were so bad Charlie  quipped; &ldquo;Even the seagulls have deserted Clandeboye!&rdquo;, but on a  shoestring budget, and with his famous Irish blarney, Charlie began to  set the league alight.<br>He used his personal magnetism to lure very  useful players, including a famous ex-Celt in Willie Fernie, along with  Italian-born winger Stevie Ginalti, also from Glasgow. <br><br>Both were  drawn to an unremarkable club to play for a remarkable man and Tully  also drew handy Dubliners Sonny Rice and Eamonn Farrell.<br><br>Life was  tough in the trenches and the ever-enthusiastic and sometimes volatile  Tully could reach a volcanic boiling point in the dugout. He wore his  heart on his sleeve, abhorred anything less than a professional approach  to football and was in constant &#39;hot water&#39; with the powerful figures  who ran the Irish Football Association and the Irish Football League. <br><br>On  one occasion, Charlie burst onto the field of play to remonstrate with a  referee, earning him a red card and a heavy league fine.<br><br>His  player and assistant manager Jim Emery once remarked &lsquo;In modern day  football, Charlie would be banned every other week because he always  called a spade a spade!&rdquo;<br><br>On another occasion, he fired a  broadside at the make-up of the Northern Ireland international squad,  made flippant pokes at both soccer commentator Ronald Rosser and IFA  President Harry Cavan, leading him again to be hauled over the coals by  the IFA. <br><br>He was a reporter&#39;s dream and a snappers delight,  perching his trademark Trilby hat at a jaunty angle to match his  carefully created &lsquo;Cheeky&rsquo; persona for the photographers to aim their  lenses at and his Bangor team, affectionately dubbed the &lsquo;Seagulls&rsquo;  regularly made the headlines.<br><br>Irish news reporter Denis O&rsquo;Hara,  who would later be Charlie&rsquo;s Ghost Writer at the morning daily, would  make occasional trips from Belfast to Bangor, reporting on how Tully and  the minnows were progressing. <br><br>He recalls how he once saw Charlie barracking a player for hitting a corner kick wide &ndash; a cardinal crime in Charlie&rsquo;s eyes. <br><br>After  two years, he moved inland to manage Portadown FC before returning to  Bangor in January 1968 for an historic managerial spell.<br><br>On May 22, 1970, the madcap Messiah led Bangor to the Promised Land by winning their first senior trophy.<br><br>It  took four collisions with north Down neighbours Ards at Solitude (three  1-1 draws, then a 3-2 win) to clinch the County Antrim Shield. <br><br>One  euphoric Bangor youth, clamouring for Charlie&#39;s autograph afterwards,  cried out to Charlie: &quot;Mr Tully, does this win get us into Europe?&quot; <br><br>The reply was typically Charlie Tully, as he chuckled: &quot;No son, it doesn&#39;t even get us into County Antrim!&quot; <br><br>Seven months later, Bangor also bagged the old City Cup, proving Tully&rsquo;s magic hadn&rsquo;t deserted him.<br><br>Despite  his successes at Bangor and Cork Hibs, Belfast Celtic were Charlie&rsquo;s  real passion and he always felt these roles were simply rehearsals for  the day the Grand Old Club would return to dominate Irish football with  him at the helm.<br><br>In an interview shortly before his death, in an  article in which he is pictured clasping the European Cup, he laid out  his plans for working with surviving board members to resurrect the  Belfast Stripes.<br><br>With typical Tully bluster, he declared that  within two years he would have Belfast Celtic in Europe, using a mix of  promising youngsters and veteran Glasgow Celts Bertie Auld, Stevie  Chalmers and Charlie Gallacher, whom he planned to recruit.<br><br>Charlie regularly crossed the Irish sea to visit the team and the city who had adopted him as a favourite son.<br><br>A  major Scottish travel company had secured Charlie&rsquo;s services for the  trip to Portugal in 1967 and as 30 plane loads of Scottish Celts  disembarked in Lisbon<b>, </b>there to greet them was their hero.<br><br>Denis  O&rsquo;Hara remembers him being mobbed by adoring fans and the adulation  extended to the official Celtic travelling party who immediately invited  Charlie to attend the pre-game meal in Estoril with the players and  their families, with a starry eyed Irish News journalist in tow.<br><br>After  the victory, Charlie was asked for his thoughts on the game and one  journalist brazenly asked Tully whether he would have made the team on  that hot night in Lisbon.<br><br>With typical Irish<b> </b>charm and a  fair degree of modesty, Charlie responded, &lsquo;Ah now, sure maybe I could  have taken the corners&rsquo;, with the memories of Charlie scoring directly  from the set-pieces flooding back to the hacks.<br><br>He continued to  follow Celtic and in 1970, it seemed certain that the European Cup would  once again land on Scottish shores and following the 1967 European Cup  milestone, there was high hopes of a second success. <br><br>On March 4,  1970, Celtic secured a quarter final tie against top Italian side  Fiorentina in what promised to be another nail-biting saga after a  coin-toss win over Benfica.<br><br>Charlie always had free access to  Celtic Park, thanks to his old colleague Sean Fallon of Sligo - Jock  Stein&#39;s shadow at Celtic &ndash; but on this night he stuck with O&rsquo;Hara,  standing at the back of the old claustrophobic and creaking Press area,  by pretending to be a Media Messenger.<br><br>During the action, Tully&rsquo;s  trademark Trilby took to the air, Frisbee-like, in a show of  instinctive emotion, landing on top of a crusty Italian soccer writer. <br><br>On  learning the culprit was none other than Charles Patrick, the same  journalist rose from behind his typewriter and asked for Tully&rsquo;s  autograph!<br><br>Beating the Italian giants propelled Celtic into a  mouth-watering war with Don Revie&#39;s white-shirted Leeds United, widely  regarded as one of the best teams in Europe. <br><br>Jock Stein&#39;s side  upset the script with an April semi-final, first leg, 1-0 win at Elland  Road and a ticket for Tully to gain entry to the Press Area of Hampden  Park was duly obtained.<br><br>The gripping second-leg showdown was a sensation!<br><br>Leeds  leveled through Billy Bremner and when John &#39;Yogi&#39; Hughes regained the  initiative for the Hoops, Charlie&rsquo;s trademark Trilby was once again  flung down the row of press seats, landing on the typewriter of the late  Hugh &#39;Sniffer&#39; Taylor of the <i>Daily Record</i>.<br><br>An agitated  pressman roared: &quot;Who did that?&quot;, but when Taylor looked round and saw  Charlie standing up and cheering the Hughes&rsquo; goal, he simply waved, and  shouted; &lsquo;Congratulations Charlie!&rdquo; <br><br>No doubt, the press men  remembered fondly how Charlie once kept them stocked with incredible  stories and they were willing to forgive him his boisterous love for the  club he adored.<br><br>Sadly, destiny would visit the Netherlands in  the final, as an up and coming Feyenoord side shocked a complacent  Celtic by taking the European Cup and breaking the hearts of Stein&rsquo;s  Glasgow Hoops.<br><br>In November 1970, when Celtic came to Dublin to  play Waterford United at Lansdowne Road in a European Cup tie, Charlie  was given a standing ovation during half-time, as Celtic fans spilled  onto the pitch to cheer their hero. <br><br>Charlie&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, Jim  Emery, remembers the eventful trip, and the supporters chanting  Charlie&rsquo;s name as he waved at them from the stand.<br><br>On the trip  home, they stopped at Drogheda in County Loth to visit a bar belonging  to the Irish Tenor Patrick O&rsquo;Hagan, who once filled the halls of the  Empire theatre in Glasgow.<br><br>Celtic fans returning from Lansdowne Road soon found out that Charlie had decamped and the bar was reduced to standing space. <br><br>At one point, Charlie was pulled from the pub on the shoulders of the throng to be carried along the street shoulder high.<br><br>At  closing time, O&rsquo;Hagan slipped Charlie back to his family home, where,  over nips of poit&iacute;n, the Tenor treated the gathering to songs from his  son Johnnie &ndash; who would later spellbind the entire continent of Europe,  as Johnnie Logan, with his hit single &lsquo;What&rsquo;s another year?&rsquo;<br><br>Unfortunately Charlie wouldn&rsquo;t see another year.<br><br>On  a Monday night deep in mid-summer 1971, as war raged all around the  Falls Road, Charlie took his usual place at the end of the counter at  Beacon&rsquo;s Bar, his closest friend and former Belfast Celtic team mate  Jackie Vernon at his side.<br><br>Glasgow Celtic had tried to buy  Jackie, back in the 40&rsquo;s, but refused to meet the asking fee, believing  &pound;10,000 was far too much to pay for a defender.<br><br>Instead, Robert Kelly parted with &pound;8,000 for a skinny wing wizard called Charles Patrick Tully and the rest is history.<br><br>As  the two men digested the weekend&rsquo;s football results and planned their  days ahead, neither realized they would never see each other again.<br><br>In  the early hours of Tuesday, July 27, Cheeky Charlie Tully, aged 47  years old, slipped quietly out of the world in his St James&rsquo;s Road home  with his sweetheart Carrie Harris by his side.<br><br>Telegrams flooded  in from around the world for the man who had died too soon and the front  pages of Ireland&rsquo;s tabloids replaced stories of bombs and bullets with  the sad tale of the loss of the Clown Prince of Football.<br><br>One  reporter, The Observer&rsquo;s John Rafferty, remarked sadly that; &ldquo;It was  strange (that Charlie) should have gone so peacefully. It was not his  way in life!&rdquo;<br><br>In Glasgow, Celtic were preparing their own  tributes and Jock Stein immediately informed the entire Celtic team that  each would be required immediately to travel to Belfast as an official  party to pay their respects to the man who saved Celtic when he dragged  them almost single handedly from the doldrums of the 1940&rsquo;s.<br><br>However,  in a town preparing to be convulsed by the ravages of internment  without trial, the Royal Ulster Constabulary had other ideas, informing  the Glasgow club that they would not be responsible for their safety  while entering through the Ports.<br><br>Stein did arrive in Belfast,  undeterred, with club Captain Billy McNeill and the two men shouldered  Charlie&rsquo;s remains with another Celtic legend, Bertie Peacock as it left  the church of Saint John the Evangelist, close to Charlie&rsquo;s home.<br><br>On  his final journey to Milltown Cemetery, where Celtic fans will gather  on the 40th anniversary of Charlie&rsquo;s death this year, Tully would have  no doubt revelled in the fact that he could still pull the biggest crowd  in town, even if he would have to accept that, in death, this was one  game he could never win..&hellip;..  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Obituary from The (London) Times, 29th July 1971</h2><div><img alt="aAfkjfp01fo1i-29491/loc432/863928142_Untitled_1_122_432lo.jpg" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/T8BsBuEx_0cYBEhR1cQ-ew203479" title="aAfkjfp01fo1i-29491/loc432/863928142_Untitled_1_122_432lo.jpg"></div><div class="va-bodytext"><b><br></b></div><b>A loyal servant</b><br><br>BORN   in Belfast, 1924, Charles Patrick Tully signed from Belfast Celtic in   June 1948. The names were the same, the strips were the same, even the   clubs&rsquo; aims were the same - to alleviate the plight of beleaguered   working-class Catholics. <br><br>Tully&rsquo;s reputation was cemented, as is   often the case with Celtic&rsquo;s greatest players, with an outstanding   performance against Rangers weeks after his arrival. This catapulted him   to the status of cult hero - &quot;Tully Mania&quot; gripped the East End.  Unlike  today&rsquo;s iconic players, who crave lucrative contracts and fan  adulation  in equal measure, Tully was a great servant of the club,  notching up  319 appearances and scoring 47 goals throughout an  illustrious 11-year  career. Most fans reckon he is the best inside-left  ever to have played  for the club. <br><br>His most notable game was in  a 1953 cup tie  against Falkirk at Brockville, when Tully scored not  one but two  sensational goals - direct from the corner kick. (Not even  Beckham could  bend it like that, twice.) Celtic were 3-2 winners. Tully  had already  scored a goal from the corner flag in 1952, when, earning  one of his ten  international caps for Northern Ireland against England,  he scored  another brace to level the match. It became something of a  habit. <br><br>In  the twilight of his career, Tully spent brief periods  on loan to  Stirling Albion before leaving Scotland in 1959. He  eventually went into  club management in Ireland. <br><br>Tully died in  1971 aged 47 at his  home in Belfast, a few months after playing in a  charity match at  Meadowbank. During the funeral procession, the Falls  Road was packed  with mourners from both sides of the sectarian and  footballing divide.<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Tully, Charlie - Pic" height="1759" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/ZuWk0iSwuv5jxykqd2MS8Q199490/GW402H1759" title="Tully, Charlie - Pic" width="402"></div></div>
