Some try to make out it was &pound;3.5m or &pound;4.5m but that is highly unlikely.<br><br>A natural right-back also capable of playing in midfield, versatile Efrain is extremely quick. Spotted by Lennon in a pre-World Cup friendly against England and perhaps earmarked to provide pace and directness down the right flank, conspicuously lacking at Celtic since the days of <a href="/page/Agathe%2C+Didier" target="_self">Didier Agathe</a>.<br><br>Juarez joined leading Mexican club UNAM as a 13-year-old. After winning the 2005 U17 World Cup he came to the attention of Barcelona and joined the Mexican colony at the Nou Camp in 2006. However, with Barcelona &#39;B&#39; spaces at a premium he was farmed out to CF Barbate in the Andalusian regional leagues for 2006-07. This was punctuated by qualifiers for the U20 World Cup in Canada that summer, at which Mexico reached the quarter finals but Scotland bombed spectacularly.<br><br>Trials at Everton and AEK Athens followed in the second half of 2007, but were scuppered by work permit and other foreign player restrictions. So Efrain headed home and signed a one year deal with original club UNAM, spending the 2008 Clausura playing reserve team football with the club&#39;s &quot;Morelas&quot; side. Thereafter he was promoted to the senior team and was a regular until his departure, picking up a Clausura 2009 winner&#39;s medal. His full international debut came on 28 June 2009 and he had racked up more than 20 caps within a year to give indication of the confidence in him.<br><br>At Celtic, Juarez hit the ground running, initially being deployed in midfield and for a few games looked the sort of midfielder who could get in front of the strikers and score goals, something that had been missing since <a href="/page/Petrov%2C+Stiliyan" target="_self">Stillian Petrov</a> moved to Aston Villa. Unfortunately this would not last long, with Juarez losing form and his place in the team. One story posts that his loss of form occurred around the time he was disciplined by the Mexican national team for his part in organising an unauthorised post-World Cup party. <br><br>A common belief is that after <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> were out of Europe, after humiliating defeats to Braga (European Cup) and Utrecht (Europa League), his head went down and he wasn&#39;t interested! Doesn&#39;t speak too well of him if wholly true. A shame as he started so well in those matches. A quick favourite with the support with some good performances when the team was unsettled and working under rookie manager Neil Lennon. It wasn&#39;t to last long and that was a disappointment.<br><br>For the remainder of the 2010/11 season Juarez would remain a peripheral figure at Celtic, unable to establish himself in the team despite availability problems at various stages in both midfield and defence. The season would end on a more positive note for Juarez, as he was an integral part of the Mexican team which would win the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, coming from 2 - 0 down to beat the USA 3 - 2 in the final. This caught the eye of clubs abroad, and unsurprisingly he left on loan to Real Zaragoza on 26 July 2011 in hope for a full contract. <br><br>A good player and likely <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">the Celtic</span> <span class="diffAdd">support </span>never saw the best of him, but he should have put more effort into his time here. Likely didn&#39;t realise that <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> had so many good midfielders to take his place (surprisingly he was way back in the queue for a place), so the only opportunities if any were to be as a right-back. Overall, he wasted his opportunity with us.<br><br>He was back at Celtic in January 2012 after his loan move was cut short, but still no room for a first team regular start. No chance still in midfield, but <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> had a better developer in Matthews at right-back but it was embarrassing for Juarez to find he was even behind the much maligned Cha Du-Ri for the role. A token appearance at the end of the season was all he was worthy of.<br><br>In June 2012, Mexican side Club America announced they had bought Juarez. It was all over.<br><br>  Juarez&#39;s failure at Celtic is not one that you can pin down to a single reason alone, but whatever the points the buck stops with him. He joins a very long line of Mexican players who have failed in Europe but can you argue that he had it a little easier at Celtic in the SPL compared to La Liga? He was more experienced than most of his compatriots as well who had come over to Europe. <br><br>  Initially it seemed he had the making of a cult player but in time found himself cut out. His failure elsewhere on loan doesn&#39;t help his case for his own defence, but does ask questions of what difference he was expected to bring to any of the clubs.  <br><br>  It&#39;s too late now. We do wish him the best but in all honesty he was leaving whilst being way behind even juniors in the pecking order for first team games and no one at Celtic was too concerned about his departure. It was on the cards for too long, and Juarez had seemed to do too little enough to challenge the situation. <br><br>  Promised a lot but not to be. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes</h3><font color="#000000">&quot;I had very little time at the club, and in my third or fourth game they had already invented that song for me and sang it any time they could.

Juarez, who made three appearances for Mexico during the World Cup finals, will undergo a medical in Seattle whilst documentation is completed. He played for Spanish giants Barcelona&#39;s B-team between 2006 and 2008, and helped Pumas reach fourth place in La Primera Division before heading for South Africa. Celtic manager Neil Lennon told the BBC: &quot;We are very close to signing him and hopefully over the next few days we&#39;ll have something on that. &ldquo;We&#39;re not paying massive money for him. &quot;He&#39;s got great energy, is really comfortable on the ball and works really hard off the ball. &quot;He&#39;s a very fit lad and I think his style will suit us, he&#39;s a hardy little guy - he can put his foot in. &quot;I saw Juarez playing against England at Wembley before the World Cup and just kept an eye on him. &quot;I thought he looked decent there and in the World Cup, and when the opportunity came up, we watched him again and again and asked if he would fit in to what we wanted to do here.&rdquo; Lennon has been ringing the changes at Parkhead this summer, signing South Korean right-back Cha Du-Ri from Freiburg, former Cardiff midfielder Joe Ledley and ex-Aberdeen defender Charlie Mulgrew.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><div class="content-group"><h3>   Celtic misfit Efrain Juarez joins Real Zaragoza on loan           </h3>BBC<br>Page last updated at 16:51 GMT, Tuesday, 26 July 2011 17:51 UK</div> 	                   <div>        	                              Jurez was on the sidelines for much of last season with Celtic<br><br>Mexico international  Efrain Juarez has joined Real Zaragoza on a season-long loan after  failing to hold down a regular first-team spot with Celtic.<br><br>         The 22-year-old made 11 starts and nine appearances off the bench after being bought for &pound;3m from Pumas last summer.<br><br>         His move followed his appearances at the World Cup and this summer he helped his country win the Gold Cup.<br><br>         But Juarez, who can play at right-back or in midfield, has now been snapped up by former Mexico coach Javier Aguirre.<br><br>         Aguirre led Zaragoza to 13th place in La Liga last season.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5  WPC-edit-border-rows  WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3> <h3>   </h3>             </div><h3>Celtic misfit Efrain Juarez: No-one knows why my move to Parkhead didn&#39;t work out   	</h3> 	 	Jun 10 2012 	Sunday Mail<br>  	 	 	MEXICAN misfit Efrain Juarez last night revealed even Dermot Desmond couldn&rsquo;t work out why he flopped at Celtic.<br> 	The 24-year-old left Parkhead last week after a disastrous two-year spell to return to his homeland with Club America.<br> 	Juarez was mystified as to why his move to Celts didn&rsquo;t work out and claimed majority shareholder Desmond shared his thoughts.

What did it mean to you, does that make you proud? <br><br>It is one of the most beautiful experiences I&#39;ve had in my life, being the first Mexican to play in the SPL and for Celtic, which is the most important team in Scotland and one of the most important in Europe filled me with pride and satisfaction. I had a good time, I was able to play in the Champions League and Europa League, and I scored in my second and third games. People treated me in the best way, I am very proud to have been in Celtic for the tradition they have. I had the opportunity to go to Ireland, where people are crazy about Celtic. I also had the opportunity to go on tour to the United States, where they know Celtic is a Scottish team, but the reality is that it also has Irish roots, and there are plenty of Irish people worldwide. The support of the people was impressive, and the affection they showed towards me at all times as well. <br><br>What moment do you remember the most from your time at Celtic? <br><br>I think when I scored the goals in big games and when the stadium began to sing me a song, they invented a song and sang it whenever I played, every time I started a game or when I did something good. Impressive, I had very little time at the club, and in my third or fourth game they had already invented that song for me and sang it any time they could. I remember that a lot and it gives me goosebumps. It is one of the things that I am going to keep forever. Until today, when I have had the opportunity to return to Scotland and I come across Celtic supporters, they sing me the same song because it&#39;s also very catchy and it is very good. <br><br>How would you compare the style of play in Scotland, to the one practiced in Mexico? <br><br>It is different. In Scotland there is a very competitive league, physically very strong, and technically good, but I think the greatest strength of the Scottish Premiership compared to the Mexican league is the physical aspect. They are always looking to score, no matter when it is, the team may be leading or losing 5-0 and they always look for a goal. In Mexico they always worry about the way to score, always trying to get out playing with the ball. Back in Scotland that does not matter, all that matters is to score when you get the chance, to move forward you have a chance, and if not they are not happy. <br><br>What was your most valuable lesson during your time in Scottish football? <br><br>I had many as I grew up a lot as a person and as a player. The experience of playing in such competitive football, trying every day to earn a spot made me grow in every sense, as a person, seeing other things, the Scottish culture, and the Celtic family. When I first came to the United States for the pre-season with the team, and a lot of Irish and Scots will tell you the story of Celtic, it is more than a football club for them because Celtic was founded by Marist Brothers to help other people, to create a fund to help people emigrating from Ireland to Scotland because of the hunger problem at the time. All these people telling you that the love of Celtic is in their DNA, in their blood. I think that without the Celtic, their families would not have survived and they would have not existed. They helped their ancestors to succeed in difficult times and for that, they are forever grateful. This pre-season I was in Cancun with CF Monterrey and there are a lot of Celtic supporters on holiday there. They remembered me, and told me everything I&#39;m just telling you now, I have the fortune of being remembered for the time spent at the club and they still recognise me. The funniest and most beautiful is that they ask for pictures, and being there you realise about their Celtic tattoos or that they cover their body with things related to the Celtic. I think that has a value, going beyond a simple fan, it is passion and appreciation for the club. <br><br>Which Celtic player do you remember the most and why? <br><br>Many, I spent much time with Scott Brown; he is a great guy, great captain and a great leader. With Samaras, we shared many things, also a great guy, very good person. I do not really have one in particular. I think I was fortunate to be in a very healthy, very good club, they welcomed me in the best manner, but specifically with Brownie, with Samaras, with Anthony Stokes, Mikael Lustig, Adam Matthews, many people, the goalkeepers Fraser Forster, Łukasz Załuska. And then there was Emilio Izaguirre, because we arrived at the same time and we were the only two Latinos who spoke Spanish, we got along very well, he&rsquo;s also a great guy, great player and a great person. The truth is I have very fond memories of all the people there, not only players but also the coaching staff. Neil Lennon, he did very well for Celtic as a player and as a coach as well. Passionate about the club, he could give his life for the club, and many other people, John Park, Peter Lawwell, the scouts, people in the kitchen, and the groundsstaff. I remember perfectly each of them and beyond a club; they are a family that help each other at all times. <br><br>You are one of the few Mexican players that have been involved in qualifying games of the UEFA Champions and Europa League. What is your experience from these matches? <br><br>As a little boy, I always dreamt of playing in European completion one day, and fortunately I have been able not only to play in them, but to score twice in Celtic Park, with people chanting my name. These are moments that will remain, matches that are important for the club and obviously personally as well. These are goals I had, and I thank God for achieving them. <br><br>Players like Messi and Xavi have said that Celtic fans are unparalleled, and that Celtic Park offers the best playing atmosphere in Europe. Can you tell us in detail how does it feel to play in Paradise? <br><br>The best! There is not a moment when fans are not supporting, the team may be losing and they keep singing, chanting, and supporting them. Or they may be winning 5-0 and fans continue with the same attitude, no matter the match, the stadium is filled with over 60,000 people, an incredible crowd. Wherever we were going to play in the Champions League, Europa League or friendly matches outside of Scotland, there were many people, there is an impressive fan base at Celtic Park. I have been in important stadia, against important teams, but to compare it with Celtic Park is impossible. <br><br>You scored twice at Celtic Park, can you describe both goals? Which one is your favourite and why? <br><br>I have no favourite. The first was a header against Braga, we were tied 1-1, and Samaras crossed the ball, I came by surprise and put it in with the head. The second was two weeks later in the Europa League qualifiers. It was the first leg at Celtic Park against Utrecht, and I opened the score around the 20th minute, they passed to me while I was entering the box, I controlled the ball, faced the goalkeeper and finished it. It was an important game, full stadium for a Europa League qualifier, awesome in every way. A unique experience, I remember that moment like it was yesterday. <br><br>Celtic Soccer Academy Coaches will be in Mexico City delivering a youth camp during the first week of August. Do you think other Mexican players might follow your footsteps and play for the Scottish champions in the future? <br><br>I think so. Mexican players are increasingly in the eyes of major European clubs, and why not think about Celtic, which is an important team and has already experience with Mexican people. Why not think that young Mexican players can do well and that Celtic can recruit them at some point. <br><br>Do you have any regrets from your time at Celtic? <br><br>No, nothing. I remember everything I lived perfectly, I have no regrets. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br></div>
