Transferred in from Midyjylland (Denmark) he seemed to have arrived on relatively economic terms, yet it became partly obvious why when the repeat injuries set in. <br><br>This big brute of a player was a welcome throw back for most supporters. A strong well built centre half, he was not afraid of old fashioned tackling and gritty performances. Quickly with his jovial persona he became a favoured figure amongst the support, and his performances were impressing from early on. Albeit he had a poor debut as Celtic were unceremoniously dumped out the league cup losing 3-1 to Ross County.<br><br>As a person, Sviatchenko was a very affable person, taking time to do press conferences, post-match interviews, supporters&rsquo; nights and fundraisers. He did more than most &amp; seemed to do it because he wanted to, rather than because management told him to or for contractual obligations. Some were already pencilling him in as having the makings of an outstanding Captain, which was quite a leap in the early days. His backroom team were active on Social Media, and as much as he liked to play the character on social media, he actually came across as a very smart and down to earth young man, escaping any of the media&#39;s obvious traps.<br><br>Widely respected, his family got involved, with a sister involved in Celtic related charity work and then his father selling on some limited edition Lisbon Lion themed jackets (not sure who actually bought any of them), regarded as a silly cash-in by some.<br><br>As a player he was great at winning headers, and did a lot of unheralded work which could go unnoticed, and covered well for his fellow defenders when called on. He definitely got what it was like to play for Celtic, and we respected that. He was not a ball playing, centre back, and needed to be more comfortable on the ball. A bad habit of diving into tackles didn&rsquo;t help with losing some silly free-kicks, although his record does not show a record of yellow cards given, and as he was a little flat-footed, he was at time easily beaten by pacy strikers. Even when he lost some form but you could always still see his effort.<br><br>An aggressive tackler and hard trier but awareness, positioning, speed, aerial strength needed further work. He seemed to have hit a glass ceiling, and that was concerning in a side trying to push on to another level under Rodgers. He was by any measure as good a centre-half as the bulk of players Celtic had over the past decade or so, but Celtic were now stepping up, and he was struggling to move up with the club. <br><br>When he lost some confidence and form, the support could be unduly critical which didn&rsquo;t help, but in truth he kept going. <br><br>His early level of performance had been overstated by certain sections of the support and the media &ndash; bolstered by a goal v Sevco, but he had come across as an engaging and interesting character, which probably did him no harm and helped him to cultivate a positive profile. At a time when the first team was at a low as the Ronny Deila management experience was floundering, Sviatchenko was a positive note amongst all the gloom.<br><br>He was developing and shored up an often criticised defence. No denying the quality of individuals but as a unit it wasn&rsquo;t working, but Sviatchenko in the early days was excused any criticism, and the support saw his talent.<br><br>As Rodgers took over, Sviatchenko had settled down as a regular in the incredible 2016-17 &lsquo;<a href="/page/The+Invincibles" target="_self">InVIncibles</a>&rsquo; season after an early injury and was playing relatively well against the general opposition he faced. Domestically he fared well, and was a regular throughout much of the incredible season. When paired with Simunovic, the first team had a great central defence and with Kolo Toure assisting in the mix, the squad that season had a fair mixture of central defenders.<br><br>He was clearly very proud of his sole goal in the 2016/17 season v Ross County in Dec 2016, jovially remarking:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;The ball came across and it was fairly long distance, but what a strike. The legend says it&#39;s still travelling.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>However, following this moment, rather than progress he seemed to have hit his peak. A poor game followed v Sevco, in a 2-1 victory and he was marked as responsible for the conceded goal by many of the Celtic support. <br><br>There had already been shown to be some glaring weaknesses against tougher sides, for example he was found out a bit in the Champions League - particularly Borussia M and Manchester City, but there was room for development. Yet after the turn of the year, from January 2017 his value was depreciating for some reason. Maybe he had hit a glass ceiling, and as Simunovic finally began to show his own quality, Sviatchenko was now falling behind. <br><br>So it was no surprise that the manager looked at alternative options in the winter break and gave somebody else a chance. The resurgence in form by Boyata, who had previously been heavily written off, gave Sviatchenko a challenge which he didn&rsquo;t likely expect either, and likely added concerns for his future whereas before he was mostly unchallenged for a first team place. This again likely affected his form, but he was still a regular in the first team.<br><br>He stated his (mild) frustration to the media, but nothing serious, just as with any player they want greater certainty (as is only natural). In fairness to the manager, Sviatchenko needed to be part of a rotation system. With Celtic in Europe, and three domestic cups, the season was heavy, and defenders often get injured easily through the challenges. He may have stated some frustration at the rotation, but really that was no different to anyone else, and there was no denying that Simunovic was the number one centre-half by a long way.<br><br>In truth, whilst the First Team was hitting the heights, the defence was still causing concerns, and the combined unit didn&rsquo;t convince everyone. It was probably one of Rodgers&rsquo; biggest concerns, and the drafting in of Kolo Toure in season 2016/17 had only just temporarily shored up the central defence without whom likely Celtic would never had made the Champions League. <br><br>As he fell down the rankings, he was loaned out in Jan 2018 to FC Midtjylland but this was partly as a sale wasn&#39;t forthcoming. Following a very successful spell where he helped them to the Danish league title, he was sold for &pound;1m to the club.</div><div><br>There&#39;s no denying that as a person he was personable, popular and genuine, but he was hitting a glass ceiling, and as Rodgers was setting his sights high, Sviatchenko wasn&#39;t seen to be part of that path. He did much right but the odd errors could be costly, although should be clearly noted that he was not by any means a poor defender at all and his colleagues did make similar costly errors too. <br><br>Some comment that he was simply not a Brendan Rodgers type player, but he still managed a wealth of games under him. Celtic continued to have centre-half problems throughout the 2017-18 season, and even whilst away there were the odd call from some that he should return and was better than the incumbents. Few were convinced this was a solution.<br><br>He played a good role in the wonderful treble winning &#39;<a href="/page/The+Invincibles" target="_self">InVIncibles</a>&#39; season that saw Celtic go undefeated domestically. For that he deserves much respect. He came and integrated very well socially with the supporters, a much welcome sight. There were also plenty who wished he could have stayed for longer.<br><br>We hope him the best. A likeable, affable character and a fair player too.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b></div><div>[....]</div></div></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes</h3>&quot;I clearly remember when I came to Celtic I said I wanted to be  remembered and I wanted to be part of something greater.&quot; <br><b>Erik  Sviatchenko on why he came to Celtic (2016) <br></b><br>&quot;I am part of history now.

Sviatchenko</h3>http://www.celticfc.net/news/9904<br>By: Paul Cuddihy on 17 Jan, 2016 18:30<br><br>CELTIC are delighted to announce that Erik Sviatchenko has joined the club on a four-and-a-half year deal from FC Midtjylland.<br><br>The highly-rated Danish internationalist, who had attracted a lot of interest from a number of top clubs, chose the Scottish champions and becomes the latest addition to Ronny Deila&rsquo;s squad.<br><br>Erik has already gained four caps for Denmark and scored one goal against France in October last year.<br><br>And the 24-year-old defender also helped FC Midtjylland reach the last 32 of this season&rsquo;s UEFA Europa League, where they will play Manchester United next month.<br><br>But Erik has opted to join Celtic and help the Hoops in their bid for the treble in this campaign.<br><br>Speaking exclusively to the official website, Erik said: &ldquo;I am so happy to join Celtic, such a fantastic club and such a huge name in football. This is a club with a wonderful pedigree and a massive support.<br><br>&ldquo;I will do everything I can to bring success to Celtic. It means so much to me to join a winning club, to join a club that goes for and wins trophies and wants to play in the Champions League. <br><br>&ldquo;I have had a taste of winning with Midtjylland and I want more of this feeling at Celtic. When you play football, you want to be remembered for winning and I want to be remembered as a winner with Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;I know we have a squad of really talented players and I can&rsquo;t wait to get started, team up with them and get to work.&rdquo;  <br>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/kds/widget/genericvideo/261bc452a49124c99973f30abfa84b26e655682a" width="560"></iframe><br><br><h3>Evening Times</h3>Dec 2016<br><a class="external" href="http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/celtic/14944270.Brendan_Rodgers_reveals_Erik_Sviatchenko__39_s_drive_for_improvement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/sport/celtic/14944270.Brendan_Rodgers_reveals_Erik_Sviatchenko__39_s_drive_for_improvement/</font></a><div>Brendan Rodgers has revealed the extent to which Erik Sviatchenko has gone to in order to improve his game this season.<br><br>The Danish stopper has establish a sound relationship with Jozo Simunovic at the heart of the Celtic defence this season and Rodgers has cited the player&rsquo;s attitude as pivotal to any developments he has made in his game.<br><br>Celtic have gone 778 domestic minutes without conceding a goal while Rodgers&rsquo; team are also on a 16-game unbeaten run. The pairing at the back in front of a revitalised Craig Gordon has lent an air of solidity to the team.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a boy that I&rsquo;ve got huge admiration for,&rdquo; said Rodgers of Sviatchenko. &ldquo;After every game he studies his own game and cuts how own parts &ndash; edits his own individual clips &ndash; and then comes to us. We then sit and look together. That&rsquo;s learning.<br><br>&ldquo;We sit and talk through his game - what he&rsquo;s done well and what he can improve on so he can take it into the next game.<br><br>&ldquo;So the improvement he&rsquo;s making is because of him. He&#39;s done that since he was in Denmark.<br><br>&quot;It was part of what they did there, he&#39;s felt the benefits of it, and he&#39;s continued with it. Self analysis is very important. Others will do it, look at things with the coaching staff.<br><br>&quot;But Erik does his own, and that&#39;s what you want as a coach. You want players who think about the game.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m lucky, I have a group here who are really thirsty to learn.<br><br>&quot;They want to be better and there is a lot of self improvement and reflection within them. And they&#39;re doing well.<br><br>&quot;But there is still a long way for us to go.&quot;<br><br>Simunovic is a more intriguing case. The Croatain under-21 internationalist impressed in sporadic bursts last term but was restricted to 18 appearances due to injury. A knee ligament problem curtailed his campaign at the end of January and it seemed that he was set to quit Celtic without making any significant impression when Torino moved for him in August.<br><br>That move fell through but the 22-year-old has been nursed through by Celtic this term. The players&rsquo; injury record means that Rodgers won&rsquo;t put too much physical pressure on the defender by asking him to play too frequently or to feature on plastic surfaces.<br><br>Yet, Simunovic&rsquo;s performances have marked him out for the Hoops this term.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one that was going to be the partnership if both were fit and well,&rdquo; said the Celtic manager. &ldquo;I think Erik&rsquo;s been brilliant as the season&rsquo;s gone on &ndash; how he&rsquo;s improving as a player and how he&rsquo;s developing.<br><br>&ldquo;Jozo is one, I said at the time, I hadn&rsquo;t seen him play. Not a lot of people had seen him play here. But I could just tell in training &ndash; I mentioned it a few months back &ndash; that he was a player.<br><br>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s 6ft 3in, fast, composed, aggressive. He&rsquo;s still young. He&rsquo;ll do something rash every now and then. Her looks scary and he is.<br><br>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve got a great guy in Kolo [Toure] there in behind them who can shepherd them and talk to them. He uses all his experience.<br><br>&ldquo;But those two are really strong. If they get the chance to play together consistently they give the team &ndash; along with the goalkeeper &ndash; a great backbone.<br><br>&ldquo;Slowly it&rsquo;s starting to turn. He played in the game on the Wednesday and did very well. His knee was clean afterwards so he could play in the final. We&rsquo;ve got a turnaround of Saturday, Tuesday, Friday. So we&rsquo;ll monitor it whether he plays in the three or two of the three. But both of them have been very good.&rdquo;</div><br><br><h3>Celtic defender Erik Sviatchenko speaks of frustration at being &#39;third choice&#39; centre half</h3>The big Danish stopper was back in the starting line-up for last night&#39;s draw with Partick Thistle but has been in and out of the starting XI since New Year.<br><div class="spoiler_toggle"><a class="external" href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-defender-erik-sviatchenko-speaks-10171332" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/celtic-defender-erik-sviatchenko-speaks-10171332</font></a></div><div class="spoiler"><br>ByRecord Sport Online<br><br>Erik Sviatchenko is frustrated at lack of starts for the first team<br>Celtic defender Erik Sviatchenko admits he has been left frustrated at his stop-start 2017 with the champions. <br>The Danish defender was back in the starting XI for last night&#39;s draw with Partick Thistle after missing out on the title-clinching thumping of Hearts on Sunday.<br><br>Sviatchenko has started just seven of Celtic &#39;s 13 matches since the Hogmanay win over Rangers. <br>And he says the situation is &quot;tiresome&quot; with Dedryck Boyata and Jozo Simunovic knocking him down to third choice centre half at Parkhead.<br><br>The resurgence of Dedryck Boyata has knocked Sviatchenko down the pecking order (Photo: SNS Group) <br>Sviatchenko, speaking to Danish news outlet BT : &ldquo;Since January, I have not figured as much as I&rsquo;d hoped. It is the first time in my career I have sat on the bench and not been selected, although in fact I&rsquo;m fit. <br>&ldquo;It is not ideal and it is a situation I must deal with. If Brendan Rodgers has decided that I am third choice, I will do everything to prove that I must be one of the two in the middle.<br>&ldquo;It is obviously a tiresome situation, especially when I&rsquo;ve had such a big role until July and then not be as dominant as I&rsquo;d expected. Right now it&rsquo;s frustrating.&rdquo;<br></div><br></div></div>
