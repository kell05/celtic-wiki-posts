All week across media, Celtic supporters and other journalists have been paying homage to the Lisbon Lions for their 50th anniversary of the greatest success in football.<br><br>Yet this weekend, Brendan Rodgers and his squad have achieved a landmark which will itself also be spoken about in honeyed tones in many years to come. An exceptional season with many wonderful high points.<br><br>The Celtic side today took us to the final minutes of the season, to the edge, and we all loved it (at the end that is but what a journey for 90 mins). <br><br>A lot of credit to Aberdeen who came out fighting and really put the scare in to Celtic, and if anything were unlucky not to at least scored twice, take the game into extra time, penalties etc. They played a fine game, but this was Celtic&#39;s season, but at least Aberdeen proved it was not easy, and their competition proved Celtic&#39;s achievement was hard fought.<br><br>On the field, the players were a little more out of sorts than usual, and Aberdeen dominated the first half, but the second half was mostly Celtic although chances could not get converted frustratingly. Aberdeen goalkeeper was excellent. No matter what anyone may say, it was a tense match for all to watch, and some of the doomsayers were annoyingly gloomy on Celtic&#39;s prospects.<br><br>Yet the spirit of Lisbon was here, and having gone a goal down only to fight back and equalise, Celtic scored a late late goal in injury time from Rogic to steal the win. Mirrored match v Inter Milan 1967 incredibly.<br><br>Rogic&#39;s goal was excellent, rounding the Aberdeen defenders to slot the ball in the tightest of angles, and this all despite that the Aberdeen defence did little wrong in their defensive duties in handling him. It was just a great goal. Aberdeen could have stolen an equaliser at the death in the match, but thankfully couldn&#39;t convert. So close. Such a wonderful match to watch.<br><br>The topping was the wonderful quotes from Brendan Rodgers in the post-match BBC interview: &quot;No, I was born into Celtic.&quot;<br><br>Brendan has written himself into Celtic history and is fast becoming a legendary figure, and I don&#39;t ever say that easily. <br><br>I can&#39;t wait till next season.<br><br><i>(fatboab of KDS)</i><br>In 50 years time, kids will be asking about the Treble Winners who went  through an entire season unbeaten. Their names will live forever in  Celtic folklore. That&#39;s what today meant. An incredible achievement by a  bunch of players , many of whom were written off by greater minds than  mine, but who discovered what it means to be touched by greatness.<br>Brendan Rodgers has achieved the impossible.

Pic: SNS/Craig Williamson <br>JOEL SKED<br>For only the fourth time in the club&rsquo;s history, Celtic completed the treble with a late, late win over Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park, a win which confirmed their unbeaten domestic season. The first time it has been achieved in the history of Scottish football. <br>In an engrossing 90 minutes Aberdeen took the lead in the ninth minute through Jonny Hayes before Stuart Armstrong levelled moments later. The game flowed back and forth with both goalkeepers in fine form. Aberdeen were hanging on at the end but it seemed that Celtic would have to wait at least 30 more minutes before making history.<br><br>Stuart Armstrong equalises for Celtic at Hampden park. Pic: SNS/Alan Harvey<br>Enter Tom Rogic. A wonderful solo run and goal handed Celtic the final piece of their famous season.<br>Having conceded six goals to Celtic in the opening 25 minutes of matches this season, Aberdeen knew that they couldn&rsquo;t afford to concede an early goal. They started with a positive mindset and proactive game plan. Kenny McLean was pushed up to support Jayden Stockley with Ryan Jack back into the middle of midfield with Graeme Shinnie.<br>They turned their strong opening into a goal just short of the 10th minute mark. Stockely and Hayes worked a one-two down Aberdeen&rsquo;s right-hand side to earn a corner. Niall McGinn swung the cross deep into the Celtic box where it was met by Hayes who had caught Griffiths ball-watching and met the ball on the half-volley, the pace making it nigh on impossible for Craig Gordon to keep it out.<br>The perfect start for the Dons. But the old adage goes, you are at your most vulnerable when you have just scored. Less than two minutes after Aberdeen&rsquo;s celebrations had ended Celtic&rsquo;s had started.<br>Celtic immediately went on the front foot getting possession deep in the Aberdeen half. They moved the ball around the centre, enticing Aberdeen&rsquo;s midfield to press the ball which helped create space for Armstrong. The Dons defence backed off with Shay Logan reluctant to close down the Celtic midfielder who has netted from outside the box throughout the season. Armstrong zipped a left-footed effort into the bottom corner for his 17th of the season.<br>It would have expected to be the turning point in the afternoon, Celtic finding their rythm and dominating the encounter, but Aberdeen did not let them do so. They continued to press the Celtic midfield, forcing the defenders to send the ball long, similar to what McInnes&rsquo; men did to Hibs in the semi-final.<br>Controversy soon followed. In the 26th minute Kieran Tierney had to be replaced by Tom Rogic. It was several minutes after he had been felled by a Stockley elbow. The striker was being marked by the left-back and turned swiftly, catching the 20-year-old with his arm.<br>Celtic&rsquo;s medical team tried in earnest to stop the bleeding but were unable to, Tierney leaving the pitch while pointing an accusatory finger at Stockley.<br>The incident added an extra element to the game, namely needle. And, if anything, it only effected Celtic further, missing the drive Tierney provided from deep with Callum McGregor slotting into the position.<br>By the 30 minute mark Craig Gordon was required to beat away two efforts in the matter of seconds. Aberdeen won the ball high before Niall McGinn followed by Jack had long-range efforts repelled by Scotland&rsquo;s number one.<br>He was called into action a few minutes later when Stockley met a corner but could only direct the ball straight at Gordon who scrambled the ball to safety.<br>Celtic were frustrated and flustered. With Scott Brown tamed, Celtic lacked rhythm. Patrick Roberts was quiet, Scott Sinclair was dropping deep to get possession, while Griffiths was left to feed off scraps. The key man was Armstrong who was constantly trying to drive his team forward. <br>Armstrong won the free-kick which Griffiths curled over the bar before, in the fifth minute of stoppage time, the striker pulled wide and sent a delicious cross into the corridor of uncertainty, met by Sinclair in the six-yard box but the Englishman inexplicably sent it over the bar.<br>In many occasions half-time is not welcomed as it takes the pace and intensity out of games. This was not the case at Hampden. Within the first eight minutes of the second half both teams could have scored two.<br>Celtic counter-attakced Aberdeen through the speedy Sinclair, the forward slipping the ball through to Griffiths who had done his trademark and pulled away from the Aberdeen defence. Turning on to his left-foot, Griffiths&rsquo; effort was deflected narrowly wide. Two minutes later it was Sinclair&rsquo;s turn to be fed, Rogic plyaing a cute pass behind the Dons defence to meet the wide-man&rsquo;s run. Joe Lewis was out quick to thwart the threat.<br>Betweeb those two Celtic chances Kenny McLean sent an inswinging cross agonisingly past the far post before a glorious chance for Aberdeen to retake the lead in the 53rd minute.<br>Brown had put McGregor in danger with a pass out to the left. Hayes read the situation, picking the pocket of the make-shift left-back and haring towards goal. He opted to play in McLean but the midfielder had made his run too early and ended up falling over the ball with the goal at his mercy.<br>Roberts came into the encounter in fine form and had been linked with a move to the Bundesliga, potentially setting the afternoon up to be his. Yet, for the first hour he had been on the periphery of the game. However, he is a player who produces moments. He almost did just that past the hour mark.<br>Getting the ball outside the box, Roberts twisted left and right, tying Mark Reynolds in knots. He worked the ball on to his favoured left before sending a curling effort goalwards only to be denied by a brilliant Lewis save, tipping the ball on to the post.<br>This was a tremendous Scottish Cup final. Still 1-1, but could easily have been 4-4 as the game entered the last 20 minutes.<br>Somehow the score was still level when Dedryck Boyata met a corner right in front of goal but thundered a header over. Aberdeen responded with a Shinnie effort from long-range which was pushed away by Gordon.<br>Even with Adam Rooney on in place of Stockley, the Dons were retreating towards their goal having exerted so much energy higher up the pitch. Griffiths had an effort saved by Lewis, and Lewis was again called into action when Sinclair snuck in at the back post to meet a cross from the striker but could only manage a poor connection. <br>Lewis was inspired and didn&rsquo;t look like being beaten again. But then again it is this Celtic side. Even when they&rsquo;ve struggled they&rsquo;ve found a way to win. And they did just that as the game headed into extra-time.<br>Rogic had been probing since coming on in the first half to no avail. Then, deep into stoppage time, he picked up the ball, skipped past Anthony O&rsquo;Connor then Considine&rsquo;s weak challenge before slotting past Lewis.<br>Celtic&rsquo;s treble was confirmed and history makers ensured.<br>&emsp;<br><br><br><h3>Five things we learned about Celtic 2 - 1 Aberdeen</h3> http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/five-things-we-learned-about-celtic-2-1-aberdeen-1-4459128<br>Celtic&#39;s Jozo Simunovic and Aberdeen&#39;s Jonny Hayes.

It had a bit of everything. Tactical battle? Check. Goalmouth action? Check. Controversy? Check. Needle? Check. Late drama? You better believe it, check!<br>In a week where we have been served a dud of a Euorpa League final - it has to be said it was the perfect performance for Manchester United - we&rsquo;ve had two great offerings from Scottish football with one more still to come. Okay, the quality is lacking at times, but what people need to realise is that is the same anywhere in the world. Yet, what makes Scottish great is the entertainment.<br>But there was little worry about the quality on display at Hampden Park, this was a tense, engrossing, at times end-to-end encounter between the country&rsquo;s two best sides. After 70 minutes the score stood at 70 minutes but it could easily have been 4-4.<br>Aberdeen went toe-to-toe with Celtic for so long. It was like watching two boxers in their prime going at each other. But it was no slug-fest; it was intelligent, physical and technical. Aberdeen, however, were the first to drop against the ropes and for so long they were saved by Joe Lewis, who was excellent throughout.<br>He has been one of the signings of the season in Scotland and could count himself unlucky not to be recognised with the club&rsquo;s player of the year award. He was imperious throughout, even slowing the game down with a moments of gamesmanship. <br>However, he was to be beaten. The culmination of a wonderfully tiring football match. Why does the season half to end?<br>McInnes&rsquo; tactical success<br>The conundrum facing Derek McInnes going into the match was whether to attack Celtic from the off, or sit back and try to hit on the counter. His decision to start Jayden Stockley over Adam Rooney - a target man instead of a goalscorer - hinted at the latter. In actual fact, it was anything but. <br>Aberdeen pretty much played a 4-2-4. Kenny McLean was pushed high alongside Stockley, with Niall McGinn and Jonny Hayes advanced high up the wings. This allowed the Dons to effectively press the Celtic back-line and squeeze the game. It also led to the opening goal. With Stockley ably supported by Hayes, the two interchanged passes before Hayes won a corner. McGinn swung it in, and found Hayes streaking away from Leigh Griffiths at the back post to score.<br>Celtic were thrown off their stride in the opening period. The back-line, in particular, were often guilty of surrendering possession deep in their own half. During one ten-minute spell, Aberdeen enjoyed a 48 per cent spell of possession in the Celtic third of the pitch.<br>READ MORE - Celtic 2 - 1 Aberdeen: How the Celtic players rated<br>... But there was a flaw<br>In order to avoid being too gung ho, Aberdeen would drop everyone back on Celtic attacks. Most teams would go zonal in an attempt to mark Celtic&rsquo;s startling array of talent. Instead, Aberdeen went man-to-man. For the most part, it worked perfectly. But the trouble with playing man-to-man, especially against the better sides, is that when someone makes a mistake and allows an opponent to get free, the whole thing is in danger of falling apart.<br>Celtic exploited the defensive structure at the equaliser. Shay Logan, having tracked Sinclair from the left wing to the centre, seemed caught in two minds as he dropped alongside Ash Taylor at centre-back. It left a pocket of space in front of the defence, and when Ryan Jack&rsquo;s attempt to cut out the pass failed, Stuart Armstrong was given time to find the far corner.<br>The turning point<br>Aberdeen&rsquo;s failure to score from the two-on-one attack, where Hayes&rsquo; pass went behind McLean, was clearly the game&rsquo;s turning point. Again, it came from Aberdeen forcing the issue high up the park, but with the underdogs tiring, it would be the last time they&rsquo;d do so effectively.<br>The substitution which saw Adam Rooney replace Stockley didn&rsquo;t help. Rooney contributed virtually nothing to the attack. Without Stockey&rsquo;s ability to hold up play, the ball just kept on coming back.<br>In fairness to Brendan Rodgers, he made a subtle change to help his side dominate. Scott Brown would drop alongside the centre-backs to start moves. This enabled the full-backs to push up, with Mikael Lustig taking Patrick Roberts&rsquo; place on the right. This freed up the in-form playmaker to float about as he pleased, and it gave the favourites a plethora of attacking menace in the central areas.<br>The move also had the added contribution of improving Brown&rsquo;s play. Dropping deeper, the captain was able to dictate play in the manner he failed during the opening half.<br>Tom Rogic: the X-factor<br>Who knows what would have happened if Kieran Tierney didn&rsquo;t get a forearm in the face from Stockley, forcing him from the action. Celtic may have won regardless. However, there can be no doubt that the man who replaced him made a massive impact, even before his goal.<br>When Roberts began moving inside, Rogic found greater space in which to attack, and the two dominated a 20-minute period following Aberdeen&rsquo;s big miss. In response, McInnes brought on Anthony O&rsquo;Connor for McGinn. His reasoning was thus: he needed a bigger body to cover Rogic. But instead of Rogic man-handling his marker, he just sprinted past O&rsquo;Connor and fired in a low front post finish with his weaker right foot, winning the cup and completing the treble.<br><br><br><br><br><h3>Celtic 2 - 1 Aberdeen: How the Celtic players rated</h3> http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/scottish-cup/celtic-2-1-aberdeen-how-the-celtic-players-rated-1-4459043<br>Scott Brown lifts the William Hill Scottish Cup as his side seal the treble.

Griffiths&rsquo; delivery was only headed as clear as far as Callum  McGregor who sent a measured volley wide.<br>Moments, later, however, the Dons broke the deadlock when Niall  McGinn&rsquo;s corner was met by Hayes on the volley, which found the net  despite the best attempts of Kieran Tierney.<br>The champions only took two minutes to respond to this early setback.  McGregor showed terrific tenacity to work the ball to Armstrong and he  took before lashing into the far corner from 20 yards for his 17th goal  of the season.<br>As the match swung from end-to-end, Graeme Shinnie flashed a shot  into the side-netting, before the match was held up for five minutes  after a controversial incident on the touchline.<br>Tierney took a forearm to the face from Jayden Stockley, which went  unpunished by referee Bobby Madden, and the talented teenager had to  leave the fray after receiving treatment. He was replaced by Rogic, with  McGregor taking up the left-back position.<br>As the Bhoys adjusted to this premature tactical switch, Craig Gordon  was called into action twice in quick succession to deny McGinn and  Shinnie from distance.<br>Celtic&rsquo;s No.1 then had to save a header from Stockley following  McGinn&rsquo;s corner, before Kenny McLean shot wide as the Pittodrie side  enjoyed a spell of pressure.<br>Eventually, the Hoops started to rediscover their rhythm and they  mustered a response when Armstrong sent a first-time shot wide after  Griffiths&rsquo; corner had been headed clear. Shinnie&rsquo;s foul on Armstrong  then presented Griffiths with a chance to try his luck from 25 yards and  the striker wasn&rsquo;t far away with his dipping drive.<br>On the stroke of half-time, Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; side almost went ahead.  Griffiths&rsquo; inviting delivery was met first-time by the onrushing  Sinclair in the six-yard box but he couldn&rsquo;t keep the ball down, leaving  the game evenly poised at the interval.<br>And it was Celtic who came closest as the second-half got underway.  Sinclair showed nimble footwork and then sent Griffiths scampering clear  and the hit-man&rsquo;s deflected shot curled inches wide of the far post.<br>At the other end, Aberdeen spurned a golden chance when Hayes robbed  McGregor of possession but he was unable to pick out the unmarked McLean  in the middle.<br>Back came the Bhoys &ndash; Sinclair&rsquo;s angled effort was blocked by Joe  Lewis, Griffiths&rsquo; had a free-kick deflected wide and Roberts was off  target after weaving his way through the Aberdeen defence. <br>The champions were growing in ascendency and the impressive Armstrong  had a shot parried by Lewis after cutting in from the left.<br>Roberts was becoming more prominent in proceedings and, after he had  jinked away from several challenges, he struck the outside of the post  with an exquisite shot. Lewis then flapped at Griffiths&rsquo; corner but  Lustig was unable to apply the finish.<br>In the 67th minute, the Celtic supporters staged their traditional  tribute to the Lisbon Lions and it almost had an inspired effect as  Griffiths fired over after a fluent passing move. <br>Another jinking run from Roberts forced Ash Taylor to head over his  own bar, and from the resultant corner,Boyata headed over when  unmarked.<br>Aberdeen briefly broke the onslaught with a long-range strike from  Shinnie which Gordon pushed wide. The one-way traffic swiftly resumed,  however, and Lewis made a brilliant stop to thwart Griffiths after he  had been teed-up by Armstrong.<br>The increasingly busy Dons shot-stopper saved his side yet again after Sinclair had been picked out by Griffiths&rsquo; delicate pass.<br>As the clock ticked down, the Pittodrie side were being forced into  some desperate last-ditch defending to keep the Bhoys at bay as Roberts  and Rogic had shots charged down.<br>Griffiths, McGregor and Sinclair all had further efforts &ndash; but then  two minutes into the three minutes of added time, Celtic finally broke  Aberdeen&rsquo;s brave resistance thanks to some individual magic from Rogic.<br>The Australian internationalist danced his way into the box and then  squeezed a shot in under Lewis, sparking utter bedlam in the Celtic End  at Hampden and frenzied celebrations on the pitch.<br>CELTIC (4-1-2-3) Gordon; Lustig, Simunovic, Boyata, Tierney (Rogic  26); Brown; McGregor, Armstrong; Roberts, (Sviatcheno 90 +3), Griffiths,  Sinclair<br> Not Used: De Vries, Bitton, Dembele, Gamboa, Forrest<br>ABERDEEN (4-3-3) Lewis; Logan, Taylor, Reynolds, Considine; Shinnie,  Jack, McLean; McGinn (O&rsquo;Connor 75), Stockley (Rooney 62), Hayes<br> Not Used: Alexander, Pawlett, Wright, Ross, Storey</div>
