Absolutely glorious performance in  every regard. I&#39;d be trying everything to ensure Jozo stays, him and  Boyata are a great pairing. The two full backs were excellent. The  midfield 3 were brilliant and the front there also. Should also be  pushing the boat out to sign Roberts.<br><br>I love beating that shower  of basterts. All they have that unites them, is their hatred of all  things Celtic, Irish and Catholic. A shower of despicable basterts to a  man and we should savour every destruction of them. Effin Yaassssss. 						 						 						 					<br><br><i>(JTH of KDS)</i><br>How in fecks name do you pick three nominations for the man of the match  thread ? Craig is probably the only one you can discount and that&#39;s a  wee bit unfair cause what little he had to do he did well.<br>That was  easily the best performance of any Celtic team at the Death Star. When  you think of the greats that have pulled on the hoops, this eleven are  worth a very honourable mention. Could easily have been 1-10 . FOUR  chances within the first 5 minutes of the second half, Sinky missing two  sitters , Calum shooting in the first two minutes instead of passing  Leigh in on an open Goal . Two very good OG attempts by Gers centre  backs.<br>Just to cheer up any lurkers , if VVD is sold this summer ,  Brendan could have &pound;15 mil burning a hole in his pocket, a new indoor  full size training area and a brand new &pound;2.5 mil hybrid pitch at  paradise. (Just look at what we did today on that beautiful Kentucky  blue grass) 						 						 						 					<br><br><i>(Silent Witness1 of KDS)</i><br><div>My  abiding memory will be not that they left early, but actually that they  stayed as long as they did looking transfixed, as paralysed by  disbelief. It was bizarre seeing their massed ranks reduced to staring  in complete silence. Even in our darkest days, when we were getting  thrashed by them, there would be some reaction from our side, mostly  likely a defiant chorus of Hail Hail. But they were simply morose in a  half-alive state. <br><br>I think the message was truly hammered home  this time. We may have beaten them four times already, but they always  had something to cling onto. Barton being an imposter. Warburton losing  it, even them equalling us for 90 mins only for us to steal it. They  came into this game sensing some kind of defiant consolation, with a few  early Loyalist chants. Their guys would be up for it and a few early  hacks would have us running in fear, just like the old days. But didn&#39;t  just beat them, we absolutely swaggered all over them, owning the pitch.  All we didn&#39;t do was play keepy-uppy Jim Baxter style at Wembley (glad  we didn&#39;t). <br><br>There were a couple of pass and move phases in the  second half where we must have strung 15+ passes together, easing from  own half to their penalty area. There is nothing more humiliating than  being taught a footballing lesson like that. They couldn&#39;t even put the  boot in, they were so defeated. <br><br>5-1 is perfectly fine for me.  We&#39;ve never destroyed them on their own park like this. In fact, we&#39;ve  never destroyed them like this in my memory. Even our earlier thrashings  had some degree of competitiveness about them.

Joe Dodoo compete in a one-sided Old Firm encounter at Ibrox. Pic: Craig Watson/PA Wire. <br>JOEL SKED<br>Celtic took another big step towards an unbeaten domestic season with an utterly dominant display at Ibrox, waltzing to their second 5-1 win of the season against their rivals.<br>Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; teams simply outclassed Rangers in every department during their biggest win at Ibrox against Rangers since 1897. They were faster and fitter, stronger and sharper. They passed the ball better, they had more skill, they showed more urgency, effort and football ability.<br>Celtic led 2-0 at half-time through a Scott Sinclair penalty and Leigh Griffiths rip-snorter, but it could have been much more.<br>Callum Mcgregor added a third with a little under ten minutes of the second half played before Dedryck Boyata headed home the fourth.<br>Kenny Miller appeared to net a consolation but Mikael Lustig confirmed the thumping with a fine solo goal.<br>The first half started at a ferocious pace. A pace which rarely relented throughout the opening period.<br>Rangers began the afternoon with a mobile and powerful midfield and attack, yet they should have fell behind with barely two minutes on the clock.<br>Fresh from his goal the previous week at Hampden Park, McGregor found himself free on the left hand side of the area and opted to go for successive goals in the Old Firm derby. With Leigh Griffiths better placed for a square pass McGregor&rsquo;s shot was blocked fantastically by Clint Hill.<br>There were half-hearted appeals for a handball but the ball rebounded off Hill&rsquo;s leg onto his hand. Griffiths showered McGregor with what was no doubt a number of expletives.<br>Celtic only had to wait three minutes for the opportunity to take the lead.<br>Myles Beerman chased Patrick Roberts and the ball as it headed out of the Rangers box towards the corner flag. The Maltese youngster foolishly lunged in to try and win the ball, swiping Roberts just inside the area as he was heading away from goal.<br>Like Sunday, Sinclair thumped the penalty past Wes Foderingham.<br>Rangers were all over the place mentally, tactically and structurally. Pedro Caixinha willed his players into challenges and to close down their opponents but they couldn&rsquo;t get near the league champions and deservedly fell further behind.<br>Stuart Armstrong bullied Emerson Hyndman in the midfield battle before feeding Griffiths in the left channel with James Tavernier appearing to have no inclination of danger. The striker had only one thing in his mind: shoot. He did so and hit a thunderbolt past Foderingham.<br>Question marks were raised about the goalkeeping considering the shot was relatively central and did get a palm to the ball, but the ball was travelling at pace.<br>Rangers&rsquo; afternoon until that point was summed up in the 24th minute when Tavernier sent a corner out for a throw-in.<br>The match had been simmering and reached boiling point when Jozo Simunovic won a hard but fair challenge which sent Kenny Miller flying in the air. It allowed Celtic to spring forward with Sinclair who fed McGregor. Spinning on the edge of the box he set up Griffiths to curl a shot off the bar with Sinclair unable to get the rebound on target.<br>Sinclair will look back on his afternoon at Ibrox as the time he should have had a first half hat-trick. Just shy of the 30 minute mark a wonderful Griffiths cross found the Englishman free at the back post but he somehow managed to miss the target completely.<br>The pace finally relented, but Celtic were in cruise control, enjoying 63 per cent of possession with Rangers failing to find the target at all. The closest the home side went was when Miller flashed a speculative effort just past the post in stoppage time.<br>A pattern of Caixinha&rsquo;s management so far has been half-time changes and he again looked towards his bench brining Andy Halliday on for the ineffectual Joe Dodoo. It had little baring.<br>Celtic went close twice before extending their lead. McGregor did get his second Old Firm goal within a week.<br>Once again Celtic swarmed forward like a green and white bees but the attack seemed to have stopped when McGregor&rsquo;s pass was intercepted.<br>Yet, the ball found its way into the Celtic midfielder&rsquo;s pass. Facing up Tavernier, McGregor shimmied and shaped before sliding the ball through the right-back&rsquo;s legs and past the despairing dive of Foderingham.<br>Rangers had little hope, little to cling to other than what remained of their pride. But the experience was about to get a little more chastening.<br>In the 66th minute Griffiths sent in a tantalising cross from a free-kick out on the right. It travelled into the perfect area between defence and goalkeeper. Boyata took advantage of the uncertainty and powered a header into the net in front of the jubilant away support.<br>Rangers were finally presented with their first meaningful chance. In the 73rd minute. An excellent turn by Josh Windass past Scott Brown presented him with a shooting opportunity. His shot was blocked but spun towards Martyn Waghorn who could only steer his header past Craig Gordon&rsquo;s post.<br>Miller, who else, did appear to salvage some pride for the home side when he combined with Windass before sliding under Gordon.<br>But their misery would be compounded when Lustig waltzed through the Rangers midfield, around Danny Wilson and curled a fine effort into the bottom corner.<br><br>  <br><h3>  These Glory, Glory Days: A Rangers-Celtic Match Report</h3>by John Reid@TJDSBlog Apr 29, 2017, 8:01am PDT<br><br>http://www.jerseydoesntshrink.com/2017/4/29/15483798/these-glory-glory-days-a-rangers-celtic-match-report-celtic<br>The players celebrate at the final whistle in front of the Celtic fans Photo by Mark Runnacles/Getty Images<br><br>Saturday April 29th: Scottish Premiership; Rangers 1 (Miller 81&#39;) Celtic 5 (Sinclair (Pen) 7&#39;, Griffiths 18&#39;, McGregor 53&#39;, Boyata 66&#39;, Lustig 87&#39;)<br><br>Celtic recorded our biggest victory over third placed Rangers at Ibrox with an emphatic 5-1 victory, our second score of the season against that crap team.<br><br>As expected, Celtic made one change with Leigh Giffiths replacing the injured Moussa Dembele. Celtic started the game on the front foot, and were award a penalty when Beerman lunged in on Patrick Roberts in the Celtic box.<br><br>Scott Sinclair stepped up and put Celtic into the lead after only 7 minutes, for his fourth goal of the season against Rangers. A Rangers fan was caught on camera giving Sinclair racist abuse so hopefully he is dealt with by the powers that be at Ibrox. A Rangers fan also tried to attack Scott Brown an threw a battery at Leigh Griffiths on a day of shame for the Ibrox club.<br><br>Celtic continued to dominate and made it 2-0 after 18 minutes, as Griffiths took a pass from Armstrong and hammered the ball into the top corner from just inside the box.<br><br>Celtic really should have scored more goals in the first half, as Griffiths curled an effort against the bar, and Sinclair put the rebound wide, then Sinclair missed a great chance from inside the box, putting an effort wide when it seemed easier to score. Also of note: a fierce Simunovic tackle on Kenny Miller which lead to Griffith&#39;s effort against the bar. A tackle which defined Celtic&#39;s performance today.<br><br>Thankfully we atoned for those misses early in the second half, when Callum McGregor scored his second goal against Rangers in six days. He tried to play a pass, the ball eventually broke to Roberts and his pass set up McGregor who passed a shot through Tavernier&#39;s legs and into the back of the net. 3-0 after 53 minutes.<br><br>Celtic continued to attack, and the fourth goal arrived in the 66th minute, as Boyata headed home a Griffiths free kick. 4-0 to Celtic, the first time we&#39;ve scored four goals at Ibrox since 1983.<br><br>Celtic slightly slackened off after this, and allowed Rangers to pull a goal back, as ex Celt Kenny Miller scored with a goal which was celebrated by the one hundred Rangers fans left in the stadium.<br><br>Thankfully Celtic were determined to put a more realistic look on the scoreline, and a fine solo goal by Mikael Lustig made it 5-1 in the 87th minute. The goal was followed by some over the top celebrations by the player.<br><br>The final whistle - after no injury time, oddly enough - brought scenes of great celebration, as Celtic&#39;s players and fans revelled in our biggest ever victory at Ibrox.<br><br>Credit has to be given to Brendan Rodgers and the players who made it 42 domestic games unbeaten. They wanted to prove a point today, and they did. Next stop - ending the league unbeaten and winning the treble. Can we do it? Well, you wouldn&#39;t put anything past this Celtic team.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>BBC</h3>Leigh Griffiths marked his return to the Celtic starting line-up with a fantastic goal<br><br>Celtic claimed their biggest ever win over Rangers at Ibrox in the final Old Firm derby of the season.<br><br>Scott Sinclair netted an early penalty after Myles Beerman needlessly fouled Patrick Roberts, and Leigh Griffiths struck a spectacular second.<br><br>Callum McGregor rolled home to extend the advantage after the interval.<br><br>Dedryck Boyata headed in Griffiths&#39; swirling free-kick before Kenny Miller replied for Rangers and Mikael Lustig curled in the visitors&#39; fifth.<br><br>Brendan Rodgers&#39; side remain unbeaten domestically this season, having also beaten Rangers in last weekend&#39;s Scottish Cup semi-final to set up a final date with Aberdeen and the chance to clinch Celtic&#39;s first domestic treble since 2001.<br>Callum McGregor<br>McGregor&#39;s goal came early in the second half<br><br>Rangers - third in the league after a second 5-1 loss to Celtic this season - remain nine points behind Aberdeen, who face St Johnstone later.<br><br>Whatever Rangers&#39; plan was, it dissipated in double quick time. It took Celtic just a single minute to cut through the home defence, McGregor being put in on goal.<br><br>Had McGregor looked outside him and rolled a pass to Griffiths then the striker would have had a tap in. Instead, he took it on himself and was denied by a brilliant last-ditch block by Clint Hill.<br><br>It was a mighty let-off for Rangers, but it was just a reprieve on what was a thunderously sobering day for them.<br><br>The opening goal came after Beerman made a bad decision when diving in on Roberts while the winger was making his way out of the penalty box.<br><br>It was an error that was punished by Sinclair, the winger sending Foderingham the wrong way from the penalty spot.<br>Scott Sinclair scores a penalty<br>Sinclair scored his fourth goal in six games against Rangers this term<br><br>Celtic did not let up. Their movement had Rangers bewildered and their work-rate ensured that whenever Rangers got the ball they were relieved of it very quickly.<br><br>The second came when Emerson Hyndman was robbed of possession by Stuart Armstrong, who played it out to Griffiths. The striker&#39;s shot from the left side of the penalty area was a venomous hit that flew over Foderingham&#39;s head.<br><br>Celtic were enjoying a mountain of possession and all the chances and should have racked up more goals before the break.<br><br>Griffiths&#39; curling shot came slapping back off the crossbar. When the loose ball fell to Sinclair he knocked it wide when he really ought to have put it away.<br><br>Sinclair had a second great chance soon after. Again, Griffiths was the creator, spinning in a ball from the left to an unmarked Sinclair at the back post. Sinclair contrived to put it wide.<br><br>Rangers&#39; defending was appalling and the half-time introduction of Andy Halliday for Joe Dodoo did nothing to change that.<br>Rangers and Celtic players<br>Rangers were humbled in their fifth defeat by Celtic this season<br><br>Celtic were on a different plain. Roberts went close to adding a third a minute into the new half, but McGregor did precisely that six minutes later. Rangers, completely spooked by Celtic&#39;s runners, stood off McGregor and he fired through James Tavernier&#39;s legs for number three.<br><br>The fourth duly arrived from Griffiths&#39; fierce free-kick on the right-hand side. Rangers had enough men in the box but Boyata was free in the six-yard area and easily nodded past Foderingham.<br><br>Miller placed home following a one-two with substitute Joe Garner but Celtic would get the day&#39;s final goal.<br><br>The history-defining fifth came when right-back Lustig skipped away from Danny Wilson and swerved a gorgeous finish past Foderingham.<br><br>Five did not flatter Celtic. Six or seven would have been a fairer reflection of their dominance but the result was enough to register their biggest away league win against Rangers since a 4-0 victory in 1897.  <br><br><br><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Rangers 1, Celtic 5.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+1&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Rangers 1, Celtic 5.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Substitution</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Substitution, Celtic.
