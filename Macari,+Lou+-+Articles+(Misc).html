It was the club he always wanted to manage, but never really got the chance to, even when given the position. It used to be his biggest regret. Then real life kicked in and gave Macari the moment that meant football ceased to matter. <br><br>Wednesday, April 28, 1999. Macari&rsquo;s 19-year-old son, Jonathan, was found hanging from a tree in the Trentham area of Stoke-on-Trent. Jonathan had signed for Nottingham Forest in his youth, but was released by the club at his own choosing. His decision to take his own life followed less than a year later. Before he was even told the news, Macari sensed what it would be when the police contacted him. His best hope was this his son had been arrested for &ldquo;knocking someone on the jaw&rdquo;, but instead it was his worst fears that were realised. <br><br>&ldquo;From that moment to almost a month later, everything more or less went blank,&rdquo; says Macari, now. &ldquo;I went home to where my wife and two other sons had gathered. I can remember us all being sat there looking at each other for hours. There&rsquo;s nothing to say. It&rsquo;s numbing. You ask yourself what could you have done? Where could you have been? Why didn&rsquo;t you do something? The role of football changed in my life at that point. It became irrelevant.&rdquo; <br><br>When it came to his recently released autobiography, the loss of his youngest son was always going to be central to the story. The telling of it is dominated by how much Macari blames himself. &ldquo;I looked after some terrific kids at the clubs I&rsquo;ve been at and if they were unhappy I&rsquo;d always find out why. When I lost my own lad it occurred to me that I hadn&rsquo;t done the same with him,&rdquo; says Macari. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t sit down and guide him in the way I should have done. I made a big mistake both in not being there for him and not being tough enough on him.&rdquo; <br><br>  <div class="float-left related-attachements-container">  <div class="clear related-attachements-bottom"></div>  <div class="padding-top-5">When his family read the first draft of his book, where Macari attempts to answer the mystery of why it happened, they questioned his conclusions. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t like me saying my son got too much money, but I maintain he did. He got &pound;5,000 just for signing a contract at Forest and a loyalty bonus of &pound;7,500 after 12 months. Money in a young man&rsquo;s pocket is a recipe for disaster and we had that disaster. Only when you go through something like that do you understand the hell of it.&rdquo; When Macari looks at football now, it is from this painful perspective. For all the game has given him, it contributed to taking Jonathan away. </div>  <div class="padding-top-5"></div></div>Macari, above right, was taken on by Celtic at 18 under Jock Stein&rsquo;s charge and made his debut three years later in August, 1970. In January 1973, having refused a contract offer, Stein told Macari he was getting in a car and heading south. He only knew it was Liverpool once he got there. The next day he signed for Manchester United. First he had rejected Stein, then Bill Shankly. He should have got a medal for bravery. <br><br>Even when he left them, though, Celtic still felt like his club. In October 1993, he was never going to turn down the offer to go back as manager. Even though he knew he should have. He had managed Swindon, West Ham, Birmingham and was doing well enough at Stoke to have been offered a new five-year contract. <br><br>&ldquo;Every time I go back to Celtic, and the last time was the Aalborg Champions League game, I get a sense of what might have been. When you see 60,000 people there it hits you how different it was to when I was there. We had barely 15,000 at games. I knew there was very little opportunity to do anything, but you go because you won&rsquo;t get another chance. It&rsquo;s the one job that I took for the wrong reasons.&rdquo; <br><br>And that was before he even met Fergus McCann. Macari&rsquo;s contention is that McCann wanted him out as soon as his consortium formally assumed control. It culminated with his sacking in mid-June 1994, apparently for going to the World Cup without permission. Macari recalls taking his seat at a match next to Walter Smith, then in his first stint as Rangers manager, and informing him of the news. Smith&rsquo;s initial reaction was to ask if it was a joke. Macari would still describe it as one. He later went to court in Edinburgh for &pound;400,000 compensation and lost more than half that amount. The football argument was with Macari, but he lost the legal one. Even now, however, he is still trying to make his case. <br><br>&ldquo;He hurt me,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Celtic was the biggest job of all for me, but it never got off the ground. It was a job I was never even given an opportunity to get near succeeding at. The conversations I had with Fergus McCann drove me crazy. The lack of support was quite incredible. It was grief all the way. I know Fergus tries to paint a completely different picture, but I worked my socks off at Celtic. I&rsquo;m sure after I left he did grasp that the way he treated me was outrageous. If I could see him again, I&rsquo;d leave him in no doubt that I was disgusted by him. I&rsquo;d have called him a liar to his face. I wasn&rsquo;t his man because the old board picked me and he wasn&rsquo;t having that. He&rsquo;d got rid of the old board&rsquo;s lawyers and accountants. I was the last man standing. I wasn&rsquo;t going to stand there screaming in public about how terrible he had been, I thought then it would be a waste of time, but looking back now I should have done it.&rdquo; <br><br>As for Tuesday&rsquo;s encounter, he has split loyalties. Celtic and United were his only two clubs as a player, and his simple wish is that both can progress. Only he already doubts that will happen. &ldquo;The two games could be a lot tighter than people think. Anyone is kidding themselves on, though, if they think the standard of player has improved at Celtic. Aiden McGeady would just have been a squad player 20 or 30 years ago.&rdquo; <br><br>Occasionally, people tell him that returning to the game would be what his son would have wanted, but Macari doubts that. These same people assured him that time would heal everything and they were wrong about that. As much as the subject of McCann and his aborted time in charge of Celtic can still rile him, there is a limit to the recriminations. Something inside Macari went missing nine years ago and he never expects to find it again. </div></div>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Lou Macari talks about the tragedy that changed his world</h3>  <div class="viewarticlepanel">  <div></div>  <div class="multiimageoff">  <div><img alt="Macari, Lou - Kerrydale Street" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Macari, Lou - Kerrydale Street"></div>  <div></div>  <div>  <div class="thumb"><img alt="Click on thumbnail to view image" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Click on thumbnail to view image"></div>  <div class="thumb"><img alt="Click on thumbnail to view image" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Click on thumbnail to view image"></div>  <div class="thumb"><img alt="Click on thumbnail to view image" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Click on thumbnail to view image"></div>  <div class="thumb"><img alt="Click on thumbnail to view image" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Click on thumbnail to view image"></div></div></div>  <div></div></div>  <div><b>Published Date: </b>10 August 2008 </div>  <div class="ds-bylinetext">By Catherine Deveney, Feature Writer of the Year</div>  <div class="ds-keypoints"></div>  <div class="ds-firstpara"><br>AS A player and manager, Lou Macari won the hearts of fans and a cabinet full of trophies. As a husband and father, he feels lost, heart-broken, his life void of one of his most beloved treasures.</div>  <div class="va-bodytext">Grief is like a furnace: trapped inside it, you become molten, malleable, ready to be fashioned into something different. And sometimes, when everything cools down again, you&#39;re stuck in an unfamiliar, awkward new shape, the person you once were fossilised inside. You can see that meeting Lou Macari. The small man who comes bustling towards me in a Manchester hotel shows, on the surface, some of the expected attributes of old: energy, bluntness, common sense. But how quickly you realise what a shell the human body is, just a carapace built of the outer edge of experiences that are carried mainly on the inside. And when you pick that old, crusty shell, no matter how many years it has been forming, fresh blood flows.<br><br>Macari has been through a lot in his life. The man who played for Celtic under Jock Stein, for Manchester United under Tommy Docherty, for Ally MacLeod&#39;s dream team of the 1978 World Cup, is no stranger to turmoil. Not just losing to Peru, or weathering the heights of ridicule that Ally&#39;s Army were exposed to back then, because see that? That was only a game. Macari came to know the difference between life and a game.<br><br>Not even being banged up in a police cell, falsely accused of fraud when he was manager of Swindon, registers much. Nor losing all the money he had made as a footballer (loose change to the pampered, David Beckham generation of footballers) when he took Fergus McCann to court after McCann peremptorily sacked him as manager of Celtic. And why is he not bitter about that? Because that&#39;s only money. He smiles. Fergus McCann? He wouldn&#39;t waste energy thinking about him. &quot;I can laugh now. I can say, &#39;How big a deal was that? Not very.&#39;&quot;<br><br>Strange how familiar Macari seems, how instantly comfortable to be with, despite the conversation being about such troubling things. Because I know his type; we all know his type. That generation of Scottish men who may be a bit buttoned up but so thoroughly decent you&#39;d trust them with your life, and if you ever earn their love or their loyalty then, my God, you&#39;re tapping into a deep well. The only drawback being they&#39;re more likely to drown in there than tell you.<br><br>Macari does not waste words. He has just produced an autobiography, Football, My Life, and right at the start of it he says the events of his life have put football into perspective. Then he barely mentions his private life again until near the end, when in one short section he presents the reader with everything he&#39;s going to tell, like he simply boxed it all up and unwrapped it only when forced. It recounts the defining event of his life: the 1999 suicide of his youngest son, Jonathan, when he was just 19.<br><br>Was that the only way he could deal with it, to contain it in that way? Macari hesitates. The football side, the facts and the figures, take care of themselves. &quot;You just say what happened. You know you may say one or two things that might upset people, but what&#39;s more important is that when you&#39;re talking about family, especially someone you&#39;ve lost&hellip; it&#39;s difficult, sensitive&hellip; the hardest part of the book.&quot; It caused a few problems at home, he admits. Maybe that&#39;s the way it should be, because when you love someone, everything matters &ndash; every word, every thought, every nuance. And talking to Macari, you&#39;re in no doubt how loved Jonathan was. How important he was. How different life is now.<br><br>When you look at a stopped watch, often the last thing you notice is that it has stopped. It can con you for a while. You see the face, the strap, the hands pointing to a time. It looks normal until suddenly you see that the small seconds hand is motionless. There is about Macari, that sense of apparent normality concealing malfunction. &quot;I&#39;ve got to put on a false face,&quot; he says. If it hadn&#39;t happened, he&#39;d be sitting here reflecting on the greatest parts of his life. &quot;Oh, that day at Hampden Park when we beat Rangers and I was a young player and got my first Scottish Cup medal &ndash; that was great. And that was followed by a trip to Wembley&hellip; and how lucky I&#39;ve been, I&#39;ve played for Scotland. But I don&#39;t sit down and look back and think what&#39;s been great, because one event has washed it all away.&quot; It&#39;s the same for any parent who loses a child, he says. Parents whose children are killed in Afghanistan or Iraq. You can&#39;t ever tell how you&#39;ll deal with it. &quot;Certainly, it could stop the rest of your life. You could just come to a complete standstill.&quot;<br><br>THE ITALIANS WHO emigrated to Scotland often have wonderful stories of how they got here &ndash; literally walking from the Italian mountains, across Europe, searching for a new life. Macari has no such story. He talks only reluctantly of his Italian lineage. When Lou was just a year old, his parents moved away from Scotland to London, where they would remain for the next eight years. Lou&#39;s father was a grafter, working in the catering industry, while back home his own parents ran a successful caf&eacute; in Largs. There was Nardini&#39;s at one end, the Moorings at the other, and Macari&#39;s in the middle.<br><br>Whatever the reason for Macari&#39;s indifference to his Italian roots (I suspect his grandparents would have preferred their son to marry an Italian than a Scot), what&#39;s more important is the attitude he displays: a fierce loyalty to his parents, a strong sense of what he believes is right and wrong. He was an only child and his parents died in their 40s. &quot;What they did for me, and how they looked after me&hellip; how they got me to Celtic Park when I was starting off as a reserve player&hellip; you just don&#39;t get the chance to repay them.&quot;<br><br>His parents had moved back to Largs from London, and Macari&#39;s house backed on to the Largs recreation centre where he watched footballers in pre-season training. There he was, 12 years old, wearing his Celtic scarf in the garden and watching Billy McNeill, thinking this was the closest he would ever get to his Lisbon Lions heroes. But at 16 he was signed by Celtic and worked under the legendary Jock Stein, a man who inspired both respect and fear. Stein had them running from Celtic Park to Barrowfield every day and he would drive alongside his players, shouting, &quot;Get a move on!&quot; from the open window.<br><br>&quot;I was terrified of him,&quot; recalls Macari. &quot;Everyone was terrified of him. You didn&#39;t get a second chance with Jock. It&#39;s strange to think about it now, but even Coca-Cola was frowned on. If you sneaked a Coke up to your room at night and he spotted it, he&#39;d throw it down the sink and say, in typical Jock fashion, &#39;I&#39;ll Coca-Cola you.&#39;&quot;<br><br>That kind of discipline is lacking nowadays. Macari cleaned the Lisbon Lions&#39; boots and dealt with their laundry and felt privileged to do so. There were no guarantees about making it as a player, no fancy wage packets. Now, money has taken the hunger from young players, taken away their sharpness and drive. Macari insists that even footballers regarded as naturally gifted, such as Kenny Dalglish, needed to be pushed. &quot;Was I talented and gifted enough to achieve it on my own?&quot; asks Macari. &quot;No, I wasn&#39;t. The man who pushed me along the way, who made me run and made me appreciate everything you get out of the game, was Jock Stein. I was guided in the right direction, given a chance of being a footballer, and that&#39;s all it was &ndash; a chance.&quot;<br><br>The Scots in general have a tremendous record in football management. &quot;They have a hunger,&quot; explains Macari. Alex Ferguson has a huge start on every other manager because of his disciplined style. &quot;They&#39;re all pussyfooting around and players are stepping out of line. Alex is trying his best to keep hold of his beliefs in a changing world, and he probably knows he&#39;s not going to achieve that, but I would say he still has a greater hold on his players than any manager in the country. And long may that continue. He worked with Jock and no doubt things rubbed off on him because I see similarities between the two managers. Stein helped me have a long career, and Dalglish and Danny McGrain&hellip; all because of the start that was demanded of us, the levels of commitment, of fitness.&quot;<br><br>It makes him laugh when people talk so earnestly now about football tactics and formations and fancy this and fancy that. He&#39;s of the run-your-guts-out-on-the-field school, with fish and chips on the team bus on the way home. It&#39;s not foreign players who are keeping the home players out of sides. (He remembers Brazilians being brought by Stein to Celtic and Scandinavians being brought to Morton.) But the home players had the edge because they were driven. He has seen players who didn&#39;t really have the natural ability to make it, achieve because they were focused. &quot;So focused they&#39;d stay in at weekends and they&#39;d be the type cleaning their boots in their digs and looking forward to training on Monday morning. Is that happening nowadays? No chance. No chance whatsoever. It&#39;s looking forward to the weekend now. I&#39;m a great believer that it&#39;s just enough to throw your career off the route it should be going.&quot;<br><br>He never imagined he would leave Celtic, but he knew he could make three or four times as much in England. &quot;If I had still been the young lad picking up my wages on a Tuesday, still heading into town with Dalglish, McGrain and David Hay, and spending three or four quid on a meal, happy as Larry with no commitments, then fine.&quot; But life had changed. He was married, his wife was expecting, and, tragically, his father had died of cancer and he now needed to support his mother. He headed south to sign for Liverpool and ended up being snatched at the last minute by Manchester United, who at that time were far less successful than their Merseyside rivals. He&#39;d have ended his career with more medals at Liverpool but he doesn&#39;t regret joining United. He got career decisions right. It&#39;s other things in life he got wrong.<br><br>In the years following his father&#39;s death, his mother stayed in Largs. Macari intended to bring her down to Manchester, and even invested in a chip shop for her to run. But life was busy and the 1978 World Cup was approaching, and she died before he got round to organising her move. He still feels so guilty about that. &quot;You kick yourself for not doing this, not doing that,&quot; he says. <br><br>He had tried phoning her just three or four days before but had got no answer. Now he was sitting in a hotel with the Scotland team when he looked up and saw his cousin, a doctor, walking through the door. &quot;I thought, &#39;I haven&#39;t seen him for a while,&#39; and by the time he got from the front door to me, I thought, &#39;Bloody hell, there&#39;s something&hellip;&#39; His face, the way he greeted me &ndash; there was obviously bad news. He&#39;d come to inform me that my mum had been found dead in the house. She had been lying there maybe four or five days and I couldn&#39;t go and identify her. That&#39;s why he had been called in.&quot;<br><br>The circumstances of her death were strange, and Macari still has no answers. Does he know why she died? &quot;No,&quot; he says. &quot;My mum had been on her own, and in the conversation I&#39;d had with her she said she had some friends up there. Putting the pieces together after she died, I just wasn&#39;t convinced that the friends were good friends. Some money had gone missing.&quot; She had signed things over to these friends that she shouldn&#39;t have. She was on tablets, had taken too many and simply never woke up.<br><br>Macari thinks now that she never got over her husband&#39;s death. &quot;She never really showed me she couldn&#39;t get over the loss of him because it&#39;s something a parent would probably want to hide from their child, but I always had a gut feeling that losing my dad would be tough on her, really tough.&quot; They were a close couple? &quot;I would have said as close as you get. And I&#39;ve moved down south and am not really there to gauge how she&#39;s coping with it, and of course when I phone up and speak to her she&#39;s giving me the impression she&#39;s coping fine, which is probably what I would do&hellip; what I do at this moment in time with my lad. I&#39;ve got to be seen to be coping.&quot; And is he? He avoids the question. &quot;It&#39;s tough, isn&#39;t it?&quot; he says instead.<br><br>JONATHAN RUNS LIKE a thread through the conversation, a coloured thread against which everything else in life is compared. The talk of discipline among young footballers, of the effect of high wages on their playing, on their psyches&hellip; I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s just the musings of an older player on the current state of the game. I think maybe we&#39;re talking about Jonathan. Macari has three sons, all of whom have played the game professionally. You can tell he&#39;s proud of them all. You can also tell he&#39;s not a man for making big boasts, but he says Jonathan was really talented, had the ability to go places. He had signed for Nottingham Forest. But things weren&#39;t going right.<br><br>Did the new football culture he describes contribute to Jonathan&#39;s difficulties? &quot;I think it would surprise you, the money,&quot; he says. &quot;I argued about it even with my wife. The money he got for walking out of school and into a football club was insignificant to what a lot of them are being paid now, but it was enough to give him a cosy start to his football career and it shouldn&#39;t have been. I just felt it was too much.&quot; It was life-changing. &quot;If my lad decided to go out every Saturday night because he&#39;s got the finance, it can&#39;t be doing him any good.&quot;<br><br>When Macari stopped playing at the age of 34, he had no stash of cash for life. He went into football management, with stints at Stoke, Swindon, Birmingham City and, of course, Celtic, and looks back on the stresses and strains with a kind of indifference. The fraud charges at Swindon came about because the team captain asked him for &pound;40 bonuses for the players. Macari asked the board; they agreed. Macari wasn&#39;t to know the payments weren&#39;t accounted properly. He had no interest in accounts. The same thing was happening in other clubs and involving far bigger sums, and Macari believes Swindon was used as a warning to higher-profile clubs. But Macari himself was cleared.<br><br>As for Celtic, well, Fergus McCann arrived just after Macari was appointed, and Macari felt from the start McCann wanted him out. (In fact, a journalist phoned Macari on McCann&#39;s first day to say a senior Celtic figure had told him so.) But it would have cost McCann a lot of money to buy out Macari&#39;s contract. Their working relationship was disastrous, with McCann communicating by letter despite their offices being only 50 yards apart. &quot;I didn&#39;t bring it to a head because I wanted to be manager of Celtic. That&#39;s why I came back, why anybody would have come back. I was willing to put up with all the crap that was going on, willing to put up with him not giving me money to buy players, because I wanted to be manager of Celtic.&quot;<br><br>McCann knew employment law. Macari didn&#39;t. When the chairman eventually sacked him for disobeying an instruction, Macari took him to court. Halfway through, Macari&#39;s lawyer was promoted to Lord Advocate with immediate effect. Macari subsequently lost not just his lawyer but the case and his savings. He must have been bitter, surely, losing everything? &quot;At the time you&#39;re upset because you know the way it&#39;s been manoeuvred and what is being said is untrue. And it leaves a nasty taste in your mouth. Years later, when you see others in the hot seat &ndash; Tommy Burns, God rest him, Wim Jansen &ndash; it wasn&#39;t a personal thing against me. It was the way he was.&quot;<br><br>It doesn&#39;t rankle that he wasn&#39;t a successful Celtic manager. &quot;It was never on the cards. It was never to be. People have said Fergus saved Celtic, and I understand why they say it. But if Fergus hadn&#39;t come in, someone else would have, because the job was there to do. In fairness to Fergus, that&#39;s where he was smart &ndash; he realised what Celtic Football Club had going for it, not just at that time but what it has always got going for it: a massive worldwide support.&quot;<br><br>People generally divide into two camps: those who are embittered by bad experiences and those who shake them off. &quot;I can shake it off,&quot; says Macari. &quot;There are other things I will never shake off.&quot;<br><br>JONATHAN MACARI was small, like his dad, and happy-go-lucky. He was a striker, played up front in a little-and-large combination with Marlon Harewood, a big 6ft-tall centre forward who has gone on to play for Aston Villa. The manager had cleared out a lot of young players but kept Jonathan. He was a prospect. So it was a shock when Jonathan himself decided to leave. Macari didn&#39;t understand.<br><br>The morning he learned his son was dead, Jonathan&#39;s girlfriend had called at the house. Had Jon come back? No, Macari said, he thought he was with her. Jonathan&#39;s body was discovered hanging in a wood by a man on his way to work. Macari has never found out what really happened. Jon was closer to his mum, Dale Marie, but she doesn&#39;t know either. &quot;There&#39;s no point in guessing,&quot; says Macari. &quot;I have my own thoughts but it wouldn&#39;t be right to put them into print because Jonathan&#39;s not here to tell us.&quot;<br><br>Maybe at 19, life and love are a bit more intense than at other times in your life. There was also talk of drugs but Macari has discounted that now. &quot;At the time, I possibly believed drugs were part of it, but I don&#39;t any more. My lad wasn&#39;t an angel. He had stepped out of line, but at that particular time he didn&#39;t have a problem. The coroner made that clear. If it was drug-related I wouldn&#39;t have a problem saying so because it would be giving youngsters an indication of what can happen. But, no, it wasn&#39;t the case.&quot;<br><br>People think of grief as the great unifier, but more often it&#39;s the great divider. That&#39;s nothing to do with how much you love the people around you, it&#39;s to do with everybody expressing their grief differently. I tell Macari I have often been struck by how differently mothers and fathers deal with the loss of a child. A mother once told me she wanted to talk about her dead son all the time. Her husband&#39;s way of coping was never to mention him. That difference was hard for both of them.<br><br>Macari nods. Later, he says he probably does the opposite of what his wife does. And he has a friend who lost a son and who visits the cemetery every week. Macari couldn&#39;t do that. He sees the stone on the next grave, a woman of 89, and it pierces him to see Jonathan&#39;s age beside it. But he wouldn&#39;t criticise any way of coping with grief. &quot;We all deal with it differently, and I couldn&#39;t tell you how the other members of my family are dealing with it because I just don&#39;t know.&quot;<br><br>He has videos of Jonathan playing football. Videos from Sky television of himself being interviewed with his three lads round him. &quot;I could get all those memories back but I&#39;m just not sure I would want to sit in the house and put on a DVD and see that again. I&#39;ve not asked my wife but she might want that. I don&#39;t go down the road of even talking about it.&quot;<br><br>But he loves his family, keeps going for them. &quot;I just know that I&#39;ve got a commitment to them and therefore I&#39;ve got to continue working.&quot; He works for Sky and Manchester United TV, and he can&#39;t be on screen looking miserable. He has to paint a smile on. But he&#39;s not sure he would have the patience or the focus for management any more. Things are different.<br><br>When your child dies, you deal with grief and loss. When your child commits suicide, you deal with grief, loss and guilt. &quot;You&#39;re asking yourself why, wondering what you could have done.&quot; Macari&#39;s burden is all too obviously heavy. But if another teenager committed suicide, would he blame their parents? No, he says quietly. Yet he would blame himself for Jonathan&#39;s death? &quot;I would, yeah. You take the view, &#39;Why didn&#39;t I do this? Why didn&#39;t I do that?&#39; It&#39;s difficult to erase those thoughts from your mind. I just felt that I missed things. I wouldn&#39;t say they were staring me in the face or I wouldn&#39;t have missed them. But why would someone&hellip;&quot;<br><br>He breaks off. As a manager, he was so careful with youngsters. Tried to protect them. If a talented lad had come in saying he wanted to leave he&#39;d have kept him in his office for a day until he found out why. But he never found out with his own boy. But I&#39;ll bet he tried. &quot;I did try, yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;I didn&#39;t get any answers.&quot; Well, how could he possibly have known time was running out to get answers? But nothing will convince Macari not to blame himself. It&#39;s why he hasn&#39;t bothered with counselling.<br><br>Occasionally, interviewing can seem like a worthless kind of dance, chipping at ego, skirting round truth. Today it feels like the most privileged job in the world talking to someone about things that really matter. People say time is a great healer, says Macari. He hasn&#39;t found that. No wonder &ndash; the phrase implies at some stage you get your old life back. How can you? When you come out of the heat of the furnace that loss imposes on you, you have to take on a different shape. The challenge is to make it a good shape.<br><br>But is Macari capable of happiness again? &quot;I couldn&#39;t have the streamers out at Christmas, the whoo-hoo&hellip; I couldn&#39;t. I&#39;d be ashamed of myself, to be honest. It would be a bit of a betrayal. I&#39;m not going to ruin it for other people. I just don&#39;t get into that environment. I&#39;ll take my kids out and my grandchildren, and hopefully we&#39;ll enjoy ourselves. But events like Christmas and birthday parties&hellip; I just feel that wouldn&#39;t be right.&quot;<br><br>There is something very, very Scottish about Lou Macari, for all his years in the south. A blunt simplicity. An emotional quality, both diffident and piercing. The poet Hugh MacDiarmid famously wrote about the little white rose of Scotland that &quot;smells sharp and sweet and breaks the heart&quot;. A Scottish footballer might be the last person you&#39;d associate with flowers and sentiment. And yet for some subliminal reason, that line returns to me over and over when I leave Macari. Maybe it&#39;s because the deepest things in life are often the simplest. Sometimes, when he&#39;s on his way home from a good football match, Macari is almost tricked into thinking he&#39;s happy, and then it hits him. &quot;You&#39;re going back to a house where there&#39;s one missing.&quot;</div><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Macari, Lou - Articles (Misc) - The Celtic Wiki" height="953" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d9bce435908e413ecd1f9fe0587e88e6/GW719H953" title="Macari, Lou - Articles (Misc) - The Celtic Wiki" width="719"><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Bhoy In The Picture - Lou Macari	</h3>Written by St Anthony (from Celtic Underground) <br>source: <a class="external" href="http://www.celticunderground.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=448:the-bhoy-in-the-picture-lou-macari&catid=36:images&Itemid=60#addcomments" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc">link</font></a><br><table class="contentpaneopen"><tbody><tr></tr></tbody></table>Through  the years I&rsquo;ve never subscribed to the fascination of having a   favourite player, much preferring to appreciate the efforts and talents   of the Celtic team as a whole. I&rsquo;ve had plenty of friends and   acquaintances who have been obsessed with the likes of Johnstone,   Dalglish, Provan, McStay and Larsson.<br><br> When I was young I lived in Govan and there was an Italian family  who  stayed in our close called Franchi, who hailed from Florence. We  always  pronounced it as &lsquo;Fran-shay&rsquo; when the correct pronunciation is  actually  &lsquo;Frankie&rsquo; and the two girls, Elia and Lucia, were my best  friends at a  young age. Elia was the oldest and was a real tomboy,  absolutely  football mad. She and I would play football in the back  court and  because of her Italian heritage she would insist on being Lou  Macari in  our football games with me opting for Jimmy Johnstone or  Bobby Lennox. In the early 70&rsquo;s Lou Macari seemed like an exotic  creature in this  dull country we live in. He had a wonderfully unusual  name and the press  were always attracted to him given his Italian  extraction. In 1972 when  Celtic played Inter Milan in the European Cup  semi final the Italian  press corps were infatuated with the young  Macari because of the Italian  connection and found it hard to  comprehend that an Italian Scot was up  against them.     What also made  Lou different was he was an excellent player. A sniffer, a  poacher,  who could bag goals out of nothing and defenders hated playing  against  him because he was a niggly wee guy who was always snapping  away at the  heels of those bigger centre halves. In his early days Jock  Stein  compared Macari&rsquo;s finishing ability to that of Jimmy Greaves and  the  big man wasn&rsquo;t noted for making extravagant comparisons of that  sort.   Celtic fans loved wee Lou and had a few notable chants in his name.   &lsquo;Lou, Lou, skip to my Lou&rsquo; was probably the most common one and it   should be noted that the Ibrox choirboys of the time had their own more   obscene version. When I heard the popular &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve got Harry&hellip;and Lou   Macari&hellip;and Kevin Barry&rsquo; chant at a young age my Father explained to me   that Kevin Barry was a Celtic player in the 1950&rsquo;s so reluctant was he   to go into an explanation with his young son about something of which I   wouldn&rsquo;t understand anyway.<br><br> Lou was very much a man for the big occasion and when Celtic drew   with Rangers in the 1971 Scottish Cup final the Celts&rsquo; forwards had   missed a plethora of chances. Lou was Celtic&rsquo;s substitute that day and   for the replay he was thrown in from the start as replacement for Willie   Wallace and he showed his sharpness by scoring an opportunist opening   goal, Celtic going on to win 2-1, much easier than the actual result   suggests. In the 1972 Scottish Cup final he was part of the team who   ripped Hibs apart by 6-1, scoring twice in the process. He scored a   dramatic goal against Ujpest Dosza at Parkhead in March 1972 with the   cutest of lobs over the Hungarian goalkeeper which took Celtic to the   semis against Inter Milan. Macari was a great goal scorer and was a real   asset to Celtic at this time.<br><br> Part of the reason Celtic fans took to him was the effort that he  put  in against Rangers. Lou never hid his dislike for our Glasgow  rivals  and this went down tremendously well with a hardcore element of  the  Celtic support.<br><br> Macari was actually only a first team regular for three seasons but   such was the impression he made that he became a highly sought after   commodity with the big English teams down south. The parting of the ways   was sewn in the summer of 1972 when Lou was the only Celtic player to   travel with Scotland on their tour of Brazil. McNeill, Murdoch,   Johnstone and Dalglish were all required in the Scots&rsquo; squad but Jock   Stein managed to persuade (or intimidate) all four of them into refusing   to go for various reasons. Stein thought the trip was too far and too   long and wanted his stars fully rested over the summer months for the   new season in August. However, Lou rebuffed all Jock&rsquo;s efforts to   dissuade him from going which showed that the young Macari was very much   his own man and was a strong willed character as well.<br><br> It was on this trip that Lou learned of how much the Anglo Scots   players earned and this turned his head somewhat. The Scotland manager   was the ex Celt, Tommy Docherty, and when Manchester United required a   new manager in the early winter of 1972, the Doc was their man and Lou   was his first target. By this time Lou had married an American girl in   Saint Patrick&rsquo;s cathedral in New York and perhaps he had a more   cosmopolitan attitude at this time compared to other Celtic players.<br><br> Older Celtic fans will tell you that Macari was causing a bit of   distress behind the scenes at Celtic Park at that time with several   controversial newspaper interviews and rather than tolerate a   troublesome personality in the dressing room, Stein decided it was time   Lou moved on. Celtic at that time had an embarrassment of riches in   their forward line with Johnstone, Dalglish, Deans, Hood, Lennox and   Macari all vying for three places in the attack. Lou was, arguably, not   even a guaranteed starter in the first eleven and Stein did good   business in obtaining a massive &pound;200,000 transfer fee from Old Trafford.   He was a loss but not to extent that Davie Hay would be missed in 1974   or Kenny Dalglish in 1977, both of whom who were virtually   irreplaceable. Macari showed his single mindedness again by  sensationally snubbing  Bill Shankly&rsquo;s advances to bring him to  Liverpool in order to go to Old  Trafford. This was not the greatest  career move as Liverpool would be  come the dominant force in European  football for the next 10 years.<br><br> The strange thing is that United converted Macari from an ace goal   scorer to being a deep lying midfielder and success was hard to come  by,  United even being sensationally relegated to the second division in   1974, on the very same day that Celtic celebrated their 9 in a row   league title win at Brockville.<br><br> In 1976 Manchester United came up for the Johnstone/Lennox   testimonial and Lou stated publicly that he could not bring himself ever   to play against his beloved Celtic. However, by 1980 he had a change  of  heart and decided to play for United in another testimonial game at   Parkhead for his great friend, Danny McGrain. United actually made him   captain for the occasion and he was given a rapturous ovation from the   Celtic fans in the Jungle.<br><br> Somewhat curiously, the fans in that same area two years previously   had given Kenny Dalglish absolute dog&rsquo;s abuse when he returned in a   Liverpool jersey and it was claimed that the Pope would have received a   better reception at Ibrox. This still annoys me intensely to this day   because Dalglish gave infinitely more to the Celtic cause than Macari   ever did and was a consummate professional as well.<br><br> In 1984 Macari was given a testimonial for his eleven years service   at Old Trafford and Celtic were his chosen opponents. Lou contented   himself by playing for United in the first half and Celtic in the second   half in what was an entertaining game and his pockets were well lined   by the 15,000 Celtic fans who travelled down for the occasion.<br><br> Looking back after all these years we should appreciate Lou&rsquo;s  efforts  in the hoops and he was part of a fantastic, attacking, Celtic  team in  perhaps the most successful period of the club&rsquo;s history. It&rsquo;s  just a pity he couldn&rsquo;t have saw fit to have hung around Parkhead for a  good while longer.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic &#39;saviour&#39; falls victim to new regime          						   						</h3> JIM REYNOLDS  	    <div class="comments-top">       Herald newspaper<br><a class="external" href="http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/celtic-saviour-falls-victim-to-new-regime-1.498516#have-your-say" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Macari, Lou - Misc Articles - The Celtic Wiki" class="icon-comments" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/MlRyYBVx8x4b8AZ0w2jTNQ43" title="Macari, Lou - Misc Articles - The Celtic Wiki"></a>     </div>     		17 Jun 1994<br><div class="article-body">                                                                             Jim Reynolds reports how only eight months ago Lou Macari arrived back    at Parkhead to restore Celtic&#39;s fortunes, and yesterday the new board    showed him the red card.<br> THE rumours which have been rife around Parkhead since the dawn of the    Fergus McCann era became a sad fact for Lou Macari yesterday when the    most famous revolving door in sport -- that used most often by football    managers -- turned him out into the street after less than eight months    in the job.<br> Macari was to be the saviour of Celtic, the man to build a side    capable of ending Rangers domination of the Scottish scene, but while    the majority of fans welcomed his arrival with boundless enthusiasm    others were asking themselves why a man who publicly announced himself    to be a Celtic man through and through seemed at one point reluctant to    claim the job on offer after the sacking of Liam Brady.<br> Negotiations had been long, and until he eventually decided to return    to Parkhead on October 26 of last year, there always remained some doubt    as to whether he would leave Stoke City, where he had been immensely    popular. Maybe Macari thought that a board of directors who could so easily get    rid of men of stature such as Billy McNeill, David Hay and Brady left a    lot to be desired. How ironic now that with the influence of the old    board practically gone, Macari should fall victim to the new regime.<br> Yet it all began so well for Celtic and Macari last autumn. His first    match produced a victory over Rangers in a premier division match at    Ibrox -- then came the little signs that all was not well. Backroom    staff had been shuffled and elbowed aside, Macari brought in his own    men, Chic Bates, Ashley Grimes and Peter Henderson, and the club was    knocked out of the UEFA Cup by Sporting Lisbon. Even as a player Macari was never slow to air his views. In a way he    was something of a sports writer&#39;s dream, because you rarely got a &#39;&#39;no    comment&#39;&#39; from him. As a manager he had not changed much in that    respect, which meant he upset others.<br> As a player, it was mainly officialdom which suffered from his    comments, the most famous probably being his fierce criticism of the    SFA&#39;s arrangements during the World Cup finals in Argentina in 1978.    Most players thought the conditions at their training headquarters in    Alta Gracia were too spartan. Macari said it.<br> That ended an international career which had seen him win 24 caps and    score five goals for Scotland. Following Macari&#39;s blast, the then    secretary of the SFA, Ernie Walker, said his association &#39;&#39;would be    delighted to accede to Mr Macari&#39;s request not to be considered in the    future&#39;&#39;.<br> Macari&#39;s Celtic career began in 1966 when he joined them from St.    Michael&#39;s Academy, in Kilwinning, and he made his first-team debut as a    substitute in a league cup tie against Ayr United at Somerset Park on    September 27, 1967. In the aftermath of Celtic&#39;s European Cup victory    and with the emergence of a new breed of outstanding players such as    Danny McGrain, David Hay and Kenny Dalglish, it took an exceptional    player to break through at Parkhead.<br> Macari did just that and before joining Manchester United for #210,000    in 1973, he had played 90 domestic matches for the club, scoring 48    goals. He also won two championship badges and two Scottish Cup winners&#39;    medals. Success followed at Old Trafford (a second division championship win    and an FA Cup final success against Liverpool) before he moved to    Swindon as player-manager in 1984. He steered the Wiltshire team from    the fourth to the second division in five years and then took over at    West Ham from John Lyall.<br> His reign at Upton Park did not last long. The man, who never hid the    fact that he liked a punt, was fined #1000 by the FA for breaking a rule    regarding betting on matches while at Swindon, and resigned.<br> He returned to football as manager of Birmingham City in 1991 and    after just four months there he joined Stoke. Controversy, as well as    success, followed the little man, and in 1992 he was cleared in court of    tax fiddle allegations involving under-the-table payments to Swindon    players.<br> Last October Macari returned &#39;&#39;home&#39;&#39; to his first love, but the    rapport he enjoyed with his players in other places seemingly did not    follow him to Parkhead. Senior players openly criticised his style of    management and if a manager does not have the confidence and respect of    his players there is no chance he will achieve success. That was most    emphatically underlined by yesterday&#39;s events in Kerrydale Street.<br> Lou Macari had a proven track record as a manager but, sadly, when it    came to the job in which he most wanted to succeed he was unable to    convince his employers, or his players, that he had what it took to win    trophies in such a high-profile position.<br> There is no doubt Macari will bounce back. He will not be lost to    football, because there are several clubs who would employ him    immediately. There is also little doubt that his Parkhead experience    will not alter his views on how he should go about his managerial duties    when he does take up the next challenge.<br> THE MACARI CAREER * 1966 -- Joined Celtic from St Michael&#39;s Academy, Kilwinning. * 1967 -- First-team debut for Celtic in League Cup tie at Ayr. * 1972 -- Made Scotland debut in 1-0 win over Wales.

Picture: Rex/Shutterstock.<br>Aidan Smith<br>Published: 06:00 Saturday 02 June 2018<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/interview-ex-scotland-star-lou-macari-is-devoted-to-helping-the-homeless-1-4748719<br>It could be a football changing room, given the unholy racket of shouting and raucous laughter that&rsquo;s taking place through the wall from where Lou Macari is sat. In truth, though, we couldn&rsquo;t be further from his old life.<br><br>This is the Macari Centre which very definitely isn&rsquo;t a museum dedicated to a career spent winning titles and trophies with Celtic and Manchester United and playing in the World Cup for Scotland. Rather it&rsquo;s a shelter for the homeless, a refuge offering blankets, food and hope.<br><br>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better not be swearing because Sister&rsquo;s in today,&rdquo; he says, referring to the local nun who is currently parceling up surplus donated clothes to send to an orphanage in Kenya. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t swear like I normally do when I&rsquo;m here. I&rsquo;m not the ex-player or the ex-manager here; I&rsquo;m just doing what I can to help. The other week I was at Wembley for the FA Cup final where, as usual, the buffet in hospitality was fabulous. Here there are folk who are oh so grateful for a cup of tea and a bacon roll and to be honest I&rsquo;m just as grateful I&rsquo;m able to see how the other half lives, or tries to.&rdquo;<br><br>Macari does more than man the urn; without him the street retreat in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent wouldn&rsquo;t exist. He got the idea after no greater exposure to the homelessness issue than yours or mine: he saw people sleeping rough and in doorways, quite a lot of them, only he didn&rsquo;t simply exude sympathy and maybe a few coins then walk on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m probably here too often,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s a hectic place with new people arriving all the time.&rdquo;<br><br>Macari clearly has a big heart but, having learned under one of football&rsquo;s great disciplinarians, Jock Stein, he&rsquo;s no soft touch. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s always an issue with someone. I&rsquo;ll read the behaviour reports from the previous day and something will have gone wrong. So-and-so was due in court &ndash; why didn&rsquo;t they go? Or, if they did go, why did they dress like a homeless person when we&rsquo;ve got decent clothes they can wear? But I like the banter in this place. Some people know who I am but a few won&rsquo;t. Aye, sometimes you&rsquo;ve got to separate the hard-luck stories from the ******** but one of the ways you can help is by talking to the folk, listening to them, acknowledging they exist.&rdquo;<br><br>A morning spent in Macari&rsquo;s company can put a lot of things in perspective and the man himself, coming from the world of football where these days the top players barely have to tie their own laces or apply their own moisturiser, is well aware of this. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re younger you take everything that comes your way,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But when you get older you realise there&rsquo;s a lot less fortunate people out there.&rdquo;<br><br>And the difficulties faced by refuge regulars &ndash; alcohol and drugs problems, adrift from family, no fixed abode and as a result little chance of getting a job &ndash; can make the grumbles of Scotland&rsquo;s 1978 World Cup squad seem really pathetic.<br><br>Those of us who lived through that disastrous campaign have heard the grumbles repeated many times. The hotel beds were too hard, the soup was inedible, the pool had no water in it and the opposition were too crafty. BBC Scotland have just reheated the complaints for a documentary, something which probably wouldn&rsquo;t have saved the soup. Masochists will note that transmission is next Wednesday, 6 June, when exactly 40 years ago, Ally MacLeod&rsquo;s team were reeling from Willie Johnston&rsquo;s drugs bust and about to lurch to a draw with football no-marks Iran.<br><br>Macari, now 68, was one of the Argentina &ldquo;bad boys&rdquo; who after the tournament would never play for his country again. It&rsquo;s poignant, then, that the first time we see him in the film he is inspiring one of commentator Archie Macpherson&rsquo;s most famous exclamations: Kenny Dalglish knocked the ball back to him in the centre circle and as Martin Buchan galloped down the right wing, Macari hit what was surely the sweetest, most instinctive, most raking left-foot pass of his career. Cue Archie: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an overlap!&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;The Wales game,&rdquo; he says of the crucial qualifier for &rsquo;78, &ldquo;and Kenny&rsquo;s wonderful header. It was a brilliant feeling to have won that match because we would be going to the finals as the only British representatives.&rdquo; That, though, would bring its own problems and pressures once the players were holed up in Cordoba.<br><br>Which Scotland squad contained the bonnier talents, &rsquo;74 or &rsquo;78? Somewhere in the land, between games in a World Cup not involving us, this will be debated. Bill Shankly is quoted in the documentary as saying that the Argentina-bound Scots, if they were to compete in England&rsquo;s old First Division, would have wrapped up the league by Christmas. Macari&rsquo;s party was plenty strong and he worried about not being on the plane. &ldquo;Although I played at Anfield I was thinking: &lsquo;Am I even going to make the big pool of 60?&rsquo; I was like a kid with a sticker album, only I seemed to have too many midfield players: &lsquo;[Don] Masson and [Bruce] Rioch are certainties. [Archie] Gemmill and [Asa] Hartford and [Graeme] Souness are bound to get in. Bloody hell&rsquo;.&rdquo;<br><br>Too many midfielders, too much hullabaloo. The World Cup came along at a vulnerable moment for the country. The old industries were dying and we were seeking a new, different and vivid expression of ourselves. The tournament, especially with no England present, provided it. Butchers sold their shops so they could follow the team across the ocean. Bedecked in tartan, some fans embarked on the great adventure by bicycle. The film shows residents of a hamlet digging a hole in the ground. Were they attempting to tunnel their way to South America? No, simply laying four miles of cabling so Knoydart could follow the games on TV.<br><br>What did Macari think of the pre-World Cup lap of honour around Hampden? &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t very comfortable with it, but looking back it allowed wee kids to see the players along with all the other fans who weren&rsquo;t able to make the big journey.&rdquo; As with much of Argentina &rsquo;78 the parade has been over-analysed, and at least that bus didn&rsquo;t break down, unlike the transfer from Buenos Aires to the squad&rsquo;s base. &ldquo;We all had to get out and push,&rdquo; laughs Macari. &ldquo;Can you imagine Gareth Southgate and his boys doing that in Russia this summer?&rdquo;<br><br>Scotland&rsquo;s impresario &ndash; PT McBarnum &ndash; was of course MacLeod. What did Macari think of him before Argentina and then afterwards? &ldquo;Oh, the same. My view didn&rsquo;t waver. Ally was a character like Tommy Doc [Docherty]. He was entertaining and a genuine football man who wanted to win games and for Scotland to give of their best.<br><br>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re going to ask me about preparations and whether we should have had Peru watched [the South Americans stunned Scotland in the opening match, winning 3-1 with flying wingers and outside-of-the-foot deftness by Teofilo Cubillas]. The younger generation might be wondering: &lsquo;Where were your tactical geniuses back then?&rsquo; They don&rsquo;t exist now, by the way, but we did have these great managers, guys like Jock, Shanks and [Matt] Busby. Football&rsquo;s big into analysis and stats and everything now but the greats managed players and that was Ally, too.&rdquo;<br><br>The second time we encounter Macari in the documentary is at the squad&rsquo;s Alta Gracia retreat where he&rsquo;s asking Masson and Joe Harper what would be reasonable for a World Cup bonus payment. This is followed by Macari being asked by a reporter how much he expected to make from the tournament. &ldquo;Buttons,&rdquo; he replies. He says now: &ldquo;Sure we talked about money. Any footballer who says he doesn&rsquo;t is a liar. You got paid a wage and if you won, there would be a bonus but in &rsquo;78, players were earning &pound;200 a week. Was representing the country not sufficient reward? I don&rsquo;t know, is it enough nowadays? The subject of money was bound to crop up. Of course it should have cropped up before we travelled and been sorted out then.&rdquo;<br><br>If you thought you knew all you ever needed to know about Argentina &rsquo;78 you might be shocked by the film when Derek Johnstone reveals the full horror of camp boredom. Stuck by the empty pool, the players would turn their frustrations on a colony of ants, flicking gravel at them to dislodge the leaves being borne on tiny backs. Maybe the squad placed bets on the outcomes; perhaps they also backed themselves to win their second group game.<br><br>First capped by Docherty, Macari had been a member of the Scotland team which ripped up Wembley in 1977, got involved in the scruffy winner that day, just as he was for the similarly ugly Twin Towers goal which brought Man U the FA Cup two weeks before, and was drafted into the national side for what would be the dire 1-1 with Iran, his 24th and final dark blue appearance.<br><br>Macari insists he didn&rsquo;t quit Scotland, rather they quit him. He&rsquo;d prompted seething at the SFA over a newspaper article criticising their organisation of the campaign. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t go running to the press; I had a regular column in The Sun and when the tournament was over for Scotland was asked to reflect on it. The SFA took the hump. [Secretary] Ernie Walker&rsquo;s response was something like: &lsquo;We&rsquo;re not going to punish Mr Macari by making him play for Scotland again&rsquo;. I was disappointed that was my last-ever game but in the column I&rsquo;d simply told it like it was.&rdquo;<br><br>Macari has had a tempestuous life. To end up at Man U he said &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Jock Stein and then &ldquo;no&rdquo; to Bill Shankly at Liverpool; not many do that. As Celtic boss he took Fergus McCann to court after his sacking but lost his savings in the action. &ldquo;Fergus wanted me out from day one. His method of communication was to write me a note and yet our offices were only 50 yards apart. I knew it was the wrong time to be there but anyone who&rsquo;d been brought up by the club, as I had been, would have jumped at the chance to manage them.&rdquo; Then as boss of Swindon Town he was fined for breaching FA rules on betting.<br><br>But events good and bad paled into insignificance for Macari following the tragedy which was to hit his family in 1999 when youngest son Jonathan, who&rsquo;d been with Nottingham Forest, took his own life. The language of football, its would-be triumphs and supposed disasters, won&rsquo;t have sounded more over-inflated than at that moment. Nothing comes close to losing a child.<br><br>It&rsquo;s ten years since Macari wrote about Jonathan&rsquo;s death in his autobiography. He said then that he blamed himself. He could have done more to help the lad. As a manager he&rsquo;d been careful to spot the signs when young players might have been experiencing difficulties &ndash; why hadn&rsquo;t he done this with his own son?<br><br>Does he still feel guilt? &ldquo;One of the things people say is: &lsquo;Time heals&rsquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t; nothing changes. You get older, the event gets older, but it doesn&rsquo;t go away. You question yourself. Every time you have a mad moment, which you try to keep to as few as possible, you&rsquo;ll do that. I think that must happen in all families who&rsquo;ve been through something similar. There would be something wrong with you if you didn&rsquo;t reflect on a loss, especially of a child, and have regrets.&rdquo;<br><br>The Macari Centre opened two years ago. He would love to be able to close it tomorrow and for homelessness not to exist but in the time the refuge has been in operation its reach and services have had to be expanded. It now caters for 30, three times the original figure, and provides three meals a day. I wonder if Macari was moved to act by his feelings over Jonathan&rsquo;s death. &ldquo;Maybe that had something to do with it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;As a parent when you lose a child, a billion things run through your mind. The one thing that&rsquo;s not going to happen, of course, is them coming back to you. So you think about what you could have done [to help] and then you might think: &lsquo;Who helped me in life?&rsquo; At Man U and Celtic I had brilliant mentors and in Big Jock I had the greatest of them all.&rdquo;<br><br>Macari thinks back to his Parkhead youth as a Quality Street kid and how he couldn&rsquo;t be even a minute late for training on Tuesday and Thursday nights because Stein was always standing at the door, counting in the striplings. He&rsquo;s laughing having remembered the night he tried to sneak a bottle of Coca-Cola past the boss and of course he was rumbled. &ldquo;Jock was teetotal but he didn&rsquo;t even approve of fizzy drinks. He poured it down the sink then uttered the immortal words: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll Coca-Cola ye&rsquo;. Like Stein, Macari has never touched alcohol.<br><br>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have achieved what I did in football without guys like Jock and one day, seeing so many people sleeping rough, I thought to myself: &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s helping them? What are they ever going to be able to achieve in their lives?&rsquo; I had a friend on the local council. He used to be a journalist who, when I was playing, was always pestering me for stories. I said to him: &lsquo;It&rsquo;s payback time. You must have an empty building which could be used as a shelter&rsquo;. I thought setting it up would be my only involvement but here I am. I&rsquo;m trying to help the folk get their lives back on track. I don&rsquo;t preach to them. I want them to â€¨know they can rely on me and â€¨trust me.&rdquo;<br><br>Such commitment takes time. Macari won&rsquo;t leave the refuge and head for home until after 10pm. Then he&rsquo;ll stay up for telly coverage of Scotland&rsquo;s return to South America, the national team&rsquo;s first visit to the continent since that ill-fated excursion 40 years ago. &ldquo;They need to get back on track, too,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but I always watch their games, waiting for things to change. I want a magician to come along and restore us to what we used to be, producing unbelievable footballers.&rdquo;<br><br>l Scotland &rsquo;78: A Love Story is on BBC1 Scotland on 6 June at 9pm.  </div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><br><br></div></div>
