Joe Logan didn&#39;t make it through himself, but Charlie went on to have a long great career at Celtic.<br><br>The inside-forward made his Hoops debut in a 1-0 <a href="/page/League+Cup" target="_self">League Cup</a> victory at home to Raith Rovers in August <a href="/page/1959" target="_self">1959</a> and he went on to make 171 appearances in the major competitions and net 32 goals in a 12 year Parkhead career.<br><br>An assured if unspectacular player Charlie - the cousin of <font color="#333333"><a href="/page/Crerand%2C+Pat" target="_self">Paddy Crerand</a> </font>they both attended Holyrood Secondary in the South Side of Glasgow - Charlie may have lacked pace and aggression but he was a wonderful passer of the ball and possessed a thunderous shot. He was also always willing to work for his team-mates and throughout his Celtic career he remained a popular figure with fans and players alike.<br><br>The problem with Gallagher, in the eyes of a number of supporters, was  that he  lacked a little bit of devilment, some dig. He wasn&rsquo;t a  ball-winner, but still made it up with other qualities. He himself has admitted that he felt that Jock Stein never favoured him, possibly as he was from the Kelly&#39;s Kids and was favoured by Celtic Chairman. Possibly this might have been down to insecurity too, there&#39;s only ever 11 opening slots and there was a lot of strong competition.<br><br>He was unfortunate that during his time at Celtic he had to compete with the magnificen<font color="#333333">t <a href="/page/Auld%2C+Bertie" target="_self">Bertie Auld</a></font> for a starting berth but when he did turn out for the first team Charlie often showed his ample ability. Gallagher&#39;s first notable game for the club was probably the 3-1 Parkhead win over Rangers in September 1964 when a much unfancied Celtic triumphed by 3-1 in heavy conditions. <br><br>Charlie suffered from inconsistency in his early years and was tried in several positions when Jimmy McGrory was manager without really settling into a set role. However the arrival of Jock Stein as manager brought out the best in him and Stein always played him in a modern 2 man midfield system. He had a fine game in the 1965 Scottish Cup final victory against Dunfermline when McNeill scored the winner from a glorious corner from Gallagher. Ironically he also took the corner from which McNeill again scored the winner against Vojvodina in the European Cup quarter final tie of March 1967 and Charlie could count himself unlucky not to have played in Lisbon.<br><br>He had a wonderful shot with both feet and put it to good effect in January 1966 against Rangers with a magnificent effort in Celtic&#39;s stunning 5-1 victory. Charlie was capable of playing on both sides of the field as he was also comfortable playing on the left which made him the ideal replacement for Bertie Auld on occasions.<br><br>After an injury to Auld in February 1968, Charlie had a fine run of form in the tight championship race between Celtic and Rangers which Celtic won narrowly and he was instrumental in this success with some great performances. Basically season 1967-78 was &quot;Gallagher&#39;s season&quot; where he helped to control the midfield, win the ball and supply ball to the more attacking players. <br><br>Charlie was a real footballer, appreciated by the purists amongst the Celtic support but was not a keen tackler preferring to leave those chores to the likes of Brogan and Murdoch. He moved to Dumbarton in 1970 and gave great service to the Sons, especially in the 1970 League Cup semi final and replay when Dumbarton, inspired by Charlie ran Celtic close, narrowly losing 4-3. The Celtic fans gave him a rapturous reception in both matches.<br><br>The son of Donegal parents Charlie was a Republic of Ireland international, and was the first Scots born player to play for the Republic of Ireland when he travelled to Ankara on 22 February 1967 to represent Ireland against Turkey.<br><br>He retired from playing in April 1973.<font size="2"><br></font><br>He may not have been in Lisbon but as he humorously put it, in the bigger picture he was still part of something special: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;For years it galled me that the only thing people remembered me for was  two corner kicks. Then my wife said: Your name is in history for  that&#39;.&quot;<br></i></blockquote><br><b>Post-Playing</b><br>He worked as a scout for Celtic from April 1976 to April 1978 and later as a taxi driver in Glasgow. The earnings of today&#39;s football players, where wages are talked of in millions, must now seem like a different world. His wages were &pound;45 per week at the beginning of his professional career.<br><br>Although Charlie Gallagher was not always a regular in the Celtic line-up he was a reliable man to call upon and he played a great part in Celtic&#39;s early success during Stein&#39;s reign and was enormously popular with the Celtic fans. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career<br></h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br>(goals)<br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1958-70</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  106</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  23</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  29</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  13</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  171</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals</td><td align="center" width="16%">17</td><td align="center" width="16%">4</td><td align="center" width="16%">11</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">32</td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>European Cup   <br></b>  <ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/The+Road+to+Lisbon" target="_self">1966-67</a></font></li></ul><b>Scottish League <br></b>  <ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/1966" target="_self">1965-66</a>, <a href="/page/1967" target="_self">1966-67</a>, <a href="/page/1968" target="_self">1967-68</a></font></li></ul><b>Scottish Cup   <br></b>  <ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/Scottish+Cup+1964-65" target="_self">1965</a></font></li></ul><b>Scottish League Cup</b>   <br><ul>  <li>  <font size="2"><a href="/page/1966" target="_self">1965-66</a></font></li></ul><b>  </b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Gallacher%2C+Charlie+-+Pics" target="_self">Player pictures</a></li></ul>  <h3>  Articles</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Charlie+Gallacher+-+%22The+Nearly+Man%22" target="_self">Charlie Gallacher - &quot;The Nearly Man&quot;</a></li><li><a href="/page/Kelly%27s+Kids" target="_self">Kelly&#39;s Kids</a><br></li></ul><h3>Books</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Books%3A+Charlie+Gallacher%2C+What+a+Player+%282016%29" target="_self" title="Charlie Gallacher, What a Player">Charlie Gallacher, What a Player</a> by David Potter (2016)</li></ul><b>  </b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Charlie Gallagher: a bhoy&#39;s own story </h3><h3><font size="2"><img align="right" alt="Charlie Gallacher" height="509" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Y1vAPEeu5uR4tFVVPQ3BGg141239/GW268H509" title="Charlie Gallacher" width="268"></font></h3>Joe Sullivan (CelticFC.net)<br><br>AS part of a series taken from the Celtic View, we  have been taking a trip down memory lane with a host of past Celtic  favourites to get their own personal take on what it was like to pull on  the Hoops. Next up is Charlie Gallagher.<br><br>HE&rsquo;S the man  who kick-started a decade of dominance for the Hoops that led to the  creation of the modern-day Celtic Football Club we all know and love  today.<br><br>It was Charlie Gallagher who delivered the corner  met by the head of Billy McNeill to score the crucial winner in the  1965 Scottish Cup final 3-2 win over Dunfermline and from then on in &ndash;  the club simply didn&rsquo;t look back.<br><br>Two years later, another vital  corner kick played a major part in the club&rsquo;s history as, in the dying  seconds of the European Cup quarter-final against Vojvodina with the tie  heading for a play-off in Rotterdam, Gallagher again swung over a  dead-eye ball that Cesar met once more to propel the Celts to Lisbon  glory.<br><br>A year after Lisbon, Charlie also took delight in watching  his cousin and former Celtic team-mate, Paddy Crerand, also lift the  European Cup with Manchester United.<br><br>Today we take a walk down memory lane with a man who played a remarkable part in Celtic&rsquo;s history.<br><br>My earliest substantial memory of Celtic is a very easy one.  I was actually playing schools football with Holyrood at the time and  the guy who did the announcements at Celtic was John Murphy and he was  one of our schoolteachers. He always had me kind of lined up to go to  Celtic and when Celtic played Manchester United in a benefit game for  Cheshire Homes in April of 1956, I was a ballboy. I was 15-years-old at  the time and the game finished 2-2 in what was the early days of the  Busby Babes. That was the first time I really remember going to Celtic  Park as I had always played football on a Saturday and the ground was a  bit of a trek from the Gorbals. If there was time, I would go to Clyde  or Third Lanark games as they were a lot nearer home. So that was my  first real experience of Celtic Park and it was such a buzz being a  ballboy behind the goals and watching my heroes, as well as Man United  players like Duncan Edwards, just yards away.<br><br>There have  been a few highlights in my career and I realise an obvious one would be  just being part of the squad that won the European up in 1967 but that  possibly a kind of trite answer that most of the Lions would give you. But  I think there is no bigger highlight than making your debut for Celtic &ndash;  high points just don&rsquo;t come any better than that. Mine&rsquo;s was actually a  League Cup game on August 22, 1959 against Raith Rovers and it&rsquo;s a game  that I&rsquo;ll always remember to my dying day. There wasn&rsquo;t a big crowd  there (24,000) and we won 1-0 thanks to an own goal. There was a poor  crowd because the team was having a bad, bad time. In fact in the late  &lsquo;50s we were having a terrible time but I remember that Celtic heroes  like Bobby Evans and Bertie Peacock were playing alongside me and wee  Bertie Auld in his first period with Celtic so that, I think, would be  one of my highlights.<br><br>As I said earlier, making my debut  for Celtic was a memorable highlight of my time at the club but the  highlight of my career apart from the Celtic was being capped for the  Republic of Ireland. Because I was brought up in an Irish  household, my mum and dad were Irish as were all my relatives so,  although I was born in Glasgow and brought up as a Glaswegian, most of  my summers were spent in Ireland. It was a source of immense pride that I  was the first Scots-born player to play for the Republic. I was  actually the second player born outwith Ireland to play for the country.  The first was a guy called John Dempsey who played with Chelsea but I  was the first Scot. The first game was out in Turkey and it was a  nightmare while the second was in Dublin against Czechoslovakia and it  was tremendous. We lost both games, though, as Irish football at that  time was only starting out compared to recent years although all the  players were well-known names from English clubs. Czechoslovakia were  one of the top teams in the world at the time with players like Masopust  and other top names in their ranks and the Irish set-up was a bit  haphazard. We would just meet up a couple of days before the game, not  like now when there is about a week&rsquo;s training, but I played two games  for Ireland and I&rsquo;m always going to be remembered for that. And Big Jock  made me captain for the next Celtic game in celebration.<br><br>The  biggest disappointment for me, and I would it would probably be the  same for the majority of players that played in the game, was our  European Cup-Winners&rsquo; Cup semi-final in 1964 against MTK Budapest.  It was in April and we beat them 3-0 at Celtic Park so to score three  goals at home and go away to Budapest and get beat 4-0 was ridiculous.  When you go away from home you&rsquo;re supposed to play defensively but our  chairman at the time wasn&rsquo;t interested in us playing defensively. So we  played all-out attack and you know the rest. When you look at the team  from that game, the vast majority of them were still there in 1967. So  we had the makings of a good side ready to come through and that side,  obviously with one or two additions to it, made it to Lisbon. So 1964  could well have witnessed our first European trophy (Sporting Lisbon  beat MTK 1-0 after a 3-3 draw) when you think about it so I think that  was a real major disappointment.<br><br>My other favourite ground, away from Celtic Park, was, believe it or not, Kilmarnock.  It may be a strange choice but Rugby Park always had a great playing  surface. I played there with Kilmarnock Amateurs for two or three years  and I actually trained on that ground and it has been well quoted as the  best playing surface in Scotland. While games were being called off all  over the place, the match always seemed to go ahead there because it  was a good sandy surface. It was also a big wide open pitch and I  absolutely loved that park. Even though I was training with Celtic, I  was also training with Kilmarnock amateurs when Celtic legend Malky  MacDonald was the manager just before Willie Waddell and we trained with  the part-timers on a Tuesday night so I got used to that pitch. It was a  magnificent surface for playing on as it held the rain and the water  disappeared from it. Joe McBride played with Kilmarnock Amateurs a year  ahead of me and we always talked about how brilliant the training was  and how fabulous the surface was. That&rsquo;s all you want as a footballer, a  good ground to play on.<br><br>Although I got to know him in later years, when I started out playing Bobby Shearer of Rangers was my toughest opponent. When  I made my derby debut against Rangers at Ibrox away back in 1962 he  came up to me and said, &lsquo;All the best Charlie, have a good game &ndash; but  the first time you run by me I&rsquo;ll break your legs!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Ya wee fat  so-and-so, you&rsquo;ll have to catch me first!&rsquo; Later on in life when I got  to know him a wee bit better through meeting at Old Crock games, I  reminded him about that and he said that he used to say that to all the  young right-wingers to try and frighten them but I don&rsquo;t know if it  worked or not.<br><br>Although I never played very much in the  same Celtic team as my cousin Paddy Crerand, we used to always be on  holiday in the same part of Ireland at the same time and we were always  playing football there together so playing at Celtic Park was just a  continuation of what we did on our holidays in Ireland together. We  played a lot of football over in Ireland when we shouldn&rsquo;t have been  playing! There were a lot of summer cup competitions and we shouldn&rsquo;t  have been playing in them because, of course, we were registered over  here but we were none the wiser and didn&rsquo;t realise we were doing  anything wrong. In fact, I remember playing in the semi-final of a  summer cup competition one year for the local team and we had about  eight Scottish professionals against a side from Coleraine &ndash; their  captain was none other than Celtic team-mate Bertie Peacock who had all  his Irish pals playing for them. But Paddy was a very good player, in  fact we used to go to training together every day form the Gorbals  because he lived in Crown Street and I lived in Cumberland Street just  around the corner so we&rsquo;d walk down and get a lift from Alec Byrne or  jump in the tramcar. So I didn&rsquo;t play alongside Paddy that much but when  I first went to see Celtic I was watching guys like Bobby Evans, Bertie  Peacock and Neilly Mochan and I felt immense pride that I was able to  play in the same team alongside such Hoops legends. In recent years it  would be like a youngster coming in to play with the likes of Neil  Lennon after watching them from the sidelines.<br><br>I have to  admit that it&rsquo;s a bit of a sore point and quite sad that people only  seem to remember those two corners against Dunfermline and Vojvodina. I  remember scoring a couple of good goals myself but people always bring  this up whenever Big Billy and I are together but, I suppose, it is nice  to be remembered for that. It&rsquo;s something that will never fade from  people&rsquo;s memories as long as they live as, for people who were at the  games, they were like &lsquo;Kennedy moments&rsquo;. I still watch them on  television. I think the cup final goal was the most important as it was  probably the most important game for the club because Lisbon may never  have happened if we had lost the cup final. Everything changed all round  after that with nine-in-a-row and all that went with it. That was the  thing that set us off.<br><br>I honestly do not know what career I would have taken up if I hadn&rsquo;t been involved in football. I  was actually reasonably clever at school but I surmised that I was  going to be a footballer from an early age. When I left school I went  for an interview and got an apprenticeship as an electrical engineer up  in London Road near Celtic Park &ndash; but come the Monday morning I thought  &lsquo;No&rsquo; and never turned up for it. I had no inclinations to be anything at  all other than a footballer. Even at school, I felt at an early age  that I was being pushed towards football. In fact Alex Ferguson  mentioned this at the Joe McBride Dinner the other week. I played  against Alex when I was at Holyrood and we were both 15-years-old  playing with the Under-18s so at an early age when you are being pushed  into an older team, you feel as if you&rsquo;ve got something. I was training  with Kilmarnock on a Tuesday night and Celtic on a Thursday so at that  time I was hoping to be a professional.<br><br>If I had to give  some advice to a youngster who wants to be a Celtic player I would have  to say that it is a lot harder to be footballer that it was in my day. I  don&rsquo;t know if they are fitter but they appear to be fitter and the game  is played at a much faster pace. So kids would have to look to the  likes of Aiden McGeady, who has got himself super-fit to the level that  you need to be nowadays. I think we played a bit slower in our day and  moved the ball about a bit more but it&rsquo;s a lot quicker now. In our day,  players tended to get apprenticeships over and done with, like Jim Craig  did, but when you want to be a professional footballer you&rsquo;ve just got  to get down to it and fitness is of utmost importance these days. That&rsquo;s  something that was only introduced at Celtic when Jock Stein arrived,  as before that the training was a joke at Celtic Park as we were never  as fit as the other teams. So get your head down, get fit as fiddle and  if you&rsquo;re a good player you&rsquo;ll get there.<br><b>  </b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>(Official site)</h3>Mark Henderson<br>IT was 70 years ago today (Wednesday) that  Charlie Gallagher was born into the Irish stronghold of the Gorbals.  Like many brought up in that area of Glasgow, he dreamed of one day  wearing the Hoops.<br><br>When the chance came, not even the persuasive  powers of Willie Waddell at Kilmarnock could change his mind, and he was  soon being put through his paces at night under the dim Paradise  lights.<br><br>Supporters who watched him performthere for the next 12 years would be thankful for his single-mindedness.<br><br>&ldquo;When  I first joined Celtic, I actually started training with them when I was  16 or 17,&rdquo; he told this week&#39;s Celtic View. &ldquo;I was training with  Kilmarnock as well, as I played with Kilmarnock Amateurs too.<br><br>So  I was training two nights a week, once at Celtic and once at  Kilmarnock. But I think Celtic heard about me through John Murphy, who  was the announcer at the start of the game and also my PE teacher at  Holyrood.<br><br>&ldquo;He realised I was down at Kilmarnock as there were a  couple of other Holyrood boys down there as well and he was desperate to  get me up to Celtic, so he got me up training.<br><br>&ldquo;Although I was  at Celtic, I was still at Kilmarnock and they were trying to sign me as  well. Willie Waddell was the manager there at the time, and I told him I  had an offer from Celtic and he couldn&rsquo;t make me change my mind.<br><br>&ldquo;He  realised it himself and said he was the same himself when he was a  young guy when Rangers were after him and to be fair he never pursued  it. He just said on you go and all the best to you.And that&#39;s what I  remember.<br><br>&ldquo;I went up to Celtic and we just trained at night. I&#39;m  sure you&#39;ve heard the story often that there was only a wee light at  each corner of the stand and we were training in that. And when I went  full-time, I signed on my 18th birthday in 1958, and that&rsquo;s when it  really started.&rdquo;<br><br>Gallagher would remain at Celtic for over a  decade as the club was transformed from perennial underachievers into  one of best teams in the world under Jock Stein.<br><br>During that era,  the silky midfielder would make a massive contribution to those  achievements, making over 200 appearances in the greatest Hoops side  ever assembled, and narrowly missing out on a place in the European Cup  final in Lisbon.<br><br>He also scored 32 goals for Celtic, including  one on his birthday in 1962. Although unable to remember that particular  strike, summoning up the memory of his most prized Hoops goal is  certainly an easier matter. Supporters who were there when it happened,  though, may have greater difficulty in their recollections.<br><br>&ldquo;My favourite was obviously the one against Rangers, in the 5-1 victory in 1965,&rdquo; said Gallagher.<br><br>&ldquo;They  scored first and then we hammered them. It was a bad, foggy day and I  don&rsquo;t think half the supporters saw the goals. They all went into the  Celtic End, so they would have seen them but I am not sure about those  who were in The Jungle.&rdquo;<br><br>His outstanding performances for Celtic  also saw him being the first Scottish-born player to represent Ireland, a  record he remains proud of.<br><br>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the highlight of my life  but it was one the top moments in my life, particularly my second cap  which was in Dublin against the team that was running riot in Europe,  Czechoslovakia,&rdquo; he said. <br><br>&ldquo;They were one of the top teams in the  world at the time. To do that and be reminded every time I get  introduced that I was the first Scots-born player to play for the  Republic is something I am quite happy with.

Now 74, the former Celtic playmaker of the 1960s was the first Scots-born player to play for Ireland, though it proved a brief flirtation.<br><br>Gallagher&rsquo;s parents, Daniel and Annie, were Irish born and bred, from Donegal. Daniel Gallagher was a &ldquo;navvy&rdquo; who took any work he could get, eventually relocating with his young wife to Glasgow and the febrile congestion of the Gorbals. &ldquo;We were all there &mdash; me, my family, aunts and uncles, all of them Irish,&rdquo; recalled Gallagher yesterday. &ldquo;The place was steeped in Ireland.&rdquo;<br><br>Gallagher was thus born in the heart of Glasgow, and as an 18-year-old was spotted as a promising footballer by Celtic. He played for the club throughout the 1960s, remembered as a fine passer and &ldquo;a player with intelligence&rdquo;, though a difficult relationship with Jock Stein meant it took Gallagher 11 seasons to muster 171 appearances for the club. But it was on the international stage &mdash; and for Ireland, not Scotland &mdash; that Gallagher made his historic impact, in February 1967, after a significant rule change in international football.<br><br>&ldquo;Sean Fallon, who was Jock Stein&rsquo;s assistant, came up to me one day and said, &lsquo;Charlie, I need to have a word&rsquo;,&rdquo; Gallagher recalls. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;aye, sure, what is it?&rsquo; I thought Sean had some transfer news for me, good or bad. Sean says, &lsquo;how would you like to play for Ireland?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t, Sean, I&rsquo;m Scottish.&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;no, no, they&rsquo;ve changed the rules . . . your parents are Irish, you can play for them.&rsquo; I told Sean that, in that case, I&rsquo;d be delighted to play for Ireland.&rdquo;<br><br>Two fateful games became the beginning and the end of Gallagher&rsquo;s international career. He played for Ireland on a chaotic night against Turkey in Ankara on February 22 1967, and then against the former Czechoslovakia three months later at Dalymount Park.<br><br>&ldquo;The whole thing never really worked out for me,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d flown to London to meet my new Ireland team-mates, and found the guys gathered in a bar. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it &mdash; I came from a football background where Jock Stein would kill you if he saw you in a bar. I went up and introduced myself and they said, &lsquo;what are you having to drink?&rsquo; I told them I wasn&rsquo;t drinking anything, because that&rsquo;s just how it was at Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;There was a young lad in that squad &mdash; like me, a newcomer &mdash; called Al Finucane and he took me aside. He said, &lsquo;look, Charlie, you might find this a bit difficult . . . the Dublin boys are very clannish, they all stick together.&rsquo; So it proved quite a tough experience for me.&rdquo;<br><br>Gallagher&rsquo;s Ireland career was over before it had scarcely got started. Looking back, he says, there was good and bad in his history-making experience.<br><br>&ldquo;The truth is, I wasn&rsquo;t much help to them on the pitch. Maybe they thought I&rsquo;d be a fantastic player, coming from Celtic, but I didn&rsquo;t offer much in my two games. And it just fizzled out after that. I went long periods not getting into the Celtic team &mdash; this was the Lisbon Lions era &mdash; and Ireland just seemed to forget about me.<br><br>&ldquo;But one thing it did do was make the Celtic support take me to their hearts all the more. They loved the fact that I&rsquo;d played for Ireland &mdash; many of them were of Irish descent themselves. They loved me for it.&rdquo;<br><br>Back in Glasgow, Gallagher had one more battle to do &mdash; with Jock Stein. No matter how well he played, he says, Stein was cool towards him.<br><br>&ldquo;In terms of football management, Stein was one of the best ever. I have no argument with that at all. But I didn&rsquo;t care for his attitude to me.<br><br>&ldquo;I was a &lsquo;Kelly Kid&rsquo;, one of the lads signed for Celtic by Bob Kelly. I don&rsquo;t know if Stein objected to this &mdash; me not being one of his signings &mdash; and whether it made him dislike me a wee bit. He tried to move me out of Celtic a few times, and finally did after season 1967-68, which had been my best-ever season for Celtic, a great championship-winning season, after which I hardly kicked a ball again for Celtic. All I can say is, Stein made me feel very frustrated.&rdquo;<br><br>Today Gallagher lives quietly in Glasgow. Who will he support this evening? &ldquo;Oh, Ireland,&rdquo; he says hesitantly. &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t want Scotland to get any doing.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><br><br></div>
