The signing was typical of Burns, a man never afraid to look further afield to uncover exciting attacking talent. <br><br>When Di Canio arrived at Celtic he joined a cosmopolitan squad that already boasted the considerable talents of Dutch striker <a href="/page/Van+Hooijdonk%2C+Pierre" target="_self">Pierre Van Hoijdonk</a>, German international <a href="/page/Thom%2C+Andreas" target="_self">Andreas Thom</a> and Portugal&rsquo;s <a href="/page/Cadete%2C+Jorge" target="_self">Jorge Cadette</a>. Together with Pierre &amp; Jorge, the three were mockingly labelled as the &#39;<a href="/page/Three+Amigos" target="_self">Three Amigos</a>&#39; by chairman Fergus McCann.<br><br>The  arrival of the gifted but highly temperamental Italian not only  provided Celtic with an abundance of riches in attack but sent out a  clear signal of how Burns wanted his rebuilt Celtic to play. The fans  were licking their lips in anticipation.<br><br>In some ways they were  not to be disappointed. Celtic were sensational at times that season and  in pure football terms could look streets ahead of any of their  domestic rivals. But while their attacking forays were often a joy to  watch the team was all too frequently undone by a defence too prone to  making elementary and costly mistakes.<br><br>For his part Di Canio was a  sensation. An outrageously gifted player, the skilful Italian rapidly  became the darling of the fans. His flair was coupled with a real  cutting edge which meant that more often than not his audacious ability  not only entertained but produced that vital end product.<br><br>As is  so often the case with players of Di Canio&rsquo;s talent there was a real  arrogance to his play and demeanour. That arrogance could make for great  viewing as he teased the opposition but it didn&rsquo;t always warm him to  his team mates. <br><br>In one of his early training sessions at Celtic  Di Canio stormed off the practice ground vowing never to return. The  catalyst of this tantrum was the ability of his own team-mates &ndash; or  rather lack of ability. After one stray pass too many Di Canio had  enough. He stormed off the pitch and let Burns know in no uncertain  terms that he thought the calibre of player he was asked to work with  was beneath him. He may have had a point but it was still uncalled for.<br><br>There  can be few players who have ever been as animated on the football field  as Di Canio but these regular displays of emotion only endeared him  further to a support desperate for a hero to finally bring an end the  dominance of an all conquering Rangers just one championship away from  equalling Celtic&rsquo;s record of nine titles in a row.<br><br>But even with  Di Canio &ndash; either up front or out wide - Celtic far too often slipped up  when it came to the crunch. The First Team lost all four league  encounters with Rangers, and although the Italian scored a penalty in a  2-0 <a href="/page/Scottish+Cup" target="_self">Scottish Cup</a>  quarter-final win over the Ibrox club the Hoops crashed out of the  tournament after a replayed semi-final, embarrassingly losing out 1-0 to  First Division <a href="/page/Falkirk" target="_self">Falkirk</a>.<br><br>For  all his talent and fight when it came to these crucial encounters it  has to be said that Di Canio did not produce when it mattered most.<br><br>That  Falkirk match signalled the end of Burns as Celtic manager and was the  beginning of the end of Di Canio as a Bhoy. The Italian &ndash; who prior to  Milan had played for Terrana, Lazio and Juventus &ndash; came to Glasgow with a  reputation as a hot head.<br><br>It was a reputation he lived up to and  his discipline on the pitch was poor, too often finding himself in  confrontation with opponents and referees. He was labelled &lsquo;fiery&rsquo; by  the tabloids and there could be little argument with such a description.<br><br>Despite  the tags, Di Canio enjoyed a good relationship with Burns but when the  manager was sacked he saw an opportunity to engineer his own departure  from the club. Paolo was vocal in his disappointment in the axing of  Burns and when the following pre-season came around he remained in Rome  rather than return to Glasgow. He stated that a &quot;<i>little problem</i>&quot;  had emerged regarding his contract with the club. On the one hand, he  says that the club promised to revise his contract upwards if he had a  good first season whilst the chairman says there was no such agreement.<br><br>A  cat and mouse game thus ensued between the club and the player with  accusation and counter-accusation flying to and thro. Celtic vowed that  Di Canio had signed a contract and would not be sold.<br><br>Just days  after stating Di Canio was not for sale the player &ndash; in the infamous  words of Celtic&rsquo;s then Director of Football Jock Brown &ndash; was &quot;traded&quot; in  a &pound;4.5 million deal with Premiership side Sheffield Wednesday which saw  Dutch winger <a href="/page/Blinker%2C+Regi" target="_self">Regi Blinker</a>  coming to Parkhead. A very poor trade as it was to prove in time. Jock  Brown even tried to use it as vindication of his ability in his position  but all it did was make us laugh and/or cringe.<br><br><img align="right" alt="Paolo Di Canio - Kerrydale Street" height="293" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/bTY6MAG5_mm4a6NR4iLSlQ133559/GW153H293" title="Paolo Di Canio - Kerrydale Street" width="153">Di  Canio&rsquo;s acrimonious departure from Celtic undoubtedly split the  support. Many were furious that the club did not do more to keep such a  uniquely gifted player. Chairman and majority shareholder <a href="/page/Fergus+McCann" target="_self">Fergus McCann</a>  took the bulk of the flak. But the man who rescued the Hoops from the  disastrous regime of the White/Kelly axis was not one to take such  matters lying down.<br><br>He launched a blistering attack on Di Canio,  Van Hoijdonk and Cadette &ndash; all who departed under a cloud of financial  wrangling &ndash; branding them &#39;<i><a href="/page/Three+Amigos" target="_self">The Three Amigos</a></i>&#39;  and blasting what he viewed as their money grabbing antics. While the  initial sympathy of some may have been with Di Canio the passing of time  has seen the vast majority of the support firmly in McCann&rsquo;s camp. <br><br>Consequently,  for all his wonderful skill, the nature of Di Canio&rsquo;s departure means  that memories of him in the Hoops now leave a rather bitter taste in the  mouth for many. <br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>The Italian went on to  make a major impact in the Premiership firstly with Sheffield Wednesday  and then West Ham and to a much lesser extent Charlton. He of course  enhanced his image as a hot head further while in Sheffield with his  infamous but comical push on ref Paul Allcock.<br><br>But it says  everything about Di Canio&rsquo;s ability that despite that notorious incident  he will be remembered in England foremost as a truly gifted player.  Despite being supposedly linked by the rumour mills with Manchester  United on a number of occasions Di Canio&rsquo;s career down south was  restricted to the Premiership&rsquo;s more mediocre outfits. Consequently his  only honour was a Goal of the Season award while with the Hammers.<br><br>He  returned to Italy and Lazio &ndash; his beloved boyhood team &ndash; in 2004 at the  age of 36. Now home in Rome another ugly side to his nature was to rear  its head. <br><br>While in England, Di Canio revealed in his  autobiography that like many Lazio fans he had far-right wing views and  admitted his admiration for wartime Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.  Now at Lazio, Di Canio saw fit to express these political feelings by  giving a Nazi salute to the Rome club&rsquo;s notorious right-wing supporters  on a number of occasions, sparking outrage around the football world. He  claimed that he&#39;s a fascist but not a racist! In many ways showed that  he just followed and jumped on any cause, and his politics were simply  very crude and populist, although in this case he&#39;d fallen for a very  nasty strand.<br><br>These antics and the player&rsquo;s subsequent defence of  his actions have made Di Canio a bit of a darling of the neo-fascist  movement in his home land. Had his political leanings been known during  his time in Glasgow it is likely his relationship with the Celtic  support would have deteriorated rather rapidly, and he would have been a  person non grata and punted. If his views were clear before he even  signed, Celtic would have steered well clear of him.<br><br>These  despicable shows of support of fascism have further isolated Di Canio  from a Celtic support which for a very short time worshipped him. Now he  is a figure loathed almost universally by the Celtic fans. In total Di  Canio scored 15 goals in 38 appearances for Celtic. He will always be  remembered as a wonderfully gifted (albeit greedy) footballer but alas  also as a rather pathetic person with diabolical political sympathies.<br><br>In  2014, he tried to put his name forward for the Celtic managerial role,  but thankfully he was never in the running or even considered. It was  just another PR stunt by Di Canio for attention to keep his name in the  papers. In recent seasons, he had been very controversially hired as  manager of Sunderland &amp; Swindon, both were very poor spells and  there was a serious backlash from many on his appointment in those  roles. <br><br>In 2016, he was removed from Sky Sports Italia after  showing off a fascist tattoo of Mussolini that he had covering his back.  It was quite despicable, and pathetic.

That&#39;s because in Scotland it&#39;s always a two horse  race, and by hurting us, they were helping Rangers.&#39;<br><b>Paolo di Canio, 2000</b><br><br>&#39;There  was hatred in the Old Firm and I soaked it up. I used it to my  advantage. I knew perfectly well it was about religion and while, I did  not understand or wish to get involved in the dispute, I would feed off  it.&#39;<br><b>Paolo di Canio, 2000</b><br><br>&quot;What I don&#39;t like is how 90% of refs in Scotland are Protestant and I am playing for a Catholic club. They are shameless.&quot;<br><b>Paolo di Canio</b><br><br>&quot;When they attacked we were four players down.&quot;<br><b>Tommy  Burns on fielding Paolo di Canio, Jorge Cadette, Andy Thom and Piere  van Hooijdonk in a UEFA Cup game defeat against Hamburg, 1996 </b><br><br>  &ldquo;I had a confrontation with Tommy because I was upset in a training   session and I was ready to leave. But he came to me and hugged me like a   brother with an energy that was an inspiration to me. He was like my  older brother, he made me feel like a part of the family.&rdquo; <br><b>Di Canio on Tommy Burns</b><br><br>&quot;I&#39;ve said all down the line that our position is that Paolo is not for sale.&quot;<br><b>General Manager Jock Brown on Paolo Di Canio 1997</b><br><br>&quot;He  (Di Canio) wasn&#39;t sold. He was traded. The only way to get (Regi)  Blinker was to involve Di Canio. He was used as a trading tool to get  Blinker.&quot;<br><b>Jock Brown 1997</b><br><br>&quot;As for di Canio I only have  one memory of him. Celtic were playing Hearts and won a penalty. Paolo  took it and scored - then got sent off before the game could be  re-started. It summed him up!  <br>  &quot;I&#39;m not surprised by what&#39;s  happened to any of them. What DOES surprise me is someone is willing to  pay to take trouble off your hands.&quot;  <br><b>Chairman Fergus McCann on Paolo Di Canio (1998)</b><br><br>  &quot;I have managed a few nutters in my time, but Di Canio takes the biscuit.&quot;<br><b>Ron Atkinson (Apr 27, 1998)</b><br><br>&quot;Paolo  di Canio was the best player I&#39;ve ever managed and possibly the best  player I ever will manage. He was also the most passionate footballer  I&#39;ve ever come across.<br><b>Former Celtic manager Tommy Burns (Sept 26, 1998)</b><br><br>&quot;I  want to be at Celtic for the rest of my career. I love the club and I  love the fans, too. They&#39;ve been incredible to me. I love Glasgow as  well.&quot;<br><b>Di Canio after being named Scotland&#39;s Player of the Year.(May 16, 1997)</b><br><br>&quot;It  saddens me that he suggests he might have played his last game for  Celtic. In that case, the world of football will be denied his supreme  talents for a period of three years because he will not be playing for  anyone else in that time.&quot;<br><b>Celtic general manager Jock Brown as their relationship with Di Canio rapidly starts to disintegrate.

You won, you maybe even won season.&quot;<br><b>Paolo di Canio, 1997</b><br><br>&quot;Professional  people like Wim Jansen and like me don&#39;t want to work for these people.  We remember what has happened and then we say to McCann I don&#39;t want to  play for you, you can **** off&quot;<br><b>Paolo di Canio, 1998</b><br><br>&quot;I  am fascinated by Mussolini. I think he was a deeply misunderstood  individual. He deceived people. His actions were often vile. But all  this was motivated by a higher purpose.&quot;<br><b>Paolo di Canio biog (2000)</b><br><br>&quot;Paolo  Di Canio was quite someone to have  around. He was a fantastic  footballer anyway but also the  hardest-training foreign player I have  ever come across. His attitude to  hard work and training was  immense.&quot;Paolo also liked to look good. At Celtic, he&rsquo;d spend so much  time in front of the mirror, it was almost like he was having a  relationship with it. Man in the mirror: Di Canio was always admiring  his own reflection He&rsquo;d spend 10 minutes looking at himself, preening  himself, gelling his hair back and shaving his chest. &#39;Bella Figa&rdquo; he&rsquo;d  say, admiring himself. &ldquo;My mother gave birth to a beautiful baby&#39;. &#39;Get  off the mirror, Paolo. Give someone else a chance, yeah&#39; was our  response.&quot;<br><b>Alan Stubbs (2013)<br><br></b>&quot;I don&#39;t vote, I haven&#39;t voted for 14 years. Italian politicians &mdash; all of them &mdash; think only about themselves, and making money.&quot;<br><b>Di Canio, very ironic statement many would argue (pot, kettle, black)<br></b><br>&quot;You   could take all the derby matches in the world and put them  together  and  they still wouldn&#39;t equal one-millionth of the Old Firm.

Born in 1968, Di Canio  grew up in a country that was violent and divided, as it had been since  Mussolini&#39;s rise to power. The 1945 liberation had failed to stimulate  the national unity that fascism had claimed it would build and a vicious  settling of scores left around 15,000 Italians dead in the three months  that followed. There were no trials, no coming to terms with the past  and, consequently, no definitive end to the ideological conflict in  Italian society.<br><br>After students revolted in 1968, northern  factory workers joined the fray in the &quot;hot autumn&quot; of 1969, car  industry operatives pitched battles with the forces of order on the  streets of Turin. Tacitly supported by the police, secret services and  more openly by conservative society, rightwing violence erupted in  response. The 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan left 16 dead and more  than 80 wounded. Hastily blamed on anarchists, it was eventually traced  to a neo-fascist group based in the Veneto region.<br><br>The  politicisation of the piazzas transferred to the terraces and, in the  midst of these tensions, Lazio won its first league title in 1974. Di  Canio was six, an age at which many of us imprint our first football  memories, and the team was full of &quot;Paolinos&quot;: mavericks, or fascists,  with passions for parachuting, militarism, violence and the neo-fascist  Italian Social Movement (MSI).<br>Guardian Today: the headlines, the analysis, the debate - sent direct to you<br>Read more<br><br>Hated  across the country for its political leanings, that Lazio team also  loved firearms. Holding up a Roman jewellery shop as a prank in 1977,  the midfielder Luciano Re Cecconi was shot dead. Rightwing and leftwing  terrorists were financing their political activities with armed  robberies, and Rome was understandably edgy.<br><br>Growing up in the  working-class district of Quarticciolo, Di Canio&#39;s allegiance would  logically have been to AS Roma. Instead, he chose to fight as the  underdog and, even as a member of Lazio&#39;s youth team he continued to run  with the Irriducibili ultras. For them, beyond the team itself,  loyalty, community and a romanticised glorification of the past are the  ties that bind. As an almost textbook fascist community, that past is  very much Roman.<br><br>The Roman past appealed to Mussolini too, who  assumed the title of Duce: the Latin word DUX, which translates as  &quot;leader&quot;, is tattooed on Di Canio&#39;s bicep. The Roman salute became a  part of daily life. Made compulsory prior to all sporting events, it was  this snarling gesture, during the Rome derby, that dogs Di Canio. &quot;An  ancient historical practice&quot; and &quot;different to the Nazi salute&quot; it might  be, but these are issues that he would have done well to explain ahead  of his first match as a Premier League manager on Sunday. He brought  them to the table after all.<br><br>But there is more to this than  simply football and Sunderland&#39;s risky survival strategy. There is the  fact that here in Italy there is a growing tide of support for many of  the ideas and thoughts that Di Canio espouses.<br><br>Mussolini  initially opposed ideas of Nordic racial purity, insisting that culture  was the main determining factor in race. But his scientists eventually  &quot;discovered&quot; that Italians were, in fact, Aryans of part-Nordic descent  which led in 1938 to racist policies officially being adopted. As such,  Italy&#39;s splintered neo-fascist parties do not always conform to British  concepts of neo-Nazism, such as the BNP, which seems to be what Di Canio  was driving at in previous explanations.<br><br>One such neo-fascist  group that has grown considerably in Rome since its formation in 2003 is  CasaPound. Describing itself as a social association, it criticises  Marxist and capitalist economics, promotes sports, popular culture and  has used Bobby Sands and Che Guevara among its eclectic campaign images.  While semi-respectable members do charitable works, its more maverick  elements like to meet and march.<br><br>And nowhere more so than in  Mussolini&#39;s birth and resting town, Emilia-Romagna. Rebuilt in honour of  the Duce, the annual &quot;March on Predappio&quot;, to celebrate his rise to  power, ensures fully-booked hotels, a brisk trade in the fascist  souvenir shops and a queue to sign the book of condolence in front of  the former leader&#39;s tomb.<br><br>Back in Lazio, last August the small  town of Affile unveiled a monument to Rodolfo Graziani, war criminal  indicted by the United Nations for atrocities committed in Abyssinia  (Ethiopia). It was paid for with &euro;130,000 (&pound;110,000) of Lazio regional  government money.<br><br><div>Di Canio&#39;s appointment may be a matter for  Sunderland, and Di Canio may be speaking the truth when he says that he  has no racist leanings. But the argument that fascism was nothing more  than &quot;National Socialism light&quot; or that Mussolini was a misunderstood  and principled individual who made some mistakes needs to be tackled  head-on. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div></div><br><br></div></div>
