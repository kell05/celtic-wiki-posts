He arrived back at Celtic Park at the start of the 1978-79 season to take charge of coaching the Reserves. He is reported to have had a good role in the development of  Charlie Nicholas, Pat Bonner, Halpin, and Peter Mackie.<br><br>Mark Reid said of him that he was &quot;<i>one of the best motivators of young players there is</i>&quot;.<br> <br> He was  asked to leave by manager Davie Hay after consultation with the Board on 2nd  February 1986, Hay apparently making the decision that Frank&#39;s role was  superfluous. <a href="/page/David+Hay%2C+1983+-+1987" target="_self">Davie Hay</a>, with the Board&#39;s approval sacked Frank  Connor who had been his assistant and first team coach since his  arrival. Hay felt that there was little coming from Frank&#39;s involvement  with the first team and from 2nd February 1986 Hay ran the first  team by himself. This presented a few problems. As Tom Campbell and Pat  Woods noted in &quot;<a href="/page/If+You+Know+The+History" target="_self"><i>Dreams, and Songs to Sing</i></a>&quot;, <a href="/page/McGrain%2C+Danny" target="_self">Danny McGrain</a> stated that a knee injury  prevented Hay from personally conducting and taking a full part in  training sessions. It therefore seems odd that Hay fired Frank Connor. <br>  <br> He went on to manage Raith Rovers, but moved to Hearts in  1990 to be Joe Jordan&#39;s first team coach/assistant manager (Joe Jordan was the then manager of Hearts). <br> <br> Frank was brought back to Celtic in the 1993/94 season by  Liam Brady as part of the package when Joe Jordan was recruited to Celtic as  Brady&#39;s Assistant Manager. He was again credited as being a great motivator  for young players, and in the difficult years of the early 1990&#39;s for Celtic, that was a  very important talent to have.<br>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>As  Caretaker Manager</h3><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-border2 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="600"><tbody><tr><td class="                        WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid2px WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid2px" width="100%">&quot;My philosophy was try and leave something a bit better than it was when you first arrived.&quot;<br><b>Frank Connor</b></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div><div><img align="right" alt="Connor, Frank - Kerrydale Street" height="400" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/WLeHfkkUMGI40DYYXd0CIg17349/GW277H400" title="Connor, Frank - Kerrydale Street" width="277"></div></div>    <br>It was during the days of the turmoil from all the efforts to &#39;Sack the Board&#39; (the <a href="/page/Celtic+Takeover" target="_self">Celtic Takeover</a> days), that Frank Connor was given a difficult lifeline. Following Liam Brady&#39;s departure as manager (and then his assistant manager Joe Jordan along with him), Frank Connor was given the impossible Caretaker manager position for a demoralised Celtic team. This was an opportunity that many Celtic men could only dream of, but in this case it really was in an unwanted environment.<br><br>Frank Connor was to be unceremoniously put in charge as the manager of the first team, which covered two league matches  (one victory, one draw) and a European tie first leg (won 1-0 v Sporting  Lisbon) in the interval between Liam Brady &amp; Joe Jordan&#39;s departure  and Lou Macari&#39;s appointment. <br><br>He then went on to manage the team to face  Rangers (in a 2-1 victory) three days after Macari&#39;s arrival. So Connor can  claim to have an unbeaten record in charge of the team. Unbeaten at  home, in Europe and against Rangers. We all dream of having as good a  record as Celtic manager (albeit for a longer stretch).<br><br> That brief summary is the standard you&#39;ll read on his time in various reports, but it very much understates his performance and achievement in the short time he was in  charge. The first team was a shambles and a bit of a laughing stock, and <a href="/page/Brady%2C+Liam" target="_self">Liam Brady</a>  had ended his time leaving behind a mess which few if anyone wanted to take over. <br><br>Frank Connor rallied the players together and  was the inspiration for a short spell which to everyone&#39;s surprise was to be a purple patch amongst all of the gloom of that era in the early 1990s. <br><br>In his short time he managed the First XI to be unbeaten domestically in the league, and (at the time unfathomable to our critics) he coached the First XI to win a game against good European opposition. This was a time when victories by the Celtic first team against European sides in the major competitions were very rare. <br><br>He actually had an instant impact in his interim role, with Celtic&#39;s 2-1 victory over Dundee in the league being incredibly Celtic&#39;s first league victory at home that season (9th Oct 1993), a further sign to just how poor Celtic were.<br><br>The game against Rangers  (Lou Macari&#39;s first as manager) was really Frank Connor&#39;s last as  caretaker manager, with Lou Macari allowing Frank Connor to dictate on the day. A wonderful victory against the Dark Side with a 2-1 win away was a  great way to cap off his short reign. There was some good football too. A well deserved mark for his  efforts, and he deserves greater recognition for what he helped achieve.<br> <br> The players are said to have wanted him to become the  new manager (many of whom knew him very well having worked under him with the junior and reserve sides), and Peter Grant expressed their faith in him wonderfully:<br><blockquote> <i>&quot;We would  say &#39;Give him the job now&#39;. We all regard him as the boss, and treat him  as such. He would make you play during the night for him. Frank has  kicked a few backsides around here and we will give our blood, sweat and  tears for him.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><i> <br> </i>However, he was likely not the right  choice for the full manager&#39;s job but better as a coach. He didn&#39;t have the management experience from another large club or a big name to assist him in case things were to change negatively. He took on his next role returning as assistant manager with no ails. As he later said: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;Deep down I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get the job. Sometimes I think &#39;what if?&#39; but I&#39;m not bitter about anything.&quot;  </i><br></blockquote><br>Despite that, many of  the fans who were there through that time will always wish him well for  the effort he put in during that difficult period of transition. Sadly, in time  things went back to normal and actually got worse under the next incumbent  (Lou Macari) who had begun to marginalise Frank Connor in preference for his own men, but Frank Connor&#39;s brief spell helped to put a smile back  on our faces for a wee while at least. The support will always respect him for  that.  <br><br>Frank Connor had served Celtic in four different capacities in four different eras, and always left his mark, serving the club to his fullest ability. For the that we couldn&#39;t have asked for more, and he will always be fondly remembered.<br><div align="center"> </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>    Quotes</h3><div>&quot;My philosophy was try and leave something a bit better than it was when you first arrived.&quot; </div><div><b>Frank Connor (2015)<br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div><br>&quot;We would say &#39;Give him the job now.&#39; We all  regard him as the boss, and treat him as such.

Mail<br><br>FRANK CONNOR restored the battered pride of Celtic&#39;s dressing-room back in 1993 - only to be overlooked when the Hoops named their new boss.<br><br>However, the 74-year-old insists he will always cherish his four weeks at the helm.<br><br>And the former Parkhead coach reckons interim gaffer Neil Lennon will feel exactly the same if he misses out on the top job.<br><br>Connor helped repair the damage of the Liam Brady era with an unbeaten run that included a 2-1 Old Firm win at Ibrox.<br><br>Lou Macari was in the dugout that day after being named gaffer but Connor picked the team and was credited with the victory.<br><br>Lennon has also been forced to pick up the pieces after Tony Mowbray&#39;s ill-fated reign.<br><br>And the players are backing the Irishman for the job after he won eight SPL games on the spin.<br><br>Connor knows how much it will hurt Lennon if Celtic opt for a more experienced manager.<br><br>But he&#39;s sure the 38-year-old would recover and look back on his brief spell as boss with pride.<br><br>Connor said: &quot;If Neil doesn&#39;t get the job it will spur him on. Being overlooked would give him fire in his belly to bounce back.<br><br>&quot;I was manager of Celtic for just four weeks but it was magnificent.<br><br>&quot;So, whatever happens, Neil can look back on his time in charge and cherish it forever.<br><br>&quot;If Neil doesn&#39;t get the job he might be a bit sore and that&#39;s only natural. But he can look back with pride on his time in charge - apart from the Ross County blip.<br><br>&quot;I took over at Celtic in similar circumstances. But I had been at Parkhead for a long time and had held a lot of positions.<br><br>&quot;Neil had to take the chance when it came to him. And if the club are going to go for a younger manager then he&#39;s entitled to the job.<br><br>&quot;He would need to get a good assistant who has been through the mill and still has the desire - like Craig Brown and Archie Knox at Motherwell.<br><br>&quot;Mowbray was relatively inexperienced and look at what happened to him. What people forget about the Old Firm is they are massive jobs.<br><br>&quot;Look at the players who were good elsewhere but failed at both clubs. They just couldn&#39;t handle it.<br><br>&quot;I can&#39;t understand the time it has taken Celtic to appoint a boss.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d love to tell you what I think they will do but they&#39;re impossible to second guess these days.&quot;<br><br>Connor isn&#39;t bitter at losing out to Macari for the Celtic job but does have one big regret.<br><br>He said: &quot;I didn&#39;t get the chance to manage the team in the UEFA Cup against Sporting Lisbon.<br><br>&quot;Lou was in charge by then and we lost 2-0 in Portugal to crash out 2-1 on aggregate.<br><br>&quot;I had enough experience to be manager of Celtic. I had been brought up under Jock Stein.<br><br>&quot;I had a good apprenticeship and knew what was right and wrong.<br><br>People have said I was too hard on myself and I suppose looking back I could have kept the job until the end of the season.<br><br>&quot;But Celtic needed a big name at the top. A massive club needs someone with charisma.<br><br>&quot;Tam McAdam was reserve coach at the time and joined me in taking the first team. We beat Dundee 2-1 in our first match but lost a goal early in that game.<br><br>&quot;I turned to Tam and said: &#39;I hope you&#39;re wearing a bullet-proof vest&#39;.<br><br>&quot;Deep down I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d ever get the job. Sometimes I think &#39;what if?&#39; but I&#39;m not bitter about anything.&quot;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><h3><img align="bottom" alt="Hay sacks Frank Connor" height="796" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Id60zEXUoV-hekNDcskoLw1182310/GW607H796" title="Hay sacks Frank Connor" width="607"></h3><br><h3>Frank Connor leaving to be manager of Berwick Rangers.</h3><img align="bottom" alt="Connor, Frank - Pic" height="392" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/NeH_M-BFDm7GJ-jY1u4LTg28420/GW640H392" title="Connor, Frank - Pic" width="640"><br><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>A frank Connor knows the score with Celtic</h3><br>http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12714744.A_frank_Connor_knows_the_score_with_Celtic/<br>22 Oct 1993<br><br>DESPITE an unbeaten record as Celtic&#39;s caretaker manager, 100% backing from the dressing room, and an unquestionable dedication to the club, Frank Connor insisted yesterday that the new man, presumably Lou Macari, will have every right to make his own judgment about staff, even if that means an exit for himself.<br><br>&#39;&#39;If I was going to a club, I would expect that myself,&#39;&#39; he said.<br><br>&#39;&#39;He will want to look at it closely and make up his own mind what he wants to do.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Connor has had no assurances from the Celtic board that his position, either as reserve team coach or any other role, is secure, and nor would he expect one.<br><br>&#39;&#39;Obviously, I want to be involved in the game at the highest level and would dearly love to be part of the Celtic set-up. But I am also realistic and I know what could happen.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Connor was asked to look after the side after first Liam Brady, and then Joe Jordan resigned. He has been in charge for three games, a win over Dundee -- the club&#39;s first league win of the season at Parkhead, a draw with premier division leaders Hibs at Easter Road, and a 1-0 victory over Sporting Lisbon in the UEFA Cup at home on Wednesday night.<br><br>It might all have happened anyway, but he is entitled to be given credit for engineering a decent hat trick in what cannot have been the easiest of circumstances, with constant speculation about the next manager, and boardroom power struggles.<br><br>The fact that he has been a long time in the business has been a vital asset in Connor&#39;s situation. He had two spells as a player at Parkhead and this is his second stint in the management department -- he was assistant to David Hay. Connor said that he had been encouraged by the board to keep working as he has always done and when the time comes, they will speak to him.<br><br>In the end his future will depend on Macari, who began talks with Celtic yesterday, but who may not be installed for a few days yet.<br><br>Connor does not know the former Celtic man well, but pointed out that that did not hinder Jock Wallace and Joe Jordan appointing him as their assistants with Motherwell and Hearts respectively.<br><br>&#39;&#39;I don&#39;t really want to talk in depth about my position,&#39;&#39; said Connor. &#39;&#39;I have managed up to now to stay involved in the game and I&#39;d like to think I will carry on that way.<br><br>&#39;&#39;You do what you&#39;ve got to do and people judge you. I will take it from there.&#39;&#39;<br><br>Rangers&#39; leader Walter Smith enjoyed a couple of bonuses of his own this week with the return to action of John Brown after lengthy injury and the continuing progress towards match fitness of striker Ally McCoist. Brown will not be a starter for the League Cup final against Hibs on Sunday at Parkhead, but McCoist will be very much a key figure.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><img align="bottom" alt="Board, Management & Player Changes. - The Celtic Wiki" height="966" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d23b6571b6d345dae7342b46da25bca9/GW746H966" title="Board, Management & Player Changes. - The Celtic Wiki" width="746"><br><br><br><br></h3><h3>  Frank Connor latest name to be added to Raith Hall of Fame</h3>Paul McCabePublished: 08:40 Thursday 11 June 2015<br>https://www.fifetoday.co.uk/sport/football/raith-rovers/frank-connor-latest-name-to-be-added-to-raith-hall-of-fame-1-3798595Former Raith Rovers boss Frank Connor is to be inducted into the club&rsquo;s Hall of Fame this year.<br>He is the second name selected by the public vote after David McGurn, and will also be joined by the committee&rsquo;s first pick, Joe Baker.Frank Connor with Tom Houston at the first Raith Hall of Fame event in 2012.<br>Speaking to the Press the 79-year-old said to be nominated by the Raith Rovers support was &ldquo;something special&rdquo;.<br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I loved every minute of my time at Raith Rovers and I had a great camaraderie with the supporters.&rdquo;<br>Connor took over the hot seat at Stark&rsquo;s Park in 1986 having been sacked as assistant manager to Davie Hay at Celtic.<br>&ldquo;I was on a low after Celtic and I was ready for Raith Rovers.<br> My philosophy was try and leave something a bit better than it was when you first arrived Frank Connor<br>&ldquo;I remember when I went in for the interview.<br>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;ve been up at the top like I had you want to get back there so I looked them in the eye in the boardroom and said I don&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;m going to get there but I&rsquo;m going back to the Premier league if you want to come with me, I&rsquo;m your man!&rdquo;<br>Connor didn&rsquo;t quite make it to the Premier League with Rovers but set the foundations for the latter successful years under Jimmy Nicholl, who he signed as a player.<br>&ldquo;My philosophy was try and leave something a bit better than it was when you first arrived.<br>&ldquo;When I came to Rovers they were in the second division but I got lucky, we brought in some great experienced guys like Hamish McAlpine, big Bobby Glennie and Cammy Fraser who was different class.<br>&lsquo;They worked well with the young local guys at the club.<br>&ldquo;I enjoyed my time at Kirkcaldy every bit as much as I did at Celtic.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br>Frank can&rsquo;t wait for Hall of Fame<br>Frank Connor said the Hall of Fame night will be an emotional experience for himself and his family.<br>&ldquo;Never in a million years would I have imagined that I&rsquo;d be inducted,&rdquo; he said.<br>&ldquo;I was just doing my job to the best of my ability.

The other is Frank Connor.<br><br>Connor&rsquo;s playing career at Celtic is not so well known. He played eight games in the 1961-1962 season before being handed a free transfer at the end of that campaign and it&rsquo;s rather surprising to note that he stood five foot and eight inches, which is regarded as being a bit on the small side for a goalkeeper. This was a turbulent period in Celtic&rsquo;s history and there was a high turnover of players at that time.<br><br>When John Clark left his role as Celtic&rsquo;s reserve team manager in 1977 to become Billy McNeill&rsquo;s assistant at Aberdeen, Frank Connor was Jock Stein&rsquo;s surprise choice as the new reserve manager. He was to be highly regarded by all at Celtic Park for the three years that he performed in that role. Very much a Celtic man, Frank instilled in the hopeful youngsters the pride that every Celtic player should have in wearing that renowned green and white jersey. He was also said to be good when dealing with the first team players who may have been out of form or returning from injury and who may have been looking to have their confidence boosted.<br><br>As with most things it took Frank a while to stamp his own authority on his young charges. There was one particularly bad result in 1978 when Celtic lost 7-0 at Ibrox although in fairness it has to be said that Rangers played a hugely experienced team in comparison to Celtic&rsquo;s young eleven. However, by 1979 things began to take shape and Frank had formed a terrific young side which played the traditional Celtic way of attacking football. The young Celts won the reserve double of league and cup in 1980, which was a notable achievement given the wealth of young talent on display within Scottish football at that time. From memory, the cup was a two legged affair and after losing 5-1 at Love Street the young Celts roared back to win 5-0 against St Mirren at Parkhead. A couple of drubbings were also dished out to Rangers as retribution for the heavy Ibrox defeat in 1978.<br><br>The reserves showed their success was no fluke by winning another double the next season. However, the main priority of any reserve side is not to win trophies but to develop young players for first team action and Frank was able to provide Billy McNeill with an array of young talent. In the early 1980&rsquo;s Frank helped to develop three particular young talents who were amongst the best in British football in their respective positions for the next decade &ndash; Charlie Nicholas, Pat Bonner and Paul McStay. There were others who made significant contributions to the Celtic cause such as Mark Reid, Willie McStay, Danny Crainie and Davie Moyes. And others again who moved on to have fine careers in the game like Jim Duffy, Peter Mackie, Jim McInally, John Weir and John Halpin. The side which Frank put together were unbeaten in reserve league football for almost two years, a highly notable achievement at that level.<br><br>Every one of those boys was to speak highly of Frank Connor in later years and pay tribute to how he developed them not only as footballers but also as men. By all accounts, Frank was a motivator who put his side on the field fired up and proud to be playing in those famous green and white hoops but also a man who insisted that the boys enjoy their football and be appreciative of the highly fortunate position they found themselves in as professional footballers.<br><br>Frank&rsquo;s success did not go unnoticed and there was much sadness when he left his reserve role in late 1980 to become manager at Berwick Rangers. It was rather ironic that Celtic drew Berwick in the Scottish Cup a matter of weeks later at Shielfield Park with a young Charlie Nicholas putting his old mentor&rsquo;s side to the sword.<br><br>By 1983 Frank Connor was assistant manager to Jock Wallace at Motherwell. The Fir Park club had spent big to lure Wallace back north from his spell as Leicester City manager and he had done reasonably well in his first season. Over at Parkhead, Billy McNeill had departed for Manchester City in highly acrimonious circumstances and as Celtic contemplated the manager&rsquo;s position, Chairman Desmond White announced Frank as Celtic&rsquo;s new assistant manager before the actual manager had even been appointed. Davie Hay was named as manager within a few days but it was clear that Frank was not Davie&rsquo;s choice and it was regarded as a strange for a new manager not to choose his own backroom staff. It was to Wallace&rsquo;s great credit that, well knowing Frank&rsquo;s allegiances to Celtic, that he did not stand in the way of his move to Parkhead.<br><br>Initially things went reasonably well under very difficult circumstances. Aberdeen and Dundee United were in their pomp under Alex Ferguson and Jim McLean, with Rangers very much on the margins. After a trophy less first season, Celtic won the Scottish Cup in memorable fashion against Dundee United and the Celts then looked to carry that forward into the next season.<br><br>In February 1986 Celtic were in contention for the league title and had enjoyed a fine 3-1 win at Dens Park on a day when they could even afford the luxury of a missed Paul McStay penalty. Immediately after this game Davie Hay dismissed Frank from his assistant&rsquo;s role citing footballing differences as the reason. This was a huge shock to everyone connected with the club as there had been no rumours of any unrest behind the scenes. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that Hay then went it alone until the end of the season without appointing a replacement.<br><br>Many may have thought that that was the end of the line between Frank Connor and Celtic but he was to return to Parkhead in yet another capacity in 1993. Liam Brady was struggling as Celtic manager and his last throw of the dice was to change his coaching staff with Joe Jordan coming in as assistant manager and Connor as first team coach. Sadly for Brady, things did not improve and he resigned in October 1993 after a dismal defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. Jordan also resigned shortly after and the Celtic directors appointed Connor as interim manager whilst they attempted to procure a new manager.<br><br>Frank&rsquo;s first game in charge was against Dundee at Parkhead on a day of horrid weather. It all looked too predictable when Dundee took the lead however Celtic fought back to win 2-1. The most encouraging thing about the victory that day had been the fighting spirit which had been so absent during Brady&rsquo;s time and had been missing at Parkhead for some time.<br><br>A 1-1 draw at Easter Road was followed by a 1-0 first leg win over an impressive Sporting Lisbon side in the UEFA cup. The Portuguese side looked a class act that night, although Frank was able to boast that he had tactically got one over Sporting&rsquo;s manager, the great Bobby Robson.<br><br>Lou Macari was then appointed as Celtic&rsquo;s new manager in a fanfare of publicity approaching the Ibrox contest between Celtic and Rangers in late October. Macari publicly admitted that he knew very little of the Celtic players and asked Frank Connor to pick the team on view of this. Celtic were huge under dogs before the match but the old fighting spirit was again in evidence as they fought back from 0-1 down to win 2-1 courtesy of a dramatic injury time winner from Brian O&rsquo;Neil. Thus, Frank&rsquo;s short tenure as Celtic manager had resulted in an impressive three wins and a draw.<br><br>Macari was the old Celtic board&rsquo;s last gamble and it was not to pay off. By May 1994 he would be unceremoniously shown the exit door by new Celtic owner, Fergus McCann. It&rsquo;s easy to be wise with hindsight but the feeling is that the board should have kept Frank as manager even until the end of the season. The fans had faith in him and the players publicly stated that he commanded their respect so Celtic would not have much to lose. As it was Frank was marginalised by Macari who brought his own coaching staff from Stoke City and by the end of that season Frank had left Celtic once more.<br><br><div>Frank Connor&rsquo;s name may not be as illustrious as some in Celtic&rsquo;s history but in four different roles and in four different decades he served Celtic magnificently.
