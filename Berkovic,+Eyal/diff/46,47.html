The capture of the Israeli star was meant to signal an exciting new era for the Hoops under new management &#39;Dream Team&#39; of coach <a href="/page/Barnes%2C+John" target="_self">John Barnes</a> and Director of Football, Kenny Dalglish. In Israel he had the nickname of <span class="diffRemove">&quot;The</span><span class="diffAdd">&quot;</span><i><span class="diffAdd">The</span><span class="diffFormatting" title="Formatting Changed: Italic"> </span><span class="diffRemove">Magician&quot;!</span><span class="diffAdd">Magician</span></i><span class="diffAdd">&quot;!</span> The nicknames he was to gather away from Israel in Scotland (and England) were to be less polite and far more colourful. <br><br>Berkovic had impressed enough in highlights during his spell in England with Southampton and the Hammers to have most Celtic fans wetting their lips in anticipation of the season ahead. But despite showing fleeting glimpses of his talent the little midfielder failed to settle into a Celtic side which struggled badly in the league after the loss of talisman Henrik Larsson to an horrific leg break in Lyon on October 21. However much of that was down to lack of efforts on his part.<br><br>As 1999 drew to a close Berkovic strung together some excellent performances to inspire Celtic to an unbeaten run which gave the fans renewed hope for the new Millennium. That hope was soon dashed as Celtic and Berkovic emerged from the mid-winter shutdown looking decidedly off key. Rumours were rife that Berkovic was a troublemaker and that the Celtic dressing room was far from a happy place. <br><br>Just how unhappy was made painfully clear on Tuesday February 8th 2000 when a pathetic Celtic were humiliated in front of the Club&#39;s fans at Celtic Park by First Division Inverness Caledonian Thistle in the Scottish Cup third round. The 3-1 defeat to the Highlanders was the final straw for Celtic fans who had by this time witnessed one too many spineless displays from Berkovic and some of his equally lavishly paid team-mates. He was said to be in the thick of it, in what was to be a highly tense half-time barracking in the changing rooms.<br><br>While that match signalled the end for John Barnes, Berkovic would stick around a little while longer. He continued to tease the fans with moments of magic. His performance against Kilmarnock in the April of that season was simply scintillating as he ran the Ayrshire side ragged as Celtic recorded a 4-2 victory. Even then he spoiled matters by making unwarranted &amp; undignified gestures to a Hoops support which with some justification had previously demanded more effort from their big money signing. Even post-match he refused to apologise which exacerbated matters, or as he ridiculously &amp; unconvincingly put it:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;I believe my celebrations were misinterpreted but I can assure our fans that my actions were a way of expressing my excitement.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>Despite some brief cameos of genius, they could not disguise Berkovic&#39;s generally infuriating lack of heart/effort and petulant behaviour, and when Martin O&#39;Neill was appointed as Celtic manager in June 2000 everyone knew time would soon be up for the immature Berkovic. Didn&#39;t exactly help when he started selling some sanctimonious stories to the press on his time at Celtic.<br><br>O&#39;Neill used the Israeli sparingly and by the start of 2001 he was barely on the fringes of the Celtic first team. In February - a year after the Caley debacle - Berkovic headed to Blackburn on loan and most Celtic fans would have happily paid the taxi fare to take him to Lancashire. He eventually left for good in the summer of 2001, joining Manchester City for &pound;1.75 million. By then he had made 38 appearances for the Hoops, scoring 8 goals. <br><br>There can be few Celtic players who had promised so much, only to deliver so little, and then for all to wish he was to be booted out.<br><br>Sad fact is that the above summary has had to concentrate on matters heavily away from the matches. Despite the negatives, there were some positives too. Some fine performances displayed the undoubted talent he had, and his two goals in the 4-2 defeat v Rangers showed that when he was up for it, he had the determination and dig to succeed. He had the chutzpah to dazzle, but also frustrate, which was to be as much a strength as a weakness. At Celtic, he had become too much for anyone to handle, and actually it was the same everywhere he went.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br>It wasn&#39;t just at Celtic where he went on to become a persona non grata. At West Ham (prior to joining Celtic) he had been involved in an infamous spat with later Celtic playing great John Hartson, who booted Berkovic in the mouth.Some wish he&#39;d hit him harder. Berkovic&#39;s autobiography &quot;<i>Ha-Kosem&quot;</i> sparked controversy within the Israeli football scene because of the sharp one-sided and blunt/crude criticism of many of its figures. In 2006, he left a club he played for in Israel due to &quot;<i>poor professional relations</i>&quot; (says it all).<br><br>He once had a spat with his club manager at Man City (Kevin Keegan) which developed into a very public falling out (not too dissimilar to the situation at Celtic), and the following comment from him clearly shows his then odious mentality:<br><blockquote>&quot;<i>I don&#39;t see any reason why Kevin didn&#39;t play me because I was the best player in training for six months and everyone knew that. Man City&#39;s 45,000 supporters knew I had to play but Kevin was behaving like a big baby. I told him that and I think he deserves the sack</i>.&quot;<br></blockquote><br>Berkovic&rsquo;s appetite for    confrontation continued even after football. He was found    guilty of assaulting the coach of his son&rsquo;s schoolboy team, after his    son was substituted in a game in 2007. Berkovic had screamed at the referee:<i> &quot;I&#39;ll screw you, I&#39;ll see you are finished. I&#39;ll come after you for the rest of your career.&quot;</i> You couldn&#39;t make it up, could  you? He unconvincingly explained his outburst by saying: &quot;<i>Etzioni [the coach] humiliated my son so I humiliated Etzioni!</i>&quot;. <br><br>If he had any intelligence or at least some common sense he&#39;d probably have seen that there was one common denominator causing the problems in all this (i.e. himself), but some would argue that it likely just passed him by and he would remain unlikeable more than anything else.<br><br>However, after some time since leaving Celtic and retiring from football first team action, he actually has seemed to have more respect for Celtic than when he was here (let&#39;s hope it&#39;s the same for other clubs too). To fellow prospect <a href="/page/Kayal%2C+Beram" target="_self">Beram Kayal</a> he gave a good report on the club which helped to foster his transfer to Celtic. So for that at least the Celtic support respect him (just hope he can sort himself out now as well).<br>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Playing Career   </h3>  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="WPC-edit-style-list7 WPC-edit-border-none WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="827">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid" width="90">  <font color="#000000" size="2"><b>Club</b></font></td>  <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" width="71">  <font color="#000000" size="2"><b>From</b></font></td>   <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" width="71">  <font color="#000000" size="2"><b>To</b></font></td>  <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" width="83">  <font color="#000000" size="2"><b>Fee</b></font></td>   <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" colspan="2" width="128">  <font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">League</font></b></font></td>  <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" colspan="2" width="128"><font size="2"><b>Scottish<font color="#000000"> Cup</font></b></font></td>  <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" colspan="2" width="128">  <font size="2"><b><font color="#000000">League cup</font></b></font></td>  <td class="xl24 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px" colspan="2" width="128">  <b><font color="#000000" size="2">Other</font></b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td class="xl28 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid" width="90">  <font color="#000000" size="2">Blackburn</font></td>  <td align="right" class="xl25 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="71">  <font color="#000000" size="2">06/02/2001</font></td>   <td align="right" class="xl25 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="71">  <font color="#000000" size="2">08/05/2001</font></td>  <td class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="83">  <font color="#000000" size="2">Loan  </font></td>  <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>  <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>  <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>  <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>   <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>   <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>   <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px" width="64"><br></td>   <td align="right" class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderTop-solid2px WPC-edit-borderRight-solid" width="64"><br></td></tr>   <tr>  <td class="xl28 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor WPC-edit-borderLeft-solid" width="90">  <font color="#000000" size="2">Celtic</font></td>  <td align="right" class="xl25 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="71">  <font color="#000000" size="2">08/07/1999</font></td>  <td align="right" class="xl25 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="71">  <font color="#000000" size="2">21/07/2001</font></td>  <td class="xl26 WPC-edit-custom-bgColor" width="83">  <font color="#000000" size="2">&pound;

Zahavi said: &quot;Eyal made the biggest mistake of his life when he praised Rangers after signing for Celtic. That soured his future with the club, especially with the fans.<br><br>&quot;Eyal is not a politician and did not understand the delicate relationship of the Old Firm. What did he say that was so bad? Nothing.&quot;All he said was Rangers were a very good team, which they were as they were the dominant force in Scotland.<br><br>&quot;But Eyal has no regrets. It was a great move for him at the time but he became a victim of what happened to Barnes and Dalglish.<br><br>&quot;He was a product of their era and suffered a lot because of it. Then Martin O&#39;Neill came in and he was not accepted. He quickly realised there was no chance he would play regularly.<br><br>&quot;And Eyal felt the fans were easily influenced by the Press and that&#39;s one of the main reasons why they turned against him.&quot;<br><br>The former Southampton star - who had been trying to leave the club for more than a year - earned a reputation for being a lazy whinger and a bad influence in the dressing room.<br><br>A move to Blackburn fell through at the end of last season.
