The &quot;gate&rdquo; was a record one, it being calculated that 40,000 spectators were present and the money value of the attendance was officially stated to exceed &pound;1450. So great was the rush, that although the gate were closed nearly an hour before the start, the spectators encroached on the touch line and as a result of protests lodged by both teams for this reason, the Association have ordered the tie to be replayed on April 9. The wintry weather caused the postponement of a great many Rugby matches.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Teams</h3><b>Celtic:-</b> <br><a href="/page/Cullen%2C+Joseph" target="_self">Cullen</a>, <a href="/page/Reynolds%2C+Jeremiah" target="_self">Reynolds</a>, <a href="/page/Doyle%2C+Daniel" target="_self">Doyle</a>, <a href="/page/Maley%2C+Willie" target="_self">W Maley</a>, <a href="/page/Kelly%2C+James" target="_self">Kelly</a> (Captain), <a href="/page/Dowds%2C+Peter" target="_self">Dowds</a>, <a href="/page/McCallum%2C+Neil" target="_self">McCallum</a>, <a href="/page/Brady%2C+Alec" target="_self">Brady</a>, <a href="/page/Madden%2C+Johnny" target="_self">Madden</a>, <a href="/page/Campbell%2C+Johnny" target="_self">Campbell</a>, <a href="/page/McMahon%2C+Sandy" target="_self">McMahon</a>.<br><b>Goal:-</b> Campbell 60.<br><br><b>Queens Park:-</b> <br>Baird, Sillars, Smellie (Captain), Gillespie, Robertson, Stewart, Gulliland, Waddell, J Hamilton, Sellar, Lambie.<br><br><b>Att:-</b> 40,000.<br><b>Ref:-</b> Mr Sneddon, Edinburgh University, (President of the SFA).<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><ul><li>Match Report (See Below)</li><li><a class="external" href="http://www.celticfc.net/home/fixturesResults/ViewMatch.aspx?matchid=1892-03-12_que&season=1891" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Official Site</a></li></ul><h3>Pictures</h3><ul><li>Match Pictures</li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Match Reports</h3><h3>From newspaper reports from the time.</h3><br><h3>Report 1</h3><br>QUEEN&#39;S PARK v CELTIC. <br>FINAL TIE SCOTTISH CUP. <br><br><font face="Arial" size="3">Without parallel in the history of football was the interest excited over this year&rsquo;s Scottish Cup Final, which was regarded as in some sense a trial of strength between the principal League club and the leading club outside that body. Looking to the large following which both the Celtic and Queen&#39;s Park- the finalists on this occasion &ndash; command, as well as the interest taken in the fixture by football followers generally; it was confidently felt that the attendance would constitute a record for Scotland, If not also for Great Britain, the record previous to Saturday having been established in England under the Rugby code. Bearing this in mind, the most elaborate arrangements had been made by the Executive of the Rangers&rsquo; Club, on whose ground the match was played, for the accommodation of a vast crowd. Extensive stands had been erected all round the ground, the sides and the corners of the field of play had been banked up so that all could obtain a view of the game, and additional entrances had been provided. As early as twelve o&#39;clock&mdash; four hours before the time advertised for the start of the game &ndash; the gates of Ibrox Park were thrown open for the admission of the public, and even at that early hour dozens put in an appearance at the ground.<br>From one o&#39;clock the crowd poured in in hundreds and when half-past two o&#39;clock arrived the spacious ground seemed packed to its utmost capacity. Thousands, however, still continued to pour in, and as a consequence, the only thing to be expected took place&mdash;the crowd in front were forced over the barricade on to track, and having got thus far, a regular stampede took place from the entrance gates right over the field of play, till on both sides of the ground the spectators encroached on the touch line. During the stampede, the crowd made a vigorous attack on the old stand on the north side of the ground which was already tightly packed, but the occupants succeeded in beating them off. The police arrangements were totally inadequate to stem the rush, and it was not till some mounted police arrived on the ground that the crowd was cleared back so as to be clear of the touch line.<br>At ten minutes past three it was found necessary to close the gates, and large numbers tried ineffectually to gain admission. Before the game started the attendance was calculated to number close upon 40,000, representing over &pound;1450, and the scene which then presented itself was one never to be forgotten. Every few minutes the rush on the part of the enthusiastic followers of the game was renewed, and in view of the increased excitement which would ensue when the game was started, it was felt that the match would not be allowed to proceed as a cup tie. This turned out to be correct, as several times the game had to be stopped, and by mutual agreement the teams at length decided that the match would not rank as a cup tie, and a protest was accordingly lodged by each with the referee, Mr Sneddon, President of the Association.<br>Early in the second period the spectators seemed to have become aware of this fact, and a good deal of interest died out of the game, which might possibly account for the absence of that excitement at the finish which has, on many previous occasions, characterised the termination of a Scottish final. Prior to the match, opinion ruled about equal as to which team would secure the much-coveted honour, but a powerful factor in favour of the Queen&rsquo;s Park was the fact that they had figured in nine of the eighteen previous finals, and in none of these had been beaten, while their opponents, founded in 1888, had only once previously &ndash; the first year of their existence &ndash; passed through the ordeal of a final, and on that occasion were beaten by the Third Lanark. It was therefore a surprise to many that the Celts managed to emerge from the contest victorious by a goal to nothing, especially under the peculiarly exciting circumstances under which the match was played.<br>The Association, as was confidently expected, at a meeting on Saturday evening, sustained the protests lodged, and in view of the international engagements, deferred the replaying of the tie till the 9th April. The same ground was chosen as the venue, but the charge for admission to 2s., which the view of having the crowd of manageable dimensions. The game was started sharp to time, the only change in the teams being Arnott&rsquo;s absence from the ranks of the Hampden Park eleven. Kelly having lost the toss, the Celts kicked off. It was soon apparent that the softness of the ground would to some extent affect the play, and the Celtic at the start seemed to be most handicapped on this score, as the Queen&rsquo;s had all the best of the opening stages of the game. Before two minutes had elapsed Cullen was compelled to handle the ball, and hardly had the pressure been relieved than the Queen&rsquo;s again bore down on him. Sellars had an open goal before him, but to the chagrin of the Queen&rsquo;s followers he shot wildly, and the effort went for nothing.<br>Rousing themselves, the Celts made a raid on their opponents goal, but Smellie averted the danger, and the ball being then well taken up by Hamilton, the Irishmen had once more to defend their lines. Doyle was passed by the Queen&rsquo;s centre, but Reynolds gave his team relief. So far as the game had proceeded the Queen&rsquo;s had easily held the upper hand, and they seemed at length likely to score, but Gulliland was at the critical moment charged down by Reynolds. A free kick was awarded by Mr Sneddon, but nothing came from it. Not long afterwards the Queen&rsquo;s were again bombarding the Celtic citadel, and a shot from Hamilton again caused Cullen to use his hands.<br>After a little pressure by the Queen&rsquo;s the game had to be stopped for a few minutes by reason of the encroachment of the crowd on the Celtic goal, but after the mounted police has been requisitioned the game was resumed. Soon after the resumption the Celtic goal had two very narrow escapes, and this apparently had the effect of rousing the Irishmen to show their real merits, for they immediately came down the field in beautiful style, Campbell leading a splendid dribble. Though Sellars kicked into touch, Kelly got the ball when it was thrown out, and put in a high dropping shot which many thought had taken effect, but it went just over the bar.<br>The Celtic now did a period of pressing, but it did not last long, as once more the Queen&rsquo;s got down the field, and Stewart all but landed a goal by a fine effort from near midfield, which was followed by an attempt on the part of Waddell, which Cullen also, however, succeeded in keeping out. For the next ten minutes play was of a fluctuating nature, McMahon almost on one occasion scoring for the Celts, while Hamilton, with a fine opportunity for scoring sent in an erratic shot for the Queen&rsquo;s. It was only at this point that the Celts began to show their true form, and having now got quite into the spirit of the game, they fairly held their own with the Queen&rsquo;s, Campbell on one occasion losing a certain goal for them by heading outside of the posts.<br>Half-time arrived, however, without any scoring. In the second half, the Celts showed surprising form when compared with that with which they opened the game. In the early stage of the second half the Queen&rsquo;s backs had all their work cut out to keep the Irishmen in check, but after a period of hard pressure they managed to raise the siege in beautiful style, and passing the ball on to their forwards, the latter took it right to the Celtic goal line. Sellar was entrusted with the parting kick, but sent the ball wide.<br>The Celts again assuming the aggressive, Madden tried Baird with a splendid shot, which the latter fell in saving, Campbell, however, completed the effort in putting the ball through for the Celts, the point being the signal for an extraordinary outburst of enthusiasm. Just as the game was restarted, the Queen&rsquo;s dashed off in brilliant fashion, and Hamilton sent through a beautiful shot, but to the disappointment of the supporters of the Hampden Park team, the whistle had previously blown. From this point the Celtic continued to show up in brilliant style, Doyle coming in for numerous ovations for his grand play at back. The Queen&rsquo;s had, however, a lot of life and plenty of pluck still left in them, and they occasionally made some very dashing breaks away, but their efforts met with no better success that in the first half.<br>As time drew near, however, the Queen&rsquo;s had distinctly the best of the game, but the strong defence of the Celtic neutralised all their efforts. Again before the close, the game had to be stopped on account of the encroachment of the crowd. In the last minute or two of the game the Celtic made another raid on their opponent&rsquo;s lines, but without result, and a memorable game terminated with the Celtic leading by one goal to nil. It may be said that the arrangements for the reporters, who hailed from all parts of the country, were of the most insufficient kind.</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Report 2</h3>The final tie for the Scottish Cup, played in the Rangers&#39; ground at Ibrox, will long be remembered in the annals of the game for the enthusiasm it aroused. Since it became known a fortnight ago that the clubs were destined to meet in the final, nothing else had been talked about in Association circles.<br><br>The attendance far exceeded the most sanguine anticipations, it being estimated that close upon 40,000 persons were inside the park. the Rangers&#39; committee had made special preparations by the erection of two new stands and additional terracing, and altogether it was believed that 36,000 could be accommodated comfortably.<br><br>the scene on the way to the field will long be remembered. In fact, there was never anything approaching it in the history of the game. As early as noon, four hours before kick-off, people began to wend their way to the field, and by two o&#39;clock the ground was nearly packed. No fewer than 13 special and several ordinary trains carrying a;most 12,000 passengers, arrived at Ibrox, and it is gratifying to state that under the management of Mr McWhirter, the stationmaster, and a staff of assistants, there was no mishap.<br><br>By three o&#39;clock the pressure at the gates had become so great that it was resolved to close them, but before this was done thousands managed to get free entrance. The ground was in charge of Captain Hamilton, who had over a hundred constables present, besides four officers on horseback.<br><br>The crowd was a good-natured one, and during the interval sang snatches of popular airs. An hour before the start the pressure had become so great that there was a general break into the field of play, but by strenuous efforts the police managed to restore something like order.<br><br>There was general disappointment when it became known that the premier club were without their famous back Walter Arnott, who had received an injury to his foot, and in the circumstances it was resolved to play Sillars in Arnott&#39;s place and Gillespie of the second eleven in Sillar&#39;s. The Celts were out in full force.<br><br>Unfortunately the ground, being soft and slippery, was all against a first-class display, and as it turned out the players could not keep their feet.<br><br>The Queen&#39;s led off with great dash, and had hard lines in not scoring right off. As the game proceeded the excitement became intense, and the crowd breaking over the touch-line a consultation was held, and it was agreed that the game should only be a friendly one. This was the wisest course in the circumstances. the decision, however, did not affect the play, for the game was fast throughout.<br><br>At half-time neither side had scored, but early in the second period the Celts succeeded, the result of a determined attack on the Queen&#39;s citadel. The shouting of the Irishmen had hardly died away when the Queen&#39;s equalised, but, unfortunately, the whistle had been blown previously for offside, and the point was disallowed.<br><br>From this stage till the close the game was most determinedly contested. The Queen&#39;s tried hard to equalise, but the Celts maintained grand defensive tactics, and managed to win by one goal to nil. Generally speaking, the Queen&#39;s had most of the play, their half-backs, and Robertson in particular, upsetting the combination of the the Celts.<br><br>So far as can be ascertained the drawings amounted to &pound;1900 in round numbers, &pound;1400 at the gates and &pound;500 at the stands. the gate money is divided equally among the clubs and the Association, and the rangers take the stand-money.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>Report 3 - Glasgow Herald March 14th 1892<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="1892 SC Final Glashow Herald" height="828" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/b6273aa6039efa8014abfb37c08d7544/GW406H828" title="1892 SC Final Glashow Herald" width="406"><img align="bottom" alt="1892 SC Final Glasgow Herald" height="828" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/155e6b0359b9d8e2ce34f166b660c304/GW408H828" title="1892 SC Final Glasgow Herald" width="408"><img align="bottom" alt="1892 SC Final Glasgow Herald 3" height="154" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/57f49df8a4b9e530651f7443dcb85cea/GW408H154" title="1892 SC Final Glasgow Herald 3" width="408"><img align="bottom" alt="1892 SC Final Glasgow Herald" height="154" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/57f49df8a4b9e530651f7443dcb85cea/GW408H154" title="1892 SC Final Glasgow Herald" width="408"><br><br>Before a record crowd, estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000 persons, the final tie for the Scottish Cup was played on Rangers&#39; ground at Ibrox Park. the ground was very soft and all against a first-class display. Arnott was absent from the Queen&#39;s team and Sillars tookk his place, while Gillespie of the second eleven filled Sillars&#39; place.<br><br>The Celtic were first to appear, led by Kelly, and received a great ovation, as did the Queen&#39;s, led by Smellie, shortly afterwards. Punctual to time, Madden kicked off for the Celts, the Queen&#39;s having won the toss. The Queen&#39;s were first to cross the line, but the Celts soon broke away, only, however, to be repulsed. Sellar had a capital run, and the ball being passed to the right it looked dangerous for the celts. In fact, amidst the greatest excitement, Sellar just missed sending the ball through from a pass by Hamilton.<br><br>It was a narrow affair. Gradually working their way down, Campbell crossed to McCallum, who screwed the ball in, but Smellie&#39;s leg came in the way and saved. the Celts were asserting their superiority, and the left wing was puting in some beautiful work.<br><br>For the Queen&#39;s hamilton had a clear run, but Reynolds came to the rescue and saved. The ground was very slippery, and falls were frequent. Still, the Queen&#39;s managed to make headway, and Gulliland tried a long shot, which went widwe of the mark. The popular QP right-winger was afterwards charged badly, and a foul was given, but it came to nothing.<br><br>The Queen&#39;s were fairly in it, and Hamilton shot for goal, but missed. Tom Robertson headed a grand run for the Queen&#39;s, and after some passing in front of goal the premier club&#39;s forwards nearly got the ball through.<br><br>The Celts were fairly hemmed in for a time, but gradually they got away, and McMahon was shaping for goal when he was grassed. Some beautiful passing by all the Queen&#39;s forwards was loudly cheered, but Sellar, who was entrusted with the final effort, shot wide of the mark. The Celtic forwards once more assumed offensive tactics, but with Madden right in front of goal, Robertson stepped in and coolly took the ball away.<br><br>The defence of the Queen&#39;s was really very fine, and their forward play at this stage certainly deserved a point. Had Sellar been in a good position, and accepted a pass from Waddell, he would undoubtedly have scored.<br><br>the game had to be stopped for a minute or two owing to the crowd breaking in, and there seemed some probability that it would not proceed. After consultation a start was made.<br><br>The Celts at once took the ball to the other end, but Smellie returned, and Waddell sent in a fine shot, saved at the expense of a corner, Cullen sending the ball over the bar. Sellar took the kick, and the ball landed among the QP forwards, when Hamilton, who had been playing far above the average, shot wide of the mark. the Celts got off once more, but Donald Sillars met them with fine defensive tactics.<br><br>After 25 minutes&#39; play Kelly sent in a high shot, which some people though had gone through, but it dropped over the bar. Dan Doyle, with a huge kick, relieved a dangerous looking run by Gulliland and Waddell.<br><br>A foul right in front of the Celts&#39; goal gave great anxiety to their supporters, but once more the Celts relieved, only, however, to be forced back, when Stewart, from long range, sent in a swift high shot, which very nearly took effect. Waddell tested Cullen with a quick long shot, but the young Celtic custodian was not found wanting, and managed to get the ball away.<br><br>The play became fast and exciting, but the Celts could never settle down, and the Queen&#39;s had a long way the best of it. Lambie, with an open field, would have scored, but Reynolds came in the way in the nick of time, and kicked the ball down the field.<br><br>Towards the close of the first half the Celts settled down somewhat, but they could not get the ball through, and the Queen&#39;s, keeping up the hot attack, continually kept their opponents on the run. Gillespie was playing a dashing, go-ahead game for the Queen&#39;s, and Hamilton rose to the occasion and nearly scored with a shot which went over the bar.<br><br>Some fine play by Campbell and McMahon resulted in the former shooting over the bar. The Celts were now playing with some pluck, and fairly besieged the Queen&#39;s goal, but just as every body thought the ball would go through it went past. the Celts were improving greatly, and were certainly having the best of it, although the Queen&#39;s were very watchful, Smellie in particular being very safe.<br><br>the closing stages of this half found the Celts in their true form, and they put in some warm work round Baird. McMahon would have scored, but he slipped at the critical moment. Dowds was playing a great game, and when everybody else failed he dashed in and robbed Hamilton of the ball.<br><br>At half-time neither side had scored.<br><br>Without delay the game was restarted. At the outset Smellie slipped in meting the ball, and the Celts would have scored but for Sillars pluckily stepping in and getting the ball away in the most determined manner. The Queen&#39;s retaliated in the most spirited fashion, and Robertson nearly got the ball through.<br><br>Again the Celts came away and forced their first corner, which proved fruitless. McMahon and Campbell were getting along nicely, but were charged, with the result that a foul was given, but Dowds shot wildly over the bar. The Queen&#39;s, by hard, dashing play, got right in front of the Celts&#39; goal, and a point looked inevitable, when Reynolds stepped in and saved. After some fine forward play by the Celts, Kelly got the ball and passed to McCallum, who tried a tricky low shot, which just missed.<br><br>After a quarter of an hour&#39;s play a great shout announced that the Celtic had scored. After a siege on the Queen&#39;s goal, Madden sent in a good one. Baird fell, but managed to return, but Campbell got the ball and rushed it through amidst great excitement. In less than a minute the Queen&#39;s scored, but the whistle had been blown previously for off-side, and the point was disallowed. The Celts came away, and, from a pass right along, Campbell nearly scored. The game continued very fast and exciting, and Doyle was cheered for a grand bit of play.<br><br>Much enthusiasm prevailed among the Queen&#39;s supporters as Sellar tore along the touchline, and finished up with a magnificent shot, which was headed out. The Queen&#39;s strove hard to equalise, but the defence of the Celts was very safe, Doyle and Reynolds in particular and Kelly showing fine form.<br><br>Still the Queen&#39;s never gave up hope. A corner fell to them, but it was of no avail, although Waddell had the hardest of lines.<br><br>Right on to the close the game was keenly contested, but the defence of Doyle and Reynolds was most stubborn, and the game ended - Celtic, 1 goal; Queen&#39;s Park, 0 goals.<br><br>Owing to the encroachment of the spectators, it was agreed in the first half that a friendly game only be played, and at a meeting of the SFA Committee at night it was decided that the tie be replayed on 9th April, and that the gate money be doubled.<br><br><br><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><b>Match report from Dublin newspaper Freeman&#39;s Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser Monday, March 14, 1892</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><img alt="1892-03-12: Celtic 1-0 Queen's Park, Scottish Cup [Void] - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/oSq6A421bAp4e1t3rB7Mcw234849" title="1892-03-12: Celtic 1-0 Queen's Park, Scottish Cup [Void] - The Celtic Wiki"> </div><br></div></div>
