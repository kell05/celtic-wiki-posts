How ridiculous is that?<br><br>&quot;Did he not see the armband I was wearing? I am captain of Celtic, I play for Scotland. I think I have made my name by now.<br><br>&quot;I   think it&#39;s more about him trying to make a name for himself again.   Let&#39;s face it, he only came to this league because he couldn&#39;t get a   game in England. No one would touch him with a bargepole.<br><br>&quot;So he&#39;s   come up to Scotland to try to make the most of what is left of his   career, which isn&#39;t much. Good luck to the lad. I look forward to seeing   how it all works out for him.&quot;<br><br>Brown&#39;s account of the flare-ups   begins in the opening minutes of the Ibrox clash when Diouf appealed in   vain for a free-kick after the pair had clashed in front of the main   stand.<br><br>He said: &quot;It started early in the game when Diouf didn&#39;t get a free kick for a challenge I made on him near the corner flag.<br><br>&quot;He   started moaning about that and trying to be the big man. He started   trying to trash talk me - saying how much money he has and how I&#39;m   skint.<br><br>&quot;To be fair I couldn&#39;t really grumble too much - the lad does have a bit of cash!<br><br>&quot;So   I didn&#39;t mind it too much but when I gave him a wee bit back he didn&#39;t   like it. If you&#39;re going to start giving it out you have to expect to   get a bit back but he just couldn&#39;t take it.<br><br>&quot;I said something about   his diamond tooth and he didn&#39;t seem to appreciate it very much. He  said  I couldn&#39;t afford one of my own and maybe he&#39;s right.<br><br>&quot;Fair  play to  the guy but if he wants to learn about scoring goals he should  nip over  to watch us train at Lennoxtown one afternoon and I&#39;ll show  him a thing  or two about finishing.<br>&quot;What has he scored? Three goals in three seasons in the Premiership? That&#39;s decent eh?<br><br>&quot;Look, I know I&#39;m hardly the most prolific goalscorer in the world but I&#39;d fancy myself to get more than that down there.&quot;<br><br>Brown admits the exchanges became more and more vile as the match thundered on.<br><br>He   said: &quot;It became very personal between us very quickly. I was actually   quite surprised by just how personal he got and the kind of things he   was saying about my family.<br><br>&quot;But I&#39;m a big boy. If he wants to go down that road then I&#39;m happy enough to go there too. I&#39;ll always give as good as I get.<br><br>&quot;He wanted to drag me into a battle and I was quite happy to oblige him. I think I came out of it on top and he knows it.<br><br>&quot;I   don&#39;t want to go into detail about what he said about my family. It  was  crude and it was vulgar but that&#39;s up to him. Yes, I did respond to  him  but what did he expect?<br>&quot;He just picked on the wrong guy.&quot;<br><br>Brown   insists he landed the knockout blow when he rifled home the stunning   second-half goal that took the fifth-round tie to a replay - and   guaranteed this pair must go head to head another FOUR times before the   season ends.<br><br>A beaming Brown was cautioned by ref Murray for turning   to gloat at Diouf after the ball had hit the back of Allan McGregor&#39;s   net.<br><br>Brown said: &quot;The celebration was brilliant and I don&#39;t regret it in the slightest. It was the best booking I&#39;ve had in my life.<br><br>&quot;If   I&#39;m honest I&#39;m not sure why I was booked because I didn&#39;t move and   didn&#39;t say a word. I just turned round and there he was right by my   side.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m not sure what I was thinking at the time. I was probably in a bit of shock at scoring with my left peg!<br><br>&quot;I was delighted with the goal - maybe I just wanted to share the moment with him!<br><br>&quot;I   wasn&#39;t trying to make him snap or get him sent off. I didn&#39;t think he   would spit in my face either because he&#39;s been in enough trouble over   stuff like that in the past.<br><br>&quot;It was all just a bit of banter as far   as I was concerned. I&#39;ve been wound up by loads of people on the park   and I&#39;ve done it to more than my fair share of opponents as well. It&#39;s   part of the game.&quot;<br>Now the hot-headed rivals are set to slug it out in four more Old Firm matches this term and Brown insists he can&#39;t wait.<br>He said: &quot;I enjoyed the battle. And I&#39;m looking forward to more.<br><br>&quot;But I&#39;m surprised he went running to a newspaper as soon as he was off the park to complain about me. What&#39;s that all about?<br><br>&quot;What   happens on the pitch should stay on the pitch but I&#39;m not going to   stand quietly back and let him say these things about me without   challenging it. If he wants to make this personal then I&#39;m good with   that too.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Scott Brown&#39;s blast: Celtic &#39;nobody&#39; fires back at Rangers&#39; El-Hadji Diouf</h3><br>By Peter Jardine and Mark Wilson<br>Last updated at 11:52 PM on 7th February 2011<br><br>   <br>Celtic skipper Scott Brown last night hit back at El-Hadji Diouf after the controversial<br>Rangers star labelled him a &lsquo;nobody&rsquo; who was only interested in getting him a red<br>card.<br><br>The  pair spent much of Sunday&rsquo;s 2-2 Scottish Cup thriller at Ibrox locked  in a personal battle, but Diouf would not buckle under the Celtic  captain&#39;s taunting or his confrontational goal celebration after Brown  brought his team level.<br><br>&lsquo;I refused to react,&rsquo; said Diouf yesterday. &lsquo;Why should I?

What&#39;s the best punch-up you&#39;ve seen?  When I was 12 or 13 I played for a youth team in Fife called Fulford  Royals. During one game something happened and all the parents and  coaching staff started fighting in the middle of the pitch. It was  mental. I can&#39;t remember what happened to kick it all off, but there  were punches thrown all over the place.<br><br>BENDER. What&#39;s the  biggest drinking session you&#39;ve been on? There have been a few. The  biggest was probably Paddy McCourt&#39;s stag-do at the end of last season.  There was a big crowd of us who went to the Algarve for a week and it  was pretty much non-stop boozing.<br><br>CLINGFILM OVER THE TOILET SEAT.  What is the best wind-up you&#39;ve seen? I&#39;ve seen loads of good pranks.  I&#39;ve covered people&#39;s cars in clingfilm, smashed eggs and flour over  people&#39;s cars. At Hibs, Kevin Thomson destroyed Gary Caldwell&#39;s clothes  and trainers by cutting them up with scissors. The best laugh, though,  was the day we tied Darren O&#39;Dea to a physio chair and pushed him down  the big hill at Lennoxtown. He couldn&#39;t move his feet or arms and was  totally helpless as we gave him a shove at the top and watched him  career down to the bottom before landing in a heap. The best of it was  that Gordon Strachan walked past us when we were doing it and just said  &#39;I&#39;ll leave you to it&#39;.<br><br>DUNCE. What were you like at school? I  really was a dunce at school. I went to Cowdenbeath High and hated every  minute of it. I couldn&#39;t get out of there quickly enough. I did  standard grades and my best mark was a 3 for maths and PE. You don&#39;t  want to know the rest.<br><br>EL HADJI DIOUF. What about your run-in  with him? I wish he was still at Rangers. I enjoyed playing against him &mdash;  it was quite easy. The way I look back on what happened between us is  that it was a big waste of money on their behalf signing him in the  first place. He wasn&#39;t the best player but caused chaos for them and  that&#39;s about it.<br><br>FIZZY JUICE. Do you really go hyper when you  drink some? Not any more. I&#39;ve chilled out now. The story came out when I  was with Scotland Under-21s and Maurice Malpas used to make sure I  didn&#39;t eat any chocolate or drink fizzy juice. I&#39;d ask him for some and  he&#39;d just refuse. The other boys would slaughter me about it but he was  probably right.<br><br>GIE&#39;S PEACE. Which Celtic player never shuts up?  None of the lads are too bad. The worst boy I&#39;ve known for constantly  talking is Ivan Sproule at Hibs. He&#39;s the most non-stop, hyperactive  person I&#39;ve ever come across. From the moment he arrived in the morning,  until the moment he walked out the door again, he&#39;d just never shut up.<br><br>HELL  ON EARTH. Where&#39;s the worst place you&#39;ve ever been? Belarus, without a  doubt. I was there with Scotland and the place is a s****hole. I hardly  slept because the bed was so small my legs dangled out the end. The  facilities were shocking &mdash; and we were in a five-star hotel as well!<br><br>IDOL.  Who was your hero growing up? Roy Keane was someone I loved watching.  He drove the team on with a sheer will to win. He was a brilliant  player, but I also thought it was great the way he was always in  people&#39;s faces.<br><br>JINGLE BELLS. What was your best Christmas  present ever? I got a table tennis table a couple of years ago and I  love that. It was my mum and dad who bought me it and it&#39;s set up in my  garage. I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m great, but I am getting better.<br><br>KARAOKE.  What do you sing? No chance, I&#39;m the worst singer in the world. I can&#39;t  hold a tune at all. Honestly, when we&#39;re lining up for Scotland I don&#39;t  sing the words because my voice is so bad.<br><br>LENNON. What is your  manager like before Celtic and huns games? He&#39;s quite calm. He just goes  round all the lads and has a quiet word. He then gets us going before  we run out. People might think he goes mental, but he&#39;s not like that.  It&#39;s the same with me. I&#39;m usually quite relaxed and focused. I try and  stay as chilled out as I&#39;d be for any other game. If I was to get  motivated too much I don&#39;t think it would help anyone. It&#39;s obviously  different when we get out on the pitch because of the noise the  supporters make. As captain I always say a few words in the huddle, but  I&#39;m pretty much wasting my breath because it&#39;s maybe only the guys  standing right beside me who can hear a word.<br><br>MENTAL What&#39;s the  most stupid thing you&#39;ve done? That&#39;s a difficult question because it&#39;s  quite a long list. Probably the daftest thing was when we were away with  Scotland Under-21s and were allowed to have a night out after a game. I  got so drunk I ended up crawling into the room, waking up Mark Wilson  and being sick all over the bed. I&#39;d been drinking tequila and was  steaming. Thankfully Willo looked after me that night and made sure I  was okay.<br><br>NAPPIES. How are you finding it being a dad? Great, I  love it. My son Shay was born about six months ago and he&#39;s brilliant.  It&#39;s obviously hard work getting up in the middle of the night and  changing nappies, but I think I&#39;m doing all right.<br><br>Celtic and RANGERS . What do you think of Rangers? They are a strong team, but I think  they&#39;re just going to try and play the long ball against us and try to  bully us again. This time, though, it&#39;s not going to work. They played  the second half of the last game like that and it came good for them,  but we&#39;ve learned our lesson.<br><br>POPCORN. Who would play you in a film?  Jim Carrey. I love that guy, he&#39;s the funniest man ever. Films like Liar  Liar and Dumb and Dumber are top class.<br><br>QUICK FIX. What are you  addicted to? Coffee. We were in Australia in the summer and Gary Hooper  converted me into a coffee drinker. Now, every morning on my way to  training, I stop at my local garage and get one for the journey.<br><br>ROOM-MATE.  Who do you share with? I used to share with Chris Killen, but now I&#39;m  in with Jamesy Forrest. The wee man sleeps far too much and also leaves  the room in a total mess.<br> <br>SCOTLAND. What do you remember about  your debut? It was against USA at Hampden and we drew 1-1, but I had a  goal disallowed for offside when I was a yard on. That still gets to me.  I was only 18. It was amazing just to be picked, but it would have been  even better to score.<br><br>TAT. You have a tattoo dedicated to your  sister Fiona, who sadly passed away. Is she a big inspiration? Yeah, her  memory helps me get through life. I now live every day as though it&#39;s  my last. Losing her is the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever had to deal with.<br><br>UNBELIEVABLE. Tell  us something we don&#39;t know about you? I have unbelievable tekkers.  Apart from that, I own a 21-foot boat. My wee brother Stewart and I go  fishing on the Forth. We usually just catch shopping trolleys, but we  love it.<br><br>VECTRA. What was your first car and what do you drive  now? My first car was a Fiat Punto which I had until just before I left  Hibs. I now have an Audi Q7.<br><br>WELDER. If you weren&#39;t a footballer what would you be? I have no idea. It would need to be something to do with fitness.<br><br>XBOX.  Are you into console games? Yeah, I play Call of Duty online. A few of  the lads play each other, but Daryl Murphy is so good at it it&#39;s  ridiculous.<br><br>YOU&#39;RE ON A DESERT ISLAND AND CAN TAKE THREE THINGS WITH YOU... I&#39;d need a coffee machine, my golf clubs &mdash; and my boat.<br><br>ZZZZ. What bores you? Cricket. It&#39;s not even a proper sport. They&#39;ve a cheek to have a World Cup. What a complete waste of time.</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Leadership gives Scott Brown a special glow</h3>The Scotsman<br>Published on Wednesday 11 April 2012 00:00<br><br>SCOTT Brown has the handprint of his son tattooed on his arm. Now there is another indelible stamp to go with it &ndash; the mark of a championship skipper.<br><br>Brown never doubted he would know how it feels to walk in the footsteps of the likes of Paul Lambert and Tom Boyd sooner or later. He won the title under then captain Stephen McManus four years ago. But, like manager Neil Lennon, he has acknowledged that leading the side to glory adds an extra special dimension.<br><br>It doesn&rsquo;t feel like vindication, he insists, since he knew he made the right decision to sign for Celtic rather than Rangers in 2007. But there was an undeniable sweetness in being the skipper when the side finally wrested the title back from their Ibrox rivals. &ldquo;I would not have signed for Celtic if I did not think it was the right club for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my first season we had so many highs &ndash; we won the league and it was brilliant. After that it has not been quite as good, but this season has topped everything.&rdquo;<br><br>Even the minor let-down of being denied the opportunity to parade around Rugby Park with the trophy was brushed off by Brown yesterday, as he reflected on the achievement. &ldquo;Another five weeks is all right after four years,&rdquo; he shrugged, with reference to how long Celtic have had to endure being left in Rangers&rsquo; slipstream. &ldquo;I am not really sure why this is either,&rdquo; he wondered, when asked why the formal presentation is being delayed so long. &ldquo;It would have been great to have the trophy &ndash; but we will get that in time,&rdquo; he added.<br><br>Brown thoroughly enjoyed the occasion even in the absence of the trophy, which will be presented to the players at the final home game against Hearts. He had the best of both worlds &ndash; he played in the first half as Celtic racked up a four-goal lead, and then sat back and relaxed on the sidelines as the visitors continued their canter towards victory.<br><br>He was replaced a minute into the second-half after feeling a &ldquo;niggle&rdquo; in his groin. &ldquo;Better to be safe than sorry,&rdquo; he said, ahead of this weekend&rsquo;s William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final clash with Hearts at Hampden Park.<br><br>Although he is the type who wants to play every minute of each game, Brown enjoyed watching his side, who, he revealed, had been told to &ldquo;express yourselves&rdquo; by Lennon.<br><br>&ldquo;I was on the bench and Charlie [Mulgrew] came off as well. At the time we were four or 5-0 up and we knew it was going to be one of those good days,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We were talking to each other and thinking how good this could be.&rdquo; It was a very different experience to watching from his sofa as Celtic slipped three goals behind Kilmarnock in the first half of that pivotal meeting back in October. Brown was injured and tuned in as his side exhibited every sign that they were missing their inspirational skipper.<br><br>&ldquo;I had faith in the lads to go out and make a point,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They definitely made a point. That&rsquo;s when our season changed, because it put pressure on Rangers as well. I think they also dropped points that day.<br><br>&ldquo;It was hard to take,&rdquo; he added, when asked how he felt at half-time, knowing he could not affect the situation. &ldquo;But we came back from 3-0 down to 3-3. There&rsquo;s not a lot of clubs who can do that. It showed how good the team spirit is and what the lads can do, no matter if we are one or two down. We know we have done it before.&rdquo;<br><br>They could not quite overcome the three-goal lead Rangers established against Celtic in the last Old Firm fixture, and Brown is relishing the opportunity to square the series of four league games this season against their oldest rivals. &ldquo;We were favourites at Ibrox &ndash; and that&rsquo;s the first time that has happened in as many years as I can think of,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whatever happened happened, but we can now bring them back to our place and we definitely want revenge.&rdquo;<br><br>Although the league is wrapped up, other challenges await Celtic, including a significant one on Sunday. &ldquo;This season is definitely not over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have a semi-final and hopefully a final, and five big games left in the league as well.&rdquo;<br><br>Brown knows he will be a target for the Hearts supporters on Sunday after his association with Hibs. The all-Edinburgh Scottish Cup semi-final of 2006 is another game he missed due to injury, perhaps fortunately. &ldquo;I love an injury!&rdquo; he smiled, looking back at a game which Hibs lost 4-0. &ldquo;I was in the stand &ndash; me and Derek Riordan. I think I had broken my foot or my ankle. That was a hard one to take.&rdquo;<br><br>He elected to keep under wraps what the team did to celebrate on Saturday night, following the triumphant return to Parkhead. But he was happy to reveal his choice as Celtic&rsquo;s player of the year, with Charlie Mulgrew edging ahead of James Forrest. The team, he said, is &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; as it is. Brown believes they are well equipped to deal with the challenge of the Champions League qualifiers, which begin in July. &ldquo;Winning the league by 18 points shows we don&rsquo;t need older, experienced pros. The lads are mature enough to understand that it is a big club,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is lot of pressure on us to win every week and they want to be here and enjoy it. They want to win trophies.&rdquo;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Celtic captain Scott Brown may only feature in Champions League because of degenerative hip problem             </h3><br>By ANDREW SMITH <br>Published on Sunday 2 September 2012 01:32<br><br>SCOTT  Brown&rsquo;s degenerative hip problem may result in the Celtic captain being  considered only for Champions League matches, his manager Neil Lennon  has revealed.<br><br>Brown, who will miss Scotland&rsquo;s World Cup  qualifying double header because of the condition, needed an injection  to play as Celtic beat Helsingborgs on Wednesday to qualify for the  Champions League group stage.<br><br>The player might not be seen again  until Celtic host Benfica on 19 September. And Lennon is concerned the  27-year-old could be lost to the club even for European games such is  the extent of the hip problem.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want him to miss Scotland  games and he doesn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; said Lennon. &ldquo;But it might even come to  the point where he has to miss European games if he has a reaction, is  in too much pain to play, or we have to shut him down for a concerted  period of time. The fact it is degenerative means he will eventually  need a prolonged rest but we don&rsquo;t want to do that so early in the  season. So, if we can just nurse him along, rest him here and there, he  might just cope with that.&rdquo;<br><br>MEMORIES of Benfica&rsquo;s last Champions  League visit to Celtic Park are sure to remain vivid for Scott Brown.  The Portuguese side, who will provide the opposition when Celtic open up  their group stage campaign at home in little over a fortnight, left the  field in November 2007 to a cacophony of boos. Brown, for his part, was  simply relieved to be able to depart on two feet.<br><br>The  midfielder, who had joined in a &pound;4.4 million deal from Hibernian that  summer, was the victim of an appalling assault five minutes from time.  His halving brought a red-card for perpetrator Gilles Binya, who was  subsequently banned for six matches. After a hush replaced celebrations  of the impending 1-0 victory, Brown hauled himself up and continued to  buzz around as manically as he had before. The then 22-year-old seemed  indestructable. Five years on, the now Celtic captain appears  vulnerable. So much so that his manager Neil Lennon has confessed the  club will need to &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; an increasingly influential performer through a  degenerative hip problem to have any hope of deploying him in the Group  G fixtures against Barcelona, Spartak Moscow and the Lisbon side.<br><br>Brown&rsquo;s  presence in these encounters won&rsquo;t be craved by supporters in the same  way they will be desperate for latest arrivals, in the form of Nigerian  defender Efe Ambrose and Venezuelan striker Miku, to be accommodated.  Neither is the midfielder a matchwinner in the mould of James Forrest,  Kris Commons, Gary Hooper or Georgios Samaras. Yet, there is a growing  appreciation of his importance to his team and his re-invention as a  seasoned campaigner and sensible performer. That is evidenced in no  small part by the club&rsquo;s willingness to go to extreme measures in order  to ensure his chronic hip problem does not count him out.<br><br>The  player has been, and will be it seems, patched up only for European  encounters this season. Celtic have proved far more adept on the  continent than domestically for reasons beyond that. Yet the considered  and composed contributions of Brown, once dismissed as no more than  bulldog terrier on speed, must be a factor. Lennon is in no doubt about  Brown&rsquo;s worth. The Irishman watched the midfelder assume the mantle  demanded by the armband he sports as Helsingborgs were removed from  Celtic&rsquo;s path to the Champions League in convincing fashion on Wednesday  night. Brown&rsquo;s efforts were all the more commendable because he is  suffering acutely with his hip complaint.<br><br>&ldquo;He saw a specialist  and, although the problem hasn&rsquo;t deteriorated, he was in a lot of pain  [on] Monday and Tuesday,&rdquo; said the manager. &ldquo;Under the circumstances he  had a great game. He was a real driving force for the team. He&rsquo;s really  matured. A lot of the earlier stuff, the gallussness, has gone, and you  have to say with his discipline on the field he&rsquo;s really blossomed into  his role of captain.&rdquo;<br><br>Yet, it might mean too much to Brown to be  the leader on the field. It was put to Lennon that he might be facing a  Ledley King situation with the 27-year-old Scot. King, famously,  practically never trained in his final years at Tottenham Hotspur  because of a wrecked knee, and his game-time was rationed as a result.  The Celtic manager said he didn&rsquo;t think the Brown situation is &ldquo;as  serious as that scenario&rdquo; but cautioned that it is up to his captain to  prevent it becoming so.<br><br>&ldquo;We have to manage him, maybe train him  once or twice a week,&rdquo; Lennon said. &ldquo;He has to be honest with us,  though. He has to say &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a bit stiff today&rsquo; or &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a bit sore&rsquo;. He  felt a bit sore on Tuesday after training on Monday, but he trained  anyway when he should have been saying &lsquo;Can I leave it today?&rsquo;<br><br>&ldquo;That  makes it worse sometimes. But he likes to train and be out there  burning off energy so we&rsquo;re going to have to temper that now. You just  hope this situation settles down eventually. The fact it&rsquo;s degenerative  means eventually he&rsquo;ll need a prolonged rest, but we don&rsquo;t want to do  that so early in the season. So if we can just manage him along and  nurse him, rest him here and there, he might cope with that.&rdquo;<br><br>Brown&rsquo;s  participation in the Champions League may represent a risk for Celtic.  The club were not prepared to take the risk of contesting the group  stages without their most saleable midfield asset, however. It is  believed that Victor Wanyama may have been amenable to a switch to the  English Premier League before the window closed. The Kenyan midfielder  is understood to have been the subject of a near &pound;6m bid by Queens Park  Rangers. His late goal in the 2-0 victory over Helsingborgs helped make  certain that offer would not be entertained by the Scottish champions.  The 21-year-old maintains his focus is only on what lies ahead for  Celtic in Group G.<br><br>&ldquo;I came here for one reason and the reason was  to play in the Champions League,&rdquo; Wanyama said. &ldquo;I am looking forward  to the Champions League and I don&rsquo;t think about leaving just now. We are  playing in the Champions League against the big clubs of Europe.&rdquo;<br><br>The  player said he just heard &ldquo;from other people&rdquo; about QPR&rsquo;s interest and  denied he was disappointed it was rebuffed, as has been reported in  certain press outlets. &ldquo;No, no. I am just happy and looking forward to  the Champions League,&rdquo; he stated in response to this suggestion. Lennon  is believed to have let him know in no uncertain terms he would be  retained for the duration of the season. &ldquo;The manager is happy and I am  happy here,&rdquo; Wanyama said of reports he took him aside to tell him to  forget about a transfer. &ldquo;He has been talking to me but I was not even  thinking of leaving. The only chance I wanted was to play in the  Champions League.&rdquo; Achieving that objective is something his captain  Brown will require to take a chance <br><br><a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/sport/celtic-captain-scott-brown-may-only-feature-in-champions-league-because-of-degenerative-hip-problem-1-2502043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/scotland-on-sunday/sport/celtic-captain-scott-brown-may-only-feature-in-champions-league-because-of-degenerative-hip-problem-1-2502043</a><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>Training hard, Scott?

Jim McLean, the former Dundee United manager, once articulated  his despair at goalkeeper Hamish McAlpine&rsquo;s eccentric ways by claiming  &ldquo;he is the one player who single-handedly destroys everything I have  thought or believed about the game&rdquo;.<br>Similarly, Scott Brown has  now handed Ronny Deila, together with all other managers who worship at  the altar of sports science, reason to reassess.<br>As Brown helped  run the League Cup final for Celtic yesterday, there were clearly no  ill-effects of the excesses that saw him, literally, plastered all over  the front page of a tabloid on Friday. Brown even seemed to make comic  reference to the stooshie by rubbing his tummy amid the celebrations at  the end.<br>It was a reference, perhaps, to the fast food  nourishment he was photographed delicately eating on a kerbside on  Wednesday night. A hug from Deila proved there were no hard feelings.  Indeed, Brown continues to bring new meaning to being let off  Scott-free. Some would argue that this extends to referees.<br><div class="spoiler">Yesterday  saw another decision appear to go his way after he nudged Ryan Dow over  in the box in the first-half. United players were still venting their  frustration in the bowels of Hampden long after the final whistle.  Brown, meanwhile, was being feted by the Celtic supporters; forgiveness  already assured.<br><br>Once was the time when &ldquo;doing a Broonie&rdquo; meant  standing bug-eyed in front of an identified foe with arms outstretched.  Now it has come to mean something else.<br><br>Now it means going on a  bender in less salubrious parts of town four days before a major  assignment. It means over-doing it to the extent that you are found  slumped in a street before the clock has even struck midnight. Not  necessarily a problem if you are a journalist of course (we&rsquo;ve all been  there, Scott).<br><br>But it&rsquo;s perhaps trickier to explain if you happen  to be the captain of Celtic and Scotland. Making things more awkward is  the fact the manager of Celtic is a stickler for players following a  code of conduct when it comes to their personal well-being. Deila  relentlessly espouses the need to be &ldquo;a 24-hour athlete&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s  reasonable to assume he isn&rsquo;t so keen on the 24-hour-party animal  approach.<br><br>Of course, Brown&rsquo;s argument (unsurprisingly, he  declined to speak to reporters yesterday) is likely to be that he was  home before midnight. It was almost four days before the game. Perhaps  in private moments, he would also claim he is too good to drop anyway.  He might well also point out that it is obvious he is one of the most  committed trainers at the club &ndash; the six-pack he is not averse to  displaying at the end of games has not appeared of its own accord.<br><br>Much  of yesterday&rsquo;s pre-match build-up concerned itself with one burning  question: Will Broonie play? That question was answered with the release  of the teamsheets.<br><br>Not only was Brown playing, he retained the  armband. Either his apology had been sincere enough for Deila to  compromise his principles or else Deila has changed his view on this  &ldquo;24-hour-athlete&rdquo; thing. Actually, there is a third possibility; perhaps  the manager realised Celtic&rsquo;s chances of winning a game representing  the first part of a hoped-for historic treble were better with Brown in  the team than out of it.<br><br>Although he played the whole 90 minutes  yesterday, and played well, ask yourself this: what would have happened  had Anthony Stokes been photographed in such a state in Dublin on  Wednesday night? Chances are he would have been nowhere near yesterday&rsquo;s  cup final line-up.<br><br>If Deila did decide Brown was too valuable to  lose, then the skipper&rsquo;s subsequent performance supported this view. He  might have lost his first challenge when John Rankin came away with the  ball. But, in the matter of who came out top in that particular  midfield battle, there was only one winner.<br><br>Brown&rsquo;s determination  was already well-established. His stare bore into the tunnel wall as he  prepared to lead his side out. Against a background of those squawking  about whether he should be playing or not, he knew he had to deliver.  There he was in the warm-up, the only one in a white tee-shirt, as  always. While the rest of his teammates wore tracksuits zipped up to  their chin, Brown dared the goose-pimples to march up his arm. Rather  than concentrate on silly shuttle runs, he spent his entire time hitting  40-yard passes down the touchline. It seemed to underline how, when it  comes to Brown, different rules apply.<br><br>Some, mostly of the  tangerine persuasion, will contend that he shouldn&rsquo;t have been able to  play in any case. His studs up challenge on Nadir Ciftci in the Scottish  Cup game was reckoned by many &ndash; though, crucially, not the Scottish  Football Association&rsquo;s compliance officer &ndash; to have been worth a red  card.<br><br>There were always going to be vendettas left over from last  week. Indeed, Ryan McGowan had gone on national radio and advised Brown  to put a lid on it, after he&rsquo;d accused United of diving in that fiery  Scottish Cup clash last Sunday. There was little surprise when the  Australian became the first player booked yesterday for a crunching late  challenge on, yes, Brown.<br><br>Amateur leap readers watching on  television later reported something McGowan said about &ldquo;last week&rdquo; when  complaining to the referee, Bobby Madden. Clearly, he felt that his  challenge was no worse than the one Brown made on Ciftci at Tannadice.<br><br>This latest week in the life of Scott Brown has done little to harm the legend.<br><br>What  Gordon Strachan has to say on the matter today when naming his squad  for next week&rsquo;s Northern Ireland clash will be interesting. But then the  Scotland manager has also always stoutly defended Brown.<br><br>Even  Strachan, another of those managers who has strict views on footballers  and alcohol, is hardly going to start criticising him now. In fact, he  may likely quip that all players should &ldquo;do the Broonie&rdquo;.</div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/2916778/brendan-rodgers-celtic-scott-brown-eboue-kouassi/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"><font color="#0066cc"><span class="diffAdd">https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/eboue-kouassi/</span></font></a><br></h3><span class="diffAdd">BRENDAN RODGERS is Celtic boss in name.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Scott Brown, Celtic boss by nature.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">That&rsquo;s how Eboue Kouassi sees it, with the Ivory Coast youngster looking at Hoops skipper Brown with nothing but respect.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Rodgers need not worry. Kouassi, 20, isn&rsquo;t showing any lack of respect to his gaffer.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Kouassi simply sees Brown as Celtic&rsquo;s driving force and someone he looks up to and admires as &lsquo;the boss on the pitch&rsquo;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He said: &ldquo;Scott Brown is a big guy, a main guy for Celtic.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;When he plays, I always look to how he plays because he has such a big mentality over the entire team.
