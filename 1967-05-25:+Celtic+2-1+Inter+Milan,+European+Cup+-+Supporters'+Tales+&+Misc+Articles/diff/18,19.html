The reason for this decision was  not that a  new kitchen was needed, or an extension needed to be built  or anything  else like that. No the decision was made when the final  whistle went at  Celtic park with the result that Celtic had beaten  Ducla Prague by 3  goals to 1. The oul fella had argued that if Celtic  won by two clear  goals then the trip to the bank was on. What he had in  mind was a gamble  but Stein&rsquo;s team did not lose two goal advantages&ndash;  and he had seen  enough of Ducla that night to believe that Celtic would  go to Lisbon.<br><br>By the following week, he had collected the money raised and he had spent most of it!<br><br>It   was nearly all gone by the time Celtic kicked off in the afternoon   match in Prague. As there was no football coverage on TV he had to call   back by phone from London to my mother to find out the score from   Prague. I would guess that he was slightly nervous, and his nerves were   made all the worse when he could not get a word out of the mother on  the  phone&ndash; all she did was cry!!<br><br>Presuming that the unimaginable  had  happened, he began to try and calm her down over the phone,  telling her  that though they had lost a few quid, everything would be  ok and that  it was not the end of the world and that he would make the  money back  again. Somehow, the mother managed to blurt out four words: &rdquo;  We won&ndash;  we&rsquo;re through!&rdquo;&ndash; and that changed the tone of the conversation  totally.<br><br>Putting the phone down the father scurried off about his business.<br><br>Not long after, a man politely knocked on the door of his boss. The Boss man was a small bespectacled man in a dapper suit.<br><br>&rdquo;   Sorry, sir, but there is a man in reception asking to see you and who   says that it is urgent. When I asked him what he wanted, he said that  he  wanted to hire every one of your planes for three days in May. He is   clearly deranged and I have called for the police and an Ambulance&ndash;  but  in case there is a commotion I suggest you stay in here for the  time  being&rdquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;What did he want the planes for?&rdquo; said the boss<br><br>&rdquo; Some rubbish about a football match and a team from Glasgow&mdash; He says that Celtic are in the European Cup Final in Lisbon.&rdquo;<br><br>&rdquo; And are they?&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&ndash; I just thought he was mad!&rdquo;<br><br>The   Boss man then picked up the phone and called the Daily Express and   asked where the European Cup final was to be played and who was in it.   Lisbon was the correct answer and as for the participants&ndash; well that   would be Glasgow Celtic and either Internazionale or CSKA Red Flag who   were to play that night.<br><br>The Boss man came out to the reception   to meet with another small bespectacled man who had the remainder of the   remortgage money in his bag.<br><br>&rdquo; Hello&rdquo; said the boss man &rdquo; I&rsquo;m Freddie Laker.&rdquo;<br><br>For   those too young to remember Freddie Laker, he started Laker airlines  in  1966 and tried to establish the company as a charter company flying   people and mail all over. He later went on to be knighted and to   challenge British Airways on their transatlantic routes. His was the   first real budget scheduled airline, but in 1967 no one had ever heard   of him and no one had tried to book all of his planes at once!<br><br>Ultimetely   the oul fella flew 17 planes to Lisbon. He knew and saw that not only   were the team capable of remarkebale things but that the Celtic support   would travel in vast numbers to the Portuguese capitol. Some drove,  some  trained, but the majority flew and this was the first mass airlift  of  football fans in Europe. That is often forgotten. In those days the   final was played somewhere and the majority of spectators were local  to  the chosen stadium. The travelling football army was a Celtic first  and  each time it has had the chance to invade foreign soil for a final  it  grows from the time before&mdash;- Lisbon, Milan, Seville.<br><br>I still  have  unused tickets for that day in May 1967. I also have treasured   photographs of my dad and my grandfather with his chosen guest who he   took to Lisbon to see Celtic lift the cup. He , like many others, had no   doubt that Stein&rsquo;s team would win. The Guest was one of my Dad&rsquo;s   favourite players and someone he would have put into his team in   response to Serge&rsquo;s post. The Player and guest was Charles Patrick   Tully.<br><br>Much has been written about that day in Lisbon, but what   sticks with me is that how different things are now compared to then,   how the world and the game has moved on.<br><br>In 1967 loads of people   in England and elsewhere did not follow European football at all. Other   than Real Madrid coming to play the final in Glasgow,the event was not   much covered in the British Isles. There had been a general feeling   within the English FA that Europe was not for English teams. Further it   was a latin dominated event.<br><br>However among those who did follow   European Football there was a feeling that the free flowing football of   Real Madrid was a thing of the past. The Inter team played an  unbeatable  form of football, cynical football, professionally efficient  football&ndash;  get in front and kill the game.<br><br>Barry Davis had a  great series on  radio 5 a number of years ago called the great European  teams and in  it, he concluded that the Celtic team of 1967-72 was  undoubtedly the  best team in Europe going by consistent results. But  the key was that  everyone of a neutral hue wanted them to win. Inter&rsquo;s  dearest player  cost &pound;250,000 in 1967&ndash; which was a fortune then. It was a  team designed  to stop Madrid and later Benfica and to dominate  football with it&rsquo;s all  efficient system.<br><br>For the press, Lisbon  &lsquo;67 was good against bad,  light against dark, football against the anti  footballing ideology of  Herrera. The idea that Stein could produce  this local team which played  such magnificent football was like a  fairytale&ndash; the stuff of Hollywood.  And win they did. A friend of mine,  who is a Rangers fan, described it  as the day Celtic THRASHED Inter  Milan by two goals to one. It was a  footballing lesson&ndash; a beating to  beat all beatings. A masterclass in  entertaining attacking football.<br><br>But  it brought about so much  more than just a win. It was the precursor to  total football in Holland.  It deeply influenced how the Brazil team of  1970 would play against  many of the same players in an Italy shirt in  the world cup final. The  pictures also advertised this idea of the vast  travelling football  support and of course the Freddie Lakers of this  world realised there  was money in football charters.<br><br><h3><span class="diffAdd">Glasgow Airport</span></h3><img align="bottom" alt="1967-05-25: Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, European Cup - Supporters' Tales & Misc Articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="395" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/14017d71b948db0dc687da969ca48edf/GW500H395" title="1967-05-25: Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, European Cup - Supporters' Tales & Misc Articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="500"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>My  Dad is a faithful Celtic supporter who follows the club everywhere.   He&#39;s not sectarian in his outlook at all and neither was my Granda who   changed religion to marry my Gran. Granda was a supporter but didn&#39;t   attend too many games. He was a gentle giant.<br><br>The only time my   Granda ever skelped my Dad was during the &#39;67 final when they were   watching the game on TV. When Chalmers scored the winner for some   inexplicable reason my Dad (about 13 at the time) leapt to his feet and   screamed &#39;We&#39;ll burn down the Orange hall tonight!&#39; WTF! Why would you   even say that. <br><br>My  Granda leapt to his feet too and promptly  back-hand slapped my Dad  across the room for what he said and that was  how they celebrated the  goal that won the Big Cup.<br><b>(Henrik The King of KDS forum, <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8517817/2/?x=50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2011</a>)</b><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>A few memories of that day.</h3><br>We  arrived at Lisbon to be greeted at  the airport by the great Charlie  Tully. Through the travel agency that  took the majority of fans who  flew to Lisbon, the word went out that  Charlie would lose his job (with  a sports manufacturer in Belfast) if  the Celtic fans booed God Save  the Queen - those were the days!) In the  event, they didn&#39;t play any  national anthems.<br><br>What I remember  about central Lisbon was how I  kept meeting old school friends (I had  only left the year before). The  other thing I remember is how the city  was full of totally  impoverished soldiers carrying rifles who were so  grateful if you gave  them a drink (alcohol was incredibly cheap and you  could buy beer in  the ground). It didn&#39;t surprise me that a few years  later the army  overthrew the fascist regime.<br><br>As most of us were  Catholics then  and most Catholics went to mass then, we headed for a  church &ndash; I think  it was a cathedral - as it was a holiday of obligation.  There were a  few old ladies in black, a few rich people with sits  inside the altar  area -  kind of feudal - and masses of Celtic fans with  scarves and  banners. The locals were totally bemused. <br><br>It was an  all-seated  stadium but you had to sit on concrete unless you bought a  cushion. You  could also move round the ground. We went from one end of  the stadium  to the other at half-time so we could be behind the Inter  goal. We were  convinced that it was never a penalty (it clearly was!) I  remember  before the winner was scored we were all discussing how we were  going  to get to Amsterdam where the replay was due to be played a few  days  later . Was there extra time then? I don&rsquo;t remember but there were  no  penalty shoot-outs or tossing a coin. There was no question of us  just  going home.<br><br>At the end a few valiant Tims ran onto the park   dodging the police batons but by the second and subsequent waves they   gave up. On the park I met all the school friends I had missed in the   town centre. I have an abiding memory of Big Billy, high up in the   stand, holding the Cup aloft. The stadium&rsquo;s architecture was like a   Roman amphitheatre and I always though Billy&rsquo;s nickname Caesar came from   that (rather than something to do with Cesar Romero.)<br><br>On the  way  back, my mate had an earlier plane than me so when the his plane  left I  fell asleep &ndash; we&rsquo;d had a few by then and I was young and not  used to  drinking beer and cognac (at a pre-decimal 3p equivalent) all  day. I  don&rsquo;t have any memory of subsequent events until I woke up as  the plane  was landing in Glasgow but what apparently happened was that I  missed my  plane and the cops stopped a bus going from the airport  building to the  runway and said, &ldquo;take this man to Glasgow&rdquo;. Luckily  one of my  brother&rsquo;s mates was on the bus and he recognized me, got me  smuggled  onto the plane, put me in his seat and hid in the toilet. He  was  discovered but the &ldquo;driver&rdquo; of the plane (we weren&rsquo;t used to  flying!)  relented and let me stay on. <br><br>That night we were back  at Celtic  Park to welcome the team back and then to the Crown Bar where  the hero  of the previous night &ndash; the one who got me onto the plane &ndash;  sat bubbling  into his beer. We really weren&rsquo;t expecting to win against  the mighty  Inter.<br><br><b>(JinkDemy of KDS Forum, <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8517817/2/?x=50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2011</a>)</b><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>I  HAD thought since Seville that there must be hundreds, maybe   thousands, of Celtic fans who had seen all three of the club&rsquo;s European   finals until it was pointed out just what a sweep of time this entailed   and how young so many of the hordes in Spain were.<br><br>So maybe it  is  time for a triple veteran to do some comparing and contrasting and   maybe it might as well be me. Just to make things easier, the three   finals, on and off the field, do seem to fall into distinctive   categories.<br><br>LISBON was a dream, MILAN was a nightmare and SEVILLE was qualified joy.<br><br>To   understand Lisbon, you have to go back a couple of years from 1967 and   realise that Celtic then were a side of skilled players who never won   anything and who didn&rsquo;t look capable of coalescing into a team that   would.<br><br>Then along came Jock Stein and things started happening   fast, so fast that there was a surreal quality to those days after the   defeat of Dukla Prague, so much so that, on the flight to the final, I   asked my mate if he could really believe we were on our way to see   Celtic facing their last hurdle to winning the European Cup. He couldn&rsquo;t   either.<br><br>I&rsquo;m not going to add to the millions of words already   written about the game itself, except to say that if ever there was a   dream that was it. This quality was added to by the city, the weather   and the enthusiasm of the Portuguese for the way Celtic played. We even   got smiles from the police and in a fascist country, as Portugal then   was, that really is the stuff of dreams.<br><br>With all of this, plus a   glass or six of vinho verde, we could probably have flown home without   an aeroplane. Our reverie only ended when we saw the Cup being paraded   round Parkhead. That was reality. Our team, the side that not so long   ago seemingly couldn&rsquo;t win anything, were European champions. Even at   that, there were moments in the months ahead when we had to stop and   convince ourselves anew that it had all really happened.<br><br>It   couldn&rsquo;t have been more different in Milan. This was going to be easy   peasy. True, the Dutch were better than they used to be but no match for   the team of skill and experience that had beaten Leeds United twice.  An  attitude, by the way, that seems to have been shared by Big Jock.  And  when, as in Lisbon, Tommy Gemmell scored, that approach seemed   justified. Now we were going to sit back and enjoy ourselves. Well, we   sat back but we sure as hell didn&rsquo;t enjoy ourselves.<br><br>The   nightmare had begun earlier, though most of us hardly noticed. I was on   my own this time, though due to meet up with some colleagues for a   little vox popping, an arrangement that fell through, surely an omen.<br><br>Milan   was on strike, something that became very clear when we went to get   into the San Siro. I think everybody made it but not always to the seats   they had bought. But the problems really started when we left the   stadium. In our traumatised state, we could have done without finding   that all the buses that were to whisk us to the airport seemed to have   been moved. Eventually, it looked as if people were getting on the first   Parks of Hamilton or similar they saw and hoping for the best.<br><br>The   airport was worse. You might think the endless delays would have   allowed us to catch a little much-needed sleep. No chance. The police   kept moving us on or, rather, round and round. In the end I did two   complete circuits of the departure lounge before I was finally ushered   on to a plane, not the flight I was booked on, needless to say.<br><br>Any   good memories? Just two. An all-too-brief look at Milan Cathedral was   one. To say I am sceptical about religion, any religion, would be   something of an understatement but a belief that can inspire a creation   as beautiful as this must have something going for it. And the airport   wine, used medicinally, you understand, helped dull our pain a little.<br><br>And   so, 33 years on, to Seville, accompanied this time by two sons and a   grandson and with the prospect of two days by the sea, as well as the   main event. All very civilised, compared to the two wildly contrasting   day trips of the past.<br><br>Apart from that, the biggest difference in   Seville was, of course, the sheer volume of fans. There had been a  fair  exodus to Lisbon by plane, train and just about anything you could  call  a motor vehicle, Milan had a better turnout than it deserved but   nothing could compare with the green and white hordes in Spain. I don&rsquo;t   think I ever felt more at home or prouder to be a Celtic supporter.<br><br>To   say, as some have done, that Seville, with its magical atmosphere that   day, was so terrific that the result was almost irrelevant is not so   much a clich&eacute;, more pure baloney. Of course it hurt but, compared to   Milan, this defeat was a triumph. And that is why the whole experience   was joyous, with the joy qualified.<br><br>Certainly, it was more like   Lisbon than Milan. For me it was summed up by sitting on a pavement,   still warm at one am, discussing the game with my grandson. We agreed   that we were proud of our team and their manager. We didn&rsquo;t grudge Porto   their victory. Jose Mourinho had put together a pretty formidable and   entertaining side. It was just a pity he wanted them to be nominated  for  Academy Awards as well. And the Porto fans seemed a pretty decent  lot.  Defeat is never sweet but unlike Milan, this was bearable.<br><br>And  a  fourth final, perhaps? Why not? Only, the gap between Milan and  Seville  was 33 years. Try to narrow it a bit next time, you heroes in  green and  white. 2036 would be pushing it a bit &ndash; at least for me.<br><br>&copy; Sandy Williamson <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>Passport photos - 7/6<br>Visitors passport - 2/6<br>Flights &amp; ticket from a travel agent at Partick Cross - &pound;19 (10/- extra for 200 fags anaw)<br>Bus from St. Enoch to Abbotsinch Airport - 2/6<br>Currency restrictions in force, so, escudos -  &pound;5<br><br>Memories - Priceless.<br><br>I   went to the airport on the Wednesday night for the 6 am Thursday  flight  and fully expected to get a couple of hours kip whilst waiting.  Naive  or what. It was quite quiet until about midnight when the rest of  the  airborne force started arriving. The police and security just gave  up  asking the troops to be quiet. Bumped into an old school pal and as  luck  would have it we were both on the same plane.<br><br>I remember  there  was a wee old priest on the plane who was asking for divine  intervention  as we took off (don&#39;t know if he was afraid of flying or  wanting a  result).<br><br>Plane lands in Lisbon. Big holdup, presumably  because  their immigration &amp; passport control are being  overwhelmed. Kept on  the plane in sweltering heat  with hardly any  ventilation for nearly an  hour. Eventually got released, walked across  the tarmac to the airport  buildings and standing (almost) there was  Charlie Tully and shaking  everyone&#39;s hand.<br><br>Transferred by coach  to City centre, quick look  about and end up outside a Church. It being a  holiday of ob. we went to  see if we could catch a quick mass, failing  that, another wee request  for divine intervention. As luck would have  it there was a mass  scheduled to start in a few minutes. As others have  posted, inside the  church there was a good few locals, totally bemused  and surrounded by  hundreds of Tims. Definitely standing room only and  even then it would  be on the terrace outside.<br><br>After that, a bit  of lunch, a wee walk  about and a coach to the stadium. Again, as others  have posted, it was  much as I would imagine The Coliseum to have been,  at least both ends  and one side, stone terracing on which you could  sit or stand. The  remaining side seemed to have been a temporary  scaffolding structure and  for some reason I seem to remember it was  bedecked in Inter&#39;s colours.<br><br>Disappointed  to lose the penalty  (stonewaller) but never at any time did we lose  belief. The more the  match went on the more it became obvious that it  was only a matter of  time before the equaliser and ultimately the  winner(s) would come.  Inter&#39;s goalie that day, Sarti I think, was  immense but even he could  not prevent the inevitable. The rest is  history.<br><br>Taxi back to the city centre, loadsa beer, bus to the airport.<br><br>In   the airport there was a wee guy dishing out free samples of miniature   bottles of wine. Just looking at mine and it was &quot;Alto Corgo&quot; and the   number on the neck-label is 331132.<br><br>My experience of the return   flight gives credence to many of the otherwise unbelievable stories that   I have heard. The airport staff were more concerned with getting   everyone on a plane, any plane, just to get back to normality.

Nearly hit the ceiling when Gemmell scored then went berserk when   Chalmers got the winner. Went out to the pub right after the game but   could only find one Celtic fan (a lukewarm one at that). Nevertheless we   both kept singing Hail Hail, and chanting Celtic!...Celtic... just  like  our fans had been doing in the stadium in Lisbon. People were  looking  at us and shaking their heads. Most of them didn&#39;t have a clue  what we  were celebrating, but 3 or 4 came over to congratulate us  saying Celtic  were fantastic.

It&#39;s for posterity! :lol:<br><br>From  the moment Bobby Lennox scored the goal that won the league at  Motherwell to give us the first title in my Celtic-supporting lifetime  (in 1954 I was a Cavan fan like my Dad :rolleyes: ) I knew we were going  to win the European Cup. I was never as certain of anything in my life.  I told everyone who would listen, including the rake of huns who worked  on the sportsdesk of the paper on which I was working. I was all of 21  years old, full of piss and vinegar.<br><br>We drew Zurich, the Swiss  champions, in the first round. Excellent! Piece of toffee. We&#39;ll  slaughter them. Hmm! Not quite. I was planning to go with my mates when  the sports editor asked me if I would do 200 words for the Irish News in  Belfast, for whom he stringed. I had my own ideas as to why he didn&#39;t  want to see Celtic&#39;s first game in the European Cup. :lol: So there I  was in the press box above the old stand roof for the start of the  wonderful adventure. Well, for the first half, all my pervious bravado  was just a puff of smoke. Zurich were tough -- in every sense. Big and  strong and athletic, they put us to the pin of our collars. I was  delighted to see halftime.<br><br>Second half, different story: Celtic  gained the upper hand when, from almost below where I was sitting, Tommy  Gemmell moved on to the ball and from 35 yards nearly burst the net.  That&#39;s how I saw it anyway. I&#39;m picturing it as I write. We scored again  and won 2-0, but it had been tough and a lot of scribes fancied us to  be turfed out on our jacksies in the second leg. The one who actually  wrote that we would, Alec Young of the Daily Mail, was written off by  Big Jock, who never let him forget it. The Big Man knew exactly how to  play the second leg and we cantered it 0-3. I was with my mates in a  city centre pub when the news came in with the first editions. Bedlam!<br><br>Second  round, seen from the Jungle, was straightforward -- 3-1 home and away  against Nantes -- and then the quarters against Vojvodina. The Yugoslavs  were known as the Brazilians of Europe in those days and they were a  good team with some terrific players. We lost 1-0 over there and then,  on the Saturday, I got appendicitis and was whipped into the Southern  General to be operated on that night. My mood wasn&#39;t improved by hearing  that we&#39;d drawn 1-1 at Stirling that afternoon. My only worry was would  I make the second leg. I was released on the morning of the game 10  days later and drove my mother crazy by insisting on going. My mates  said they&#39;d look after me. :lol: We watched a ferocious game of football  that ebbed back and forth and were one up going into injury time.<br><br>Well,  you know what happened! Another brilliant corner from the massively  underrated Charlie Gallagher, and there was Cesar to bullet an  unstoppable header into the net. The Yugoslavs collapsed on the turf as  we went mental, me holding my side for fear the stitches would burst.  :clap:<br><br>The semis were tough too -- Dukla were good -- but a  brilliant double from Wispy aided by the cheekiest bit of play by Bertie  Auld put us in the driving seat. I was working for the second leg and  didn&#39;t see it but just waiting for news -- any news -- made it the  longest 90 minutes of my life. And then we were there. :worthy:<br><br>There  was no question of me not going. Incredibly, only one of my mates, Pat,  said he was going too. :rubeyes: So we decided to hitchhike. We left  from a pub in Govan where the Irish chargehand, Barney, had a whip round  for the pair of us that almost doubled our &pound;20 each of travelling and  spending money. What a man. :worthy: Fecked if we were going to  hitchhike to London now. We raced for the 10.30 London bus from Buchanan  Street with our newfound wealth and began the journey in comfort. Train  from Euston (IIRC) to Dover, ferry across to Calais, and we walked  towards the road south.<br><br>The first thing I saw was a crowd of  about 30 lhads from Belfast who honestly were waiting for a lift that  would take them all. :lol: There were hundreds of Celtic fans streaming  along looking for a lift. I said to Pat: &#39;&#39;Sorry, old pal, we&#39;re going  to have to split up.&#39;&#39; He nearly soiled himself but agreed, so we split  up. I got three lifts rapid and arrived in Paris at about 10pm. The  driver had picked up a guy in a kilt but when I was talking to him he  seemed a bit non-committal. He was from Kirkcaldy but, though he was  wearing a Celtic scarf, it turned out he was a Raith fan. WTF! Don&#39;t you  just love gloryhunters, especially ones in kilts? :suspect:<br><br>Anyway,  he was a decent guy and we got a bus to a big road south, the biggest  road I&#39;d ever seen. It turned out there was another, even bigger road on  the other side that headed south so we had to run across the first  road. It was a motorway, the first one I&#39;d ever seen. If you&#39;ve ever  seen Eddie Murphy in Bowfinger, THAT&#39;S what it was like. The cacaphony  of horns still rings in my ears! :lol:<br><br>We split up and I made it  to the Portuguese border with a succession of lifts from some great  people, one of whom, an Algerian, spent the journey telling me what a  great man Eamon de Valera was. I agreed, of course! Each of the lifts  was an adventure in itself but that&#39;s for a longer book! I was picked up  by four guys from Glasgow at a Spanish-Portuguese border crossing  called Fuentes de Ohora and we drove to Fatima, then Coimbre, then into  Lisbon on Wednesday afternoon. We all went to Mass on the Thursday  morning (&#39;&#39;cannae be too carefull&#39;&#39; said Jimmy!) and then headed for the  match with my stomach in a knot.<br><br>Walking round the back of the  goal on entering the ground, I heard this roar, &#39;&#39;Hey Torq, eff me, you  made it!&#39;&#39; It was my best mate&#39;s big brother Joe, who had flown out on  BEA, for whom he worked. He told me he had seen Pat so I was doubly  delighted. I walked to my seat and there was Pat. Big hugs and the first  tears of the day!<br><br>Well. you all know the match backwards so I  won&#39;t go over that again, save to say that it was the greatest  experience of my non-family life, though Celtic IS part of my family.  After the game, the team bus passed our bus and I saw Joe McBride (poor  Joe :cry: ) holding the cup to the window as proudly as if he&#39;d scored  the winning goal himself. Lisbon was bedlam -- I&#39;ve never seen anything  like it. I left Joe and Pat about 11pm to get back to the caravan park  where we were staying -- the four boys had said I could go back with  them. I only heard later that Joe had fallen asleep and had his shoes  stolen :lol: and Pat had been told to head for the airport, even though  he didn&#39;t have an air ticket. He was flung on a plane and was back in  Glasgow before I awoke the following morning! :lol: :worthy:<br><br>It  was early Monday morning before I got home, running the gauntlet of  congratulating Spaniards and Frenchmen and not a few Englishmen, to be  fair. The number of English people on the ferry who went out of their  way to say &#39;&#39;well done&#39;&#39; was amazing. I already knew about the  celebrations in Glasgow and even in Belfast, having read about them in  all of the French papers. I was sorry I missed all that but, d&#39;you  what?. I wouldn&#39;t have missed a minute of what I experienced. :clap:<br> <br> <b>(Torquemada,  of KDS Forum, <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8517817/2/?x=50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2011</a>)<br> </b> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>       Happy Lisbon day!</h3><br>By: Phil Mac Giolla Bhain (published May 25th, 2012 at 10:48 am)<br><br>This day 45 years ago I was a seriously happy nine year old Bhoy.<br><br>I was recently asked to ransack my memories of the 25th May 1967 by Paul Larkin.<br><br>He asked people to relate their favourite Celtic goal and what it meant to them.<br><br>When you&rsquo;re asked to do this by the &ldquo;Green &amp; White Writer&rdquo; you have to step up.<br><br>http://www.lulu.com/shop/paul-larkin/poles-n-goals-and-hesselink/paperback/product-20036104.html<br><br>Here are my memories of that day in May 1967 that form a part of Paul&rsquo;s book:<br><br><br><br>It was decades after I witnessed that goal that it was explained to me what I had done with it for all the years since it had been scored.<br><br>Anytime the Lisbon Lions were mentioned I was, once again, a nine year old Bhoy standing right in front of the small black and white telly in our house in Baillieston.<br><br>I can see the little round table that had been pressed into service to hold the telly when it was brought into the house.<br><br>My grandmother fussed about whether or not to leave her doily on the table.<br><br>My mother, ever the worrier, had warned that the telly would make the thing go on fire.<br><br>This all sounded incredibly exciting and I would be able to help as I had a fireman&rsquo;s outfit of my own.<br><br>You only see good outcomes from stuff like this when you&rsquo;re nine.<br><br>After my grandfather had lifted and laid the telly several times to order my mammy&rsquo;s mammy finally stated that she would find a good home for the fine lace matt.<br><br>He harrumphed his displeasure as the woman of his life had finally made her mind up.<br><br>It was just as well his wagon building job gave him arms like Popeye.<br><br>At each side of the fire place there were large alcoves.<br><br>The telly sat on its wee table underneath the one of these built in recesses.<br><br>The wee TV was under the one that was home to a beautiful statue of the some saint or other.<br><br>I think this might have been the first live game I had ever watched by way of Logie Baird&rsquo;s invention.<br><br>This was probably the third Celtic goal I had ever seen on the telly.<br><br>The first one I remember was a shot from the edge of the box by Joe McBride in a league game, the second was Tam Gemmell&rsquo;s &ldquo;terrible dunt&rdquo; to level the score in Lisbon, but the one I captured and kept that day was, for me, the most important in Celtic&rsquo;s history.<br><br>There was ample evidence that day, even for a nine year old, that Giuliano Sarti was some kind of a superman.<br><br>He seemed capable of feats of agility that I had only seen attributed to Spiderman in my super hero comics.<br><br>The Italian in black truly was a marvel.<br><br>Playing the game of his life Sarti seemed unbeatable.<br><br>Even after Gemmell&rsquo;s equaliser the Inter goalie continued to leap across his goal and deny Celtic the lead.<br><br>With a few minutes to go it was pure, beautiful, inventive football that had the ball stabbed past Sarti for the second time that day in May.<br><br>Everything about that goal epitomised the way that Stein wanted his Lions to play.<br><br>A left back feinting and twisting inside the penalty box being double marked and then slipping it to the edge of the area.

The changing room hubbub suddenly stilled as Bill Shankly  advanced towards Jock Stein and in that unique rasping voice boomed:  &ldquo;John, you&#39;re immortal&rdquo;. Typically, he never referred to Stein as  &#39;Jock&#39;, but always by the name his family used for him.</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>It was a  unique tribute from the manger of Liverpool to the Celtic boss in the  wake of the Parkhead side&#39;s triumph when they became the first British  side, and non-Latin team, to lift the European Cup after their 2-1  victory against the might of Inter Milan and for me still the fixture  that is still my personal highlight from more than half a century&#39;s  football reporting.</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>Shankly was the only manager from outside  Scotland who made the journey to Portugal to watch Celtic out-master the  Italian masters that Thursday in May 1967 in Lisbon. His reward was to  make sure he was more than a footnote to that incredible occasion.</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>He  shrewdly highlighted before the game the similarities in attitude  between Stein and the Inter coach Helenio Herrera: &ldquo;They both hate  losing. After we beat Inter at Anfield in 1965 Herrera wouldn&#39;t speak to  me and when we defeated Celtic in the Cup-Winners Cup semi-final Stein  was raging as he left the pitch.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>The whole scenario I witnessed  is a lost age of football. The dressing-rooms in the antiquated Nacional  Stadium in Lisbon were cottages at one end of the ground, the security  leaked like a sieve so that journalists like myself could gain entry  without much trouble.</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br> </font></font></div>  <div><font size="3"><br></font> </div>   <div><font size="3">No chance today of any reporter getting  anywhere near as close to the after-match action, or the press party  being housed in the same hotel as the team &ndash; the old-fashioned charm of  the Palacio in the resort of Estoril. Sadly, in the increasingly bitter  Old Firm rivalry, little chance either of a repeat of the tribute  Rangers manager Scot Symon paid to his city opponents.</font><font size="3"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font>The  respected Symon told the Italian sports journal Tuttosport that he  forecast a 3-1 win for the Parkhead side and stated: &ldquo;I will be a Celtic  fan on Thursday.

Similarly, he took us to the foot  of the tunnel and recalled the tale of how Bertie Auld had burst into  the &lsquo;Celtic Song&rsquo; as the Glasgow side, the famous Lisbon Lions as they  would become, lined up alongside the immaculate giants of Inter Milan  and the team who were stick-on favourites to win the trophy.<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></font>Billy  walked us on to the pitch and kicked every ball in what was a frantic  game of football where Celtic had fallen behind through an early  penalty.<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></font>From there he told the story of how he and  assistant manager, Sean Fallon, had to go alone to collect the &lsquo;cup with  the big ears&rsquo;, as fellow Lion John Clark calls it, such was the mayhem  on the pitch at the final whistle.<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></font>Together we walked  up the 100 or so stairs to where the cup was lifted and through Billy&rsquo;s  description I felt as if I was seeing it for the second time, not the  first, despite the fact I wasn&rsquo;t born until 15 days after Celtic&rsquo;s  greatest achievement.<font size="2"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> </font></font>There is one thing that stands  out from those two days with Billy in Portugal; one thing above  everything else.

To his right is a table covered with photographs, testaments to a life fully lived. Most are of his sons and daughters, two of each, squirming in school uniforms or smiling under mortar boards: his own little dynasty.<br><br>Laid out on the desk in front of him are trophies of another kind: souvenirs from his trip to Lisbon to see his club win the European Cup in May, 1967. He has already shown me his passport, a pocket diary and a handful of hazy pictures from an Instamatic camera, the clearest of which shows four gallus teenagers on a dusty back road in France. <br><br>But now Sweeney is beckoning me closer to look at a small white box. With due reverence, he opens it to reveal&hellip; what? Shreds of tobacco, perhaps, or wood shavings from the Cross? Neither. But this is as close to a Holy Relic as Sweeney is ever likely to possess: a few desiccated blades of grass from the Est&aacute;dio Nacional; a piece of the very pitch where Tommy Gemmell and Stevie Chalmers&rsquo; goals secured their own immortality. <br><br>Sweeney &ndash; a dapper gent, with white, fly-away hair &ndash; was one of 10,000-plus fans who travelled to see 11 players from the still mean streets triumph over legends Inter Milan 50 years ago next month. From the Gallowgate, from the Gorbals, from Govanhill, from Garngad they came &ndash; hard-working labourers and Barrowland bovver boys alike &ndash; having scraped together enough money for the ticket and the journey, and precious little else. Some travelled by plane or train or in the &ldquo;Celticade&rdquo; led by Evening Times reporter John Quinn in his Hillman Imp. Others, including Sweeney, hitchhiked.<br><br>To those of us raised in the era of the replica strip, they look a stiff bunch, these men who refused to surrender their winter clothes to the threat of sunshine. But, off, off, off to the Continent seven years before Y Viva Espa&ntilde;a heralded a British invasion, they were champions of the charter flight, pioneers of the package holiday. And their respectable facades masked an inner recklessness. For they went on to have the wildest of times. They ran jubilant on to the pitch, they partied in the streets, they spent all their escudos and threw themselves on the mercy of the British embassy. And they returned home with a panoply of stories, which they burnished and embellished and showed off like war medals for half a century. <br><br>Stories, Sweeney has a few. Aged just 17, and with &pound;12 in his pocket, he and a friend thumbed lifts from Glasgow to Dover, took the ferry across the Channel, then walked the 20 miles from Calais to Boulogne, hooking up with two more pals along the way. At Boulogne, they caught up with the Celticade, inveigling their way into the back seats of cars. They made it to Lisbon in plenty of time, sleeping in a doorway the night before the game. And what a game it was. Sweeney recalls the surge of adrenaline as Gemmell knocked the ball into the back of the net for the equaliser, the chaos after the final whistle and the moment Billy McNeill lifted the trophy: a Greek god atop a stately amphitheatre.<br><br>But his best anecdotes, the ones he tells with greatest gusto, don&rsquo;t involve the match at all. There&rsquo;s the one about setting off from his Govanhill flat at 8pm, and making for a haulage company where, rumour had it, a truck driver called Archie would be willing to take them as far as London. &ldquo;We arrived, our Celtic scarves wrapped round our necks, and we waited and waited,&rdquo; Sweeney laughs. &ldquo;Finally, Archie turned up. &lsquo;These boys are wanting a lift to London,&rsquo; says one of the workers. Well, Archie took one look at what we were wearing and said: &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll be f***ing right.&rsquo; That was when we realised Archie was a Rangers fan.&rdquo; Somehow, Sweeney and his friend made it out to the A74. But it took them many rides and 22 hours to reach the capital.<br><br>Then, there is the story of the impounded passport. After the game, Sweeney and his friends ran out of money so &ndash; along with hundreds of others &ndash; they pitched up at the embassy looking for a sub. It was mayhem. &ldquo;There were Scots in sleeping bags all up the marble staircase and some guys frying sausages on a stove in the foyer,&rdquo; he says. They were given &pound;5 each, which &ndash; naturally &ndash; they spent on a trip to Estoril, the up-market resort where the team were staying. They tried to peek through the windows at the players, then lay on the beach where they all got burned. Sweeney had blisters all over his body. Out of cash again, they trooped back to the Embassy, where he promptly collapsed. Taken to the British Hospital, he was doused head-to-toe in Calamine lotion.<br><br>Finally, officials agreed to fund their journey home, but, wise to their spendthrift ways, they refused to give them the cash, insisting they turn up at the station the following morning. &ldquo;This woman met us &ndash; I think it was 8am &ndash; handed over tickets and packed lunches and sent us on our way. That was us, through Portugal, Spain, France, England and back to Glasgow. I felt terrible, and we had to hand in our passports at Dover, but it was worth it.&rdquo;<br><br>As the 50th anniversary approaches, and Celtic prepares for a week of celebrations, there are those who wish these stories would dry up now. They are tired of old-timers going on about how they sold their house to fund the trip, and the way the Lisbon Lions mythology has come to dominate Scottish footballing history. Feyenoord &ndash; perpetual underdogs to Ajax &ndash; beat Celtic in the European Cup three years later, and yet, in its stadium museum in Rotterdam, the victory merits only a fleeting mention. So why does 25 May, 1967 continue to wield such a powerful grip on the Glasgow psyche?<br><br>Some memorabilia from Dom&#39;s trip to Lisbon. Picture: John Devlin Sweeney has another story which may shed some light. It goes like this. Not all the turf he brought back from the Est&aacute;dio Nacional is still in the little white box. A devotee of JFK &ndash; whose photograph once graced the walls of the Celtic boardroom &ndash; he swapped a few blades for a tiny bit of the grassy knoll brought back by an acquaintance from Dallas, Texas.<br><br>This exchange marked a literal and symbolic mingling of two seminal moments in the history of Irish Catholic identity. Seven years after Kennedy&rsquo;s election helped validate Irish Catholics in the US, their counterparts in Glasgow were still struggling for recognition. Discrimination was rife; whole industries were out of bounds. The fans who travelled to Lisbon knew what it meant to be asked what school they attended. And that discrimination extended to football. &ldquo;A Catholic could be the best goal scorer in the land, but they&rsquo;d never play for Rangers,&rdquo; says one fan. &ldquo;It was hard to shake off a sense of injustice.&rdquo;<br><br>You didn&rsquo;t have to be Catholic to be involved with Celtic &ndash; Jock Stein was, famously, a Protestant &ndash; but the extent to which club and faith were intertwined could be seen by the splashes of green and white that brightened up churches in Lisbon on the morning of the match, which was also the Feast of Corpus Christi, and in the number of Glasgow priests who said an extra prayer for an incorruptible and keen-sighted referee.<br><br>Seeing the club &ndash; whose players lived in the same tenements in the same streets as their supporters &ndash; prove themselves in Europe was more than just an excuse for a party, it was a much-needed injection of self-confidence. Is it too fanciful to imagine it helped propel a generation on to success? Because, against all the odds, many Glasgow-based Irish Catholics born in the 60s or early 70s reached the tops of their professions. Some like Sweeney &ndash; aka Mr Artex &ndash; built up businesses from scratch; others went on to storm the Protestant citadels of finance, law and medicine.<br><br>Many cultural shifts contributed to this phenomenon. There was the disintegration of the old industries, the introduction of comprehensive education, and the chippy determination that comes from being continually put down. But Celtic&rsquo;s European success is somewhere in the mix. <br><br>&ldquo;When you talk about 1967, you are talking about a time when [Irish Catholics] didn&rsquo;t feel accepted by mainstream Scotland, so this victory is not just a sporting victory, it&rsquo;s a victory for a community, which rightly or wrongly felt themselves to be oppressed,&rdquo; says historian Professor Sir Tom Devine. &ldquo;The pride was incredible and it did represent a phase in emancipation. It wasn&rsquo;t the only factor &ndash; the educational ones were much more potent &ndash; but in terms of signal events, the Lisbon Lions victory probably stands alongside the visit of Pope John Paul II in 1982.&rdquo;<br><br>One family caught up in the swirl of social change were the Cowan brothers: Jimmy, 74, John, 69, and Gordon, 63, whose disparate lives are fused together by a passion for their team and the shared memory of one fine day in the Portuguese capital.<br><br>At his home near Queen&rsquo;s Park, Gordon is sifting through a mound of keepsakes &ndash; tickets, programmes, newspaper cuttings &ndash; to find a photograph taken on the way to the game. It shows the brothers, their father, also Jimmy, and two family friends, under the awning of what was then known as Abbotsinch Airport. Gordon, 13 has a cheeky grin on his face, and a hold-all containing a whole cooked chicken at his feet. Jimmy Snr is wearing a tie and holding a placard for Sarsfield Supporters Club. <br><br>Jimmy Snr was &ndash; the brothers agree &ndash; a larger than life character full of drive  and vision. He was the kind of man who, with the right education and opportunities, would have gone on to achieve great things; the kind of man who, on learning that Celtic had made it to the final, thought nothing of walking into a travel company and chartering a flight.<br><br>Though they must have recounted it 1,000 times, the brothers still sound awestruck by his daring. &ldquo;Other people were booking individual flights through holiday companies, but he believed he could fill a plane so he raised and paid the &pound;300 up front,&rdquo; says Gordon.<br><br>&ldquo;Remember, back then there were no mobile phones, no social media, so it was much more difficult to organise things. And many working class people had never been abroad. But our phone was ringing off the hook right up to the last minute, with people desperate to secure a place.&rdquo;<br><br>Jimmy, a fireman, was born in the Protestant stronghold of Bridgeton Cross but brought up his own family in the Gorbals. By 1967, the family had moved to a tied house in Pollokshields, but Jimmy continued to serve as bus convener for Sarsfield Supporters Club (now renamed Jimmy Cowan Evergreen in his honour).<br><br>His plan, though well laid, was not without its flaws. To the Cowans, the European Cup final was just another away game, so it seemed reasonable to catch a 9.30am flight for a 5.30pm kick-off. With hindsight, however, they were cutting things a bit fine.<br><br>At the airport, events careened out of control. &ldquo;At first the place was buzzing and everyone was buoyant,&rdquo; says Gordon. &ldquo;But it quickly became apparent there were delays. The guy my dad had been dealing with, a guy called Mr Bell, who looked like Leonard Rossiter, kept insisting everything would be OK, but our flight slipped further and further down the list.<br><br>&ldquo;In the end tensions were running so high, reporters were sent out. My dad was quoted in The Citizen. &lsquo;James Cowan, 56, flight controller,&rsquo; it [wrongly] called him. The article went on to describe the &lsquo;tremendous roar of relief&rsquo; when the flight was finally called. Aye, especially from the travel agent who thought he was going to be lynched.&rdquo;<br><br>Many people on board had never travelled by plane before. It is said some tried to prise open the windows so they could stick their scarves out; others had a whip-round for the pilot. By the time they touched down at Lisbon, however, it was already 5pm, and a full-blown rammy seemed inevitable.<br><br>The air stewardesses opened the doors, ushering in a blast of hot air, but the steps were still in the process of being wheeled over. &ldquo;I remember this guy with short sleeves and sunglasses looking up at us with a ma&ntilde;ana, ma&ntilde;ana expression,&rdquo; says Gordon. &ldquo; So Jimmy, John and a couple of others decided to take matters into their own hands. They jumped, or rather dreeped, out of the plane and on to the tarmac. People ask us: &lsquo; How come they didn&rsquo;t break a leg or ankle?&rsquo; But they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;<br><br>Once the steps were locked in place, the other passengers followed, forcing their way past all barriers. &ldquo;An officious security guard or policeman had shut the door to arrivals, but one guy shouted &lsquo;stand back Big Man or ye&rsquo;ll get malkied,&rsquo; and he must have realised there was no way he could keep everyone calm, so he opened it.&rdquo; The fans pushed through &ndash; Jimmy Snr still keeping a close eye on Gordon &ndash; and raced to find cabs. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it was a nervous release of energy, but when we got into the taxi we were in stitches.&rdquo;<br><br>By the time they reached the stadium, the first goal had already been scored. &ldquo;There were travellers sitting on the grass outside; a woman said &lsquo;1-0 to Inter&rsquo; and my heart just sank, because in those days the team had perfected this defensive system called &lsquo;catenaccio&rsquo;, and when they scored, you might as well go home.&rdquo;<br><br>Thankfully, though, Celtic&rsquo;s attacking style won the day and many a macho west of Scotland heart combusted. &ldquo;My dad was crying and he turned round and gave me a hug,&rdquo; says Gordon. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ever remember him doing that before.&rdquo;<br><br>Fifty years on, much has changed for the Cowans. Jimmy Snr is long gone. But he lives on through his three sons who remember the important things: the way he always thought bigger than everyone else; the way he stood against sectarianism; the way he took time out in Lisbon to buy a charm (a tiny gold ship from the city&rsquo;s Coat of Arms) for his wife&rsquo;s bracelet. The day he died, in December, 1997, the whole family had been due to watch Celtic play Hearts at Parkhead. Shellshocked, Jimmy, John and Gordon went anyway; they didn&rsquo;t know what else to do.<br><br>Their father would surely be proud of what they have made of their lives. Now retired, Jimmy Jnr spent more than 30 years working for the Inland Revenue, while Gordon forged a career in life assurance. As for John, he was one of the first Glasgow-based Irish Catholics to scale the heights of the finance industry. He joined Scottish Amicable &ndash; where he was given a bowler hat and a Triumph Herald car &ndash; and eventually became a director. Today, he is the chairman of three companies and owns a &pound;3.5m flat in Mayfair. <br><br>When the brothers returned to Lisbon, along with John&rsquo;s son Christopher, to see Celtic play Benfica in 2012, they did so as &ldquo;nice middle-class boys who could afford to stay in hotels&rdquo;. But they haven&rsquo;t forgotten where they came from. &ldquo;People look down on the fact you grew up in the Gorbals, but I have always been proud of it,&rdquo; says John. &ldquo;Living in such a diverse community, amongst Poles, Lithuanians, Italians and Jews, was an enriching experience.&rdquo;<br><br>It is 11am on 11 March, 2017, the day of the Old Firm match at Celtic Park. Jimmy, John and Gordon are standing beneath Billy McNeill&rsquo;s statue, talking about you know what. Behind them, gulls swoop theatrically over the metal gridwork of the Lisbon Lions stand and fans cluster round the floral tribute to Gemmell, whose funeral took place a few days earlier.<br><br>They are fading out, the men who took the club to glory. Ronnie Simpson, Bobby Murdoch, Jimmy Johnstone and Gemmell now play on Elysian Fields. McNeill has dementia. No-one knows if he remembers how it felt to raise the Cup before an adoring crowd.<br><br>The legacy they leave is mixed. Their success is a source of enduring joy, of course, and collateral against future losses. But some believe the relentless focus on their legend has been a burden on later players, who could never hope to rival their achievements, and on supporters, who can only ever experience the elation of &rsquo;67 vicariously through the moist-eyed reminiscences of their fathers.<br><br>Even were the club to triumph in Europe again, the pride would be less personal. Today&rsquo;s star players, most of them brought in from abroad, do not &ndash; cannot &ndash; belong to the community in the way the Lisbon Lions did.

Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t remember the names, but they had wide players in defence and midfield who were exceptional.<br><br>&ldquo;We were really sad after the game as we understood that we had come to the end of an era.

I never heard from her.&quot; On that 4,000 mile trek, two happy endings was too much to hope for.<br><br>One was enough, more than enough. In this film, you marvel anew not just at what the Lions achieved, not just the lengths that 10,000 Celtic people went to in order to see them achieve it, but how powerful that achievement remains to this day, the magnitude of it passed on from father to son through the generations.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Last Car Into Lisbon</h3>2017<br>http://www.bytheminute.co/events/5232-football-the-last-car-into-lisbon-50-years-on-from-the-lisbon-lions-one-fan-tells-his-tale-of-an-extraordinary-journey-live-21-may-2017<br><br>This story is penned by Charlie Fryars who has kindly allowed us to publish this extraordinary tale...A few days before the big final I got a phone call from my pal Gerry Loney. He was going to Lisbon in a car with three other guys. There was a space. Did I want to go? Of course I wanted to go like almost every other Celtic supporter. But there were practical problems. <br>Would I get leave at such short notice? I didn&rsquo;t have a passport, but in those days you could get a Visitors Passport at the labour exchange (honest, I kid you not) which lasted a year. It was issued over the counter. I knew someone, a Tim, who worked at the Parkhead &lsquo;buroo.&rsquo; I phoned him and he offered to stay on late that day if I got there with my photo, which I duly did from a booth.<br>My boss was a Rangers supporter, but he let me have the leave and wished me well. After all Rangers were in the final of the Cup Winners cup and the so-called great Glasgow double was on the cards. <br>That night, feverish with excitement I phoned Gerry. There was one nagging doubt however. We weren&rsquo;t leaving until the Monday evening. I expressed my concern. Three days to get to Lisbon from Glasgow? No problem, he reassured me; there would be plenty of time. Surprisingly, I never asked why we couldn&rsquo;t leave at the weekend, but I wasn&rsquo;t organising the trip, so I let it pass.<br>Monday came. I left work with colleagues&rsquo; good wishes ringing in my ears, although with a suspicion that a few of them didn&rsquo;t really mean it. Along with a host of well wishers we met in &lsquo;The Admiral&rsquo; in Waterloo Street. <br>I was introduced to my fellow travellers, whom apart from Gerry, I had never met before. They were Laurence Donnelly, John Hughes and Jim McDaid. We had only two drivers, and I wasn&rsquo;t one of them. A couple of my friends raised doubts, about our timetable and relying on two drivers for what was not much short of a 4,000 mile round trip. It was going to be a hard slog for them, they surmised.<br>We set off around six o&rsquo;clock. I felt like we were competing in the Monte Carlo Rally as everyone poured into the street to wave us off.The car was an Austin Cambridge, from the British Leyland stable, not known for the last word in reliability. <br>It was a big car, probably the equivalent of today&rsquo;s Mondeo. Both sides of the car had &lsquo;CELTIC&rsquo; spelled in large letters with green sticky tape. We also had a banner with two poles which stretched the width of the car. Two of us held it tightly through the back window as we sped off. It was to make many appearances throughout the journey.<br>Unfortunately, time has erased the memory of what was on it. As an aside, unbelievably none of us had brought a camera and there was never a pictorial record of our epic trek. It is also perhaps worth a note (gasp) that neither were there mobile phones nor GPS in 1967.<br>Three of us fitted in the back seat OK, but with hardly an ocean of space between us. We had no plans to stop for overnight accommodation. In fact the schedule meant that we would have to drive much of the three nights before reaching Lisbon.<br>It was comfortable enough as we headed along London Road and past Celtic Park with a loud toot of the horn, but being in the back seat trying to sleep for three consecutive nights was going to be a challenge.We were heading for Southampton and a morning ferry to Cherbourg. Four hundred odd miles in thirteen or so hours looked perfectly manageable and we settled down for a long night.<br>We broke down near Lockerbie!End of a dream we thought. We had no leeway with regards to time and if the fault couldn&rsquo;t be fixed soon we were snookered. The thought of not getting to the game was bad enough; worse was the vision of sneaking home only hours after leaving.<br>Fortunately, we had AA 5 star insurance. A roadside phone was found and a local garage was summoned, although it took them over an hour to arrive. I can&rsquo;t remember now what the actual fault was. I just recall the engine cutting out. To our great delight it was a simple electrical fault, a loose connection somewhere, I think.<br>We were off again 90 minutes or so after stopping. We drove all night with only a couple of brief breaks, and the three in the back began to realise how uncomfortable the experience was going to be. The front passenger seat was reserved for the driver not at the wheel, to stretch out and try to get some kip. The rest of us were too excited to sleep.<br>We reached the ferry terminal with minutes to spare, the ship&rsquo;s crew astounded we had left it so late. There was only one other party heading for Lisbon. It was two couples, two Celtic and two Rangers supporters. After Lisbon they were driving up to Nuremberg for the Rangers final. After we disembarked we never saw them again and did not know if they made it. <br>A four hour or so crossing gave us the chance to lie down and catch up on sleep, and then off at Cherbourg and on the road again, the excitement heightened by being in France. At Cherbourg the banner came out again. We drove through the city streets getting many puzzled looks, but some waves and thumbs up from several people who knew where we were going.<br>We drove down the Cotentin peninsula. I don&rsquo;t remember much about that day, as I probably slept through most of it. We did stop at a cliff top near Granville and had a game of football, getting the odd toot from a passing vehicle. Later, we realised, that was precious time wasted.<br>Come night-time and the drivers declared that they had to sleep. They were knackered. We were near Nantes and drove into the centre (remember Celtic put Nantes out in an earlier round) and parked at the station.<br>Us non-drivers vacated the car to give the other two space to sleep and went into the station buffet. The opportunity for a few beers was enticing and we settled down for a few hours. The waitress was an attractive young lady called Ghislaine, and I tried to converse with her in my schoolboy French. <br>The bar had only another few customers and after they ascertained who we were and where we were going they went back to their drinks. My two companions, after a couple of beers, started nodding off, taking advantage of the long seats.<br>I fell in love with Ghislaine straight away as we started up a faltering conversation, her English being less than my French, but we got on like a house on fire. She was fascinated by our journey and I waxed lyrical about Celtic, although she had never heard of them and didn&rsquo;t know they had played in Nantes. <br>Nowadays the bar would have been full of Tims before and after the game, but in the sixties few fans travelled away on European nights. That, of course changed in May 1967!Ghislaine tried to coax my Celtic scarf from me, but I wasn&rsquo;t parting with it. I wanted it to be in Lisbon with me. However, I promised to come in on the way home, give it to her, and probably ask her to marry me. <br>The buffet closed at 2AM. Ghislaine, to my delight, flung her arms round me, slapped a kiss on my cheek and bid us bon voyage. Even more in love, I returned to the car with the others. Several times during the journey I was told emphatically to shut about my new love.<br>The drivers were asleep and we were loath to waken them. Fuelled by drink we drifted off to sleep. I was first awake at just after 7 o&rsquo;clock. After finding a discreet spot to get rid of the beer, I wakened everybody. We had planned to leave Nantes much earlier, and a sense of disquiet crept over us. By our calculation we still had about a thousand miles to go; in about 33 hours. <br>On paper it looked easy &ndash; an average of just over 30 miles an hour. But we had to stop to eat, have toilet breaks and it would be impossible to drive non-stop for that amount of time. The drivers felt refreshed, however, after their sleep and we vowed to press on, come what may. By 7.30 we were on the road again.<br>It was going well as the miles flew past. But it was too good to last. Suddenly a roar came from the back of the car. On inspection it looked as though the exhaust had parted from the silencer. We drove on a bit to test it, but we knew we couldn&rsquo;t drive to Lisbon with that amount of noise coming from the car. Once more it looked as though our trip was doomed.<br>There was a handbook in the car which listed British Leyland dealerships. Incredibly, there was one in La Rochelle, not too far way; not on our route, but not far off it. But did they have an exhaust in stock? <br>We headed into the city stopping frequently to get half-understood directions. Finally we reached the dealer. They had the right exhaust, it was fitted promptly and we were on our way again with Gallic good wishes ringing in our ears, probably mixed with incredulity at our venture.<br>The diversion to La Rochelle, finding the correct address, having the exhaust fitted and getting on the correct route again had cost us about two hours. But we were still hopeful as we headed south towards Bordeaux. The traffic was heavy, but soon we were beyond Bordeaux, heading towards Biarritz and the Spanish border. We allowed ourselves an hour break to eat and freshen up a bit. <br>This was before Spain joined the then Common Market and there were full passport controls at the border. It was early evening (Wednesday) and a long queue on the French side. The banner appeared again, and with the tape at the side we were a bit of a spectacle as fingers were pointed and smiles and thumbs-up given. <br>It looked like another hold-up to cross the border, but suddenly a Guardia Civil officer appeared at the car. With an incredulous &lsquo;ustedes son muy tardes&rsquo; he waved us out of the queue and walked beside us up to the top where we were waved through with a quick passport check, big smiles and cries of &lsquo;buen viaje.&rsquo; We assumed that many more Tims had preceded us.<br>We had about 700 miles to go and less than 24 hours in which to do it. The game started at 5PM, so we didn&rsquo;t have the luxury of a 7.45 kick-off to aid us. At around eight o&rsquo;clock we stopped in a small town between San Sebastian and Burgos and entered a bar for food and drink and life-inducing coffee for the drivers. <br>We had a pow-wow. We had driven around 500 miles since Nantes. The drivers were becoming exhausted again, and even with sharing the driving neither of them had slept during the day. We talked, we argued. Do we call it a day? Will we just stay in Spain and watch the game on TV, book into a hotel and get some proper rest, and, almost as importantly, a shower? <br>We had stripped to the waist in a cafe toilet in France for a wash and changed our shirts, but we felt far from clean. To my shame I was coming round to thinking of giving up. <br>Incidentally, that night Spain were playing England in a friendly and the bar was full. There was a priest there and I spoke to him as the only one with any Spanish and told him of our predicament. I can&rsquo;t remember his exact reply, but it amounted to &lsquo;go for it.&rsquo; My friend Gerry was adamant that he would not countenance giving up after all we had been through and we decided to press on.<br>The priest gave us and the car a blessing (it needed one), and most of the bar customers piled out into the street to wave us off as we piled back into the car, our minds made up. We drove all night, passing Burgos, Valladolid and Salamanca. <br>I had a special interest in Valladolid as my father&rsquo;s cousin, Monsignor Philip Flanagan had been the rector of the Scots seminar there, but of course we had no time to stop and sight-see. The non drivers talked all the time, telling jokes and ghost stories to keep the current driver awake as the other one tried to sleep. It was a beautiful night, the roads were empty and at one point we came across a Spanish army column marching in formation. We stopped, and so did they. We cried &lsquo;Celtic, Celtic&rsquo; at the top of our voices and waved our flags. <br>They in turn waved their rifles in the air and hollered back.We reached the Portuguese border beyond Ciudad Rodrigo and another potential disaster. Portugal was still a dictatorship and the border closed overnight. There was a small queue of vehicles waiting to cross. Then came pure farce. A couple of the Portuguese guards came up, looked in the car, and nodded &lsquo;Celtic, Lisboa.<br>I tried in Spanish to explain that we might miss the match. They nodded and stroked their chins. One of them smiled and did a little dance with his hands in the air. We finally got it. In the car were the two poles for the banner. We laid them cross-wise on the ground and four of us did the highland fling to the great delight of the guards and the onlookers.<br>I still have an overhead camera shot in my head, looking down on this madness at a border crossing at dawn. After much cheering and clapping they raised the barrier and let us through. I don&rsquo;t know if they took pity on the others, although it didn&rsquo;t occupy my thoughts much.<br>We raced on, fearful that we would miss the 5 o&rsquo;clock kick-off. I remember the snaking drive through the mountains, women selling oranges at the side of the road, and a tragedy that we came across at one point in the late morning. There was a Hillman Imp, with its big end or something else knackered.<br>We stopped and spoke to the poor fellow in it. He had broken down the previous evening. He had been with three mates and they had all got lifts and deserted him. They had promised to phone his recovery company in the UK to get him rescued and he was still waiting for someone to arrive. We commiserated but had to leave him. I&rsquo;d love to know how he fared.<br>Finally, we reached the outskirts of Lisbon and met up with buses full of Tims coming from the airport. We felt like pioneers as they hung out the windows (yes they could do that) and waved and yelled at us. We had made it! But there was still a twist in the tail that many will find hard to believe.<br>As I said earlier, I had never met three of my fellow passengers before. They were nice guys. Two of them had trained for the priesthood, but had left and were still devout Catholics. That day was a holyday of obligation, either the Ascension or Corpus Christi, and they felt we should at least try to get to mass.<br>With the rest of us astounded, not to say raging, we traipsed around for about an hour that could have been spent soaking up the atmosphere at the stadium, looking for churches, but never found one with an ongoing mass. Finally, threats of real violence persuaded them to head for the stadium.<br>The rest, they say, is history. More eloquent writers than me have eulogised about that afternoon in the sun.Particular flashes of that day come back often &ndash; the sheer joy at winning, the guy in the green Glasgow Corporation transport uniform which a Portuguese next to us thought was him dressing for the game instead of finishing his shift and heading for the airport.<br>The police car racing past us after the game with its siren on and the driver wearing a Celtic scarf; the sheer mayhem after the game; the wild dancing up and down; and, oh aye, the two goals.<br>We ended up in a packed square in Lisbon that night in sheer celebration, and I&rsquo;m sure mingled with fans who said &lsquo;bugger, I&rsquo;m staying&rsquo; instead of catching their flight home, and I believe the queue at the British embassy the next morning testified to that.<br>Regretfully, we left Lisbon before dawn and started on the hard slog back home. To appease our two devout friends we went to Fatima later that morning to visit the shrine to the Virgin Mary. It didn&rsquo;t take us much off our route. It was then Friday morning in southern Portugal and we were booked on the ferry at Cherbourg for Sunday afternoon, so the driving would still be a hard slog.<br>We had been on our own on the outward journey, but were part of a cavalcade on the way back. Every bar, cafe and restaurant we stopped at was full of supporters. We were waved at in every town and village we passed through in Portugal, Spain and France. I remember having a pee in a restaurant in Spain and someone I knew came in. <br>We stood chatting for a minute and then parted as though we&rsquo;d been in a pub in Glasgow.As on the way down, we drove all night with short breaks Early on Saturday afternoon we reached Biarritz. We were filthy and unkempt as we gazed out on the town&rsquo;s wonderful beaches. Not hesitating, we ran on to the beach stripped to our underpants and ran into the warmish sea. <br>The feeling was sublime. We relaxed and dried off before setting off again.Just south of Bordeaux, in the early evening, the drivers had had enough. They had brought a two-man tent, which they hadn&rsquo;t had the opportunity to use. Erecting it at the side of the road, they got sleeping bags and retired, stating their intention to set an alarm for 2AM.<br>Setting off again I had a sudden realisation. We would be reaching Nantes at around 5AM. The station bar would be closed and I would not be having my tryst with Ghislaine. There was no point in asking the boys to wait there until it opened. <br>Back home I put my scarf in an envelope, addressed it to &lsquo;Ghislaine, Bar de la Gare, Nantes,&rsquo; accompanied by a letter in execrable French. I asked her to write and was already planning a return trip to France, but I never heard from her. Ah, well!<br>There was a big contingent of Tims on the ferry. A party was started and I think we drank the ship dry. Someone had a replica of the cup. He held it aloft and we did a conga round the decks to the delight of other passengers, who were mainly English and joined in the celebrations, gratefully accepting slugs from the bottles of duty free which were passed around.<br>We drove north for a while until we had to stop at a services to let the drivers sleep. Many people came up to us and congratulated us. Before we left the next morning, Monday, a driver in a car pulled up. He told us he had been on our ferry and joined in the fun. Disembarking, he realised he had drank and had to book into a hotel. <br>Our reception driving through England was also great, as people waved to us on the motorways and congratulated us at the services. At last, seven days later and seven nights sleeping in a car, tired and extremely grotty we arrived back in Glasgow to joyous greetings from some citizens and a different kind of greeting from others who seemed to be giving us a V for victory sign.<br>POSTSCRIPTOn January 3rd 1999, after seeing Celtic draw 2-2 at Ibrox (an honest mistake from referee McCluskey denying The Hoops a penalty; plus ca change) I set off on another European adventure. My wife and I had taken early retirement and we decided to have a couple of winter months in Benalmadena in Spain. My wife refused to fly and I decided I would drive. <br>As I planned the trip I realised that I could replicate a big chunk of the 1967 experience.We drove all night, got the same ferry crossing from Southampton to Cherbourg and drove down through France. The difference this time was that we had a night in a hotel near Nantes (no I didn&rsquo;t pay a pilgrimage to the station bar!), another at Bordeaux and then a short hop for a 3rd overnight in Biarritz<br>Down through Spain I parted company with the road to Lisbon at Burgos. We had another overnight south of Madrid after nearly having had a nervous breakdown on the ring road during rush hour. All through France and Spain the roads were vastly improved from 1967, most of the journey was on dual carriageways or motorways and we had to traverse very few towns. <br>The reason I am writing this is, even with four overnight rests, if for some reason I had had to turn around and do the return journey soon after arriving I would have freaked out. But that&rsquo;s exactly what our drivers, and many others no doubt, had to do and even after fifty years my admiration for them is immense. Of course they were young, but even at that it was a gargantuan feat.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Sir Alex Ferguson: Lisbon Lions triumph is &#39;the greatest feat in football&#39;</h3><br><a class="external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40053489" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40053489</a><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson has described the Lisbon Lions&#39; 1967 European Cup win as &quot;the greatest feat in football&quot;.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s 2-1 win over Internazionale 50 years ago established the team as &quot;pioneers of doing the impossible,&quot; Ferguson insisted.<br><br>&quot;They set the pattern for a period, particularly when Manchester United the next year did it,&quot; the Scot said.<br><br>&quot;From &#39;65 to &#39;67, if someone had written a book about it they would call it fiction. It was amazing.&quot;<br><br>Ferguson  was speaking at an event at Glasgow&#39;s SSE Hydro to celebrate the  achievement of Jock Stein&#39;s Celtic side on 25 May 1967.<br><br>The former Manchester United manager said the European Cup win paved the way for other British sides to follow.<br><br>&quot;They were [pioneers] for British football, there&#39;s no doubt about that,&quot; Ferguson said.<br><br>&quot;Sir  Matt [Busby] at Manchester United was rebuilding the team after the  Munich air disaster, but they got to a semi-final, which was a great  achievement for a very young side.<br><br>&quot;For Celtic to do it with 11  players from within 25 miles of each other is astonishing. This [event]  will recognise the achievement, but [also] applaud the players and  management staff who achieved it. It will never be done again.&quot;<br><br>Relive how Celtic won the European Cup<br><br>Ferguson  arrived in Glasgow after watching Manchester United&#39;s 2-0 win over Ajax  in Stockholm to win the Europa League. He said the victory &quot;gave the  city a lift&quot; after the bomb blast at the end of an Ariana Grande concert  at the Manchester Arena last Monday night that killed 22 people and  injured 116 more.<br><br>&quot;Manchester is a city like Glasgow, it&#39;s  working class, they&#39;ve got fantastic people there and they&#39;ll get  together,&quot; Ferguson added.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve been through some difficult  times in the past, the bombing in the Arndale Centre in 1996, they  recovered from that, and they will get together because they have the  working class ethic about them and there&#39;s a great unity now in the  city.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re all proud of the [United side], it was a great achievement.&quot;<br>Former Celtic captain Roy Aitken<br>Only three players have made more appearances for Celtic than former captain Roy Aitken<br><br>Former  Celtic captain Roy Aitken also attended the event at the Hydro, and he  talked of the Lisbon Lions setting the standards that others had to  follow at the club.<br><br>&quot;They&#39;ve been the benchmark for all the teams since 1967,&quot; Aitken said.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s  never going to be achieved again, it&#39;s iconic considering the group of  players who were there at that time. Celtic demand success and these  guys showed what it took to be winners, they were top quality and top  guys. Everything that you need in a footballer, they had.<br><br>&quot;When I  came into the team at 16, 17, I was from Ardrossan, Bobby [Lennox] was  from Saltcoats, he was my mentor throughout my early years. He showed  what it took to be a Celtic player and gave me the guidelines and tools  required.<br><br>&quot;I owe a lot to him and it&#39;s great to be here tonight  to celebrate with the fans and the team.

Not to mention how such glory inspired Ferguson to win trophies galore of his own in the years that followed.<br>Ferguson and Stein, two brilliant and remarkable Scotsmen, worked together for the national side &mdash; Stein as the studious manager, Ferguson as his fledgling No 2. You can hear the respect when Sir Alex recalls those days.<br>The former Manchester United boss was in Glasgow at the Celebrate &#39;67 event on Thursday<br>&lsquo;The great value was in the Saturday nights we met in the hotel at home or when we were abroad,&rsquo; says Ferguson of his duties as assistant to Stein during Scotland&rsquo;s qualifying campaign for the 1986 World Cup. &lsquo;It was fantastic. He was not a great sleeper so he would have you still up at three or four in the morning with (masseur) Jimmy Steele making pots of tea.<br>&lsquo;I would say to him, &ldquo;Jock, we need to get into our beds now. I am taking training in the morning&rdquo;. He would reply, &ldquo;You will be all right, son. You will get a sleep in the afternoon. Steely! Get another pot of tea on&rdquo;.<br>&lsquo;He was one of the greatest managers of all time. Without question. He did something that has not been done before and will not be done again. You cannot overstate that. This is what makes him unique.<br>&lsquo;It is what Alexander Fleming did when he discovered penicillin in a wee laboratory. It is what Alan Turing did when cracking the Enigma code. That is one standard of greatness and Jock met it.<br><br>+&lsquo;The Lisbon Lions were brought up within 30 miles of Celtic Park. That was never done before Jock. It will never be done again.&rsquo;<br>The relationship had been forged some years earlier in meetings at the Beechwood restaurant in the south side of Glasgow.<br>Ferguson and his wife Cathy lived in Simshill and would go to the local restaurant where Jock and Jean Stein and Sean Fallon, assistant manager at Celtic, and his wife Myra had a regular Saturday evening dinner date.<br>&lsquo;Inevitably, I would get a table beside them,&rsquo; says Ferguson. &lsquo;It was great to have a chat with him but, remember, I was a player then and I would never at that stage be too forward.<br>&lsquo;I would never ask how his game went that day or anything like that. I would never be that familiar. You were not at the level to ask such questions. He was a top manager at Celtic and I was a player at Rangers, totally different stations in life. But he was always really good to me.&rsquo;<br>As the friendship deepened, Stein and Ferguson talked every week on the phone. It was no surprise that Ferguson invited the manager who won the European Cup in 1967 to Gothenburg, where Aberdeen would defeat Real Madrid in the European Cup- Winners&rsquo; Cup final in 1983.<br>&lsquo;He was brilliant, never intrusive or overbearing. He told me, &ldquo;I am not going to get in your road. Get on with your business. If you need me, you know where I am&rdquo;.&rsquo;<br>Ferguson acted on two pieces of advice from Stein. &lsquo;He told me to make sure we took the second training session at the stadium on the night before the game,&rsquo; recalls Ferguson. &lsquo;Jock said that Alfredo di Stefano, the Real manager, would think we would have watched his session and might be unsettled by that.<br><br>&lsquo;Jock also bought a bottle of, I think, Black Label and he told me, &ldquo;Give that to Di Stefano as he comes off the pitch after the training session&rdquo;. I said, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Jock replied, &ldquo;He will think you are a wee guy from Aberdeen, that you are dancing to his tune, lying at his feet&rdquo;. I gave him the bottle of whisky and he did not know what to say to me. It was a sort of mumbled &ldquo;Gracias, gracias&rdquo;. I caught him on the back foot.<br>&lsquo;It may have gave him the impression that we were a wee club from Aberdeen and we had no right to be playing Real Madrid, that we were just grateful to be there.&rsquo;<br>He adds: &lsquo;It seems like a superficial thing, but it was profound. Clever.&rsquo; Aberdeen won 2-1.<br>Soon Ferguson and Stein were working for Scotland in the successful campaign to qualify for the 1986 World Cup, although he admitted he felt &lsquo;apprehensive&rsquo; about working with someone of Stein&rsquo;s stature.<br>&lsquo;You are working with someone who has won the European Cup, nine championships in a row. But I was starting to do well at Aberdeen. When he offered me the job I jumped at it. It was a boost for me at that time in my career. I was basically learning all the time and keen to do so. It was an honour first of all. But what an opportunity, the chance to learn from someone like Jock Stein.<br>&lsquo;To be honest with you, I bombarded him with a million questions every time I was in his company. It was just football, football, football.<br>&lsquo;But I learned, too, about the power of information. He was a great networker, knew everything that was going on. He used to phone me on a Saturday night and tell me all that was happening in the game.<br>&lsquo;He was sharp. He would tell me on Scotland duty that such and such a club official would be phoning in later to tell him that certain players had pulled out. And it would happen. He was always prepared for it.&rsquo;<br>What did the young Ferguson provide for Stein? &lsquo;My energy was important,&rsquo; says Ferguson, now 75 but in his forties when working with Stein. &lsquo;He had health problems and he maybe saw me as a driver on the training field.<br>&lsquo;I remember when he was offering me the job he told me I would do the training. I said, &ldquo;What about picking the team?&rdquo; And he replied, &ldquo;Aw no, son, that is my department. I will discuss it with you. You will be helpful in that area and don&rsquo;t be afraid to give your opinion, but that is my job&rdquo;.&rsquo;<br>Ferguson learned another lesson that has accompanied him through life. &lsquo;There was a great level of trust in me. There was respect,&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;I appreciated that. I have learned that when you pick an assistant the first thing, the most important thing, you need to look at is, &ldquo;Can I trust this man?&rdquo; He got trust from me. I idolised him.&rsquo;<br>Stein, he says, was a man of &lsquo;extraordinary intelligence&rsquo;, adding: &lsquo;He made it his business to find out everything. I was working with him with Scotland and he asked me to accompany him to the press conference. I told him I was taking one of the players to the gym. He said, &ldquo;No, come to the press conference, you will learn something&rdquo;.&rsquo;<br>Ferguson adds with a chuckle: &lsquo;Sitting outside the press conference, he would tell you something about each and every journalist: who liked the bookies too much or the drink or women, or whatever. He knew everything about them.&rsquo;<br>This knowledge stretched into every area. &lsquo;You knew he knew everything,&rsquo; says Ferguson. &lsquo;So when I became a manager I would tell him everything. You were frightened he would catch you out.<br>&lsquo;He would phone me every weekend. I would say something like, &ldquo;I have made a bid for Billy Stark&rdquo;. He would say, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a good move, he will be a good signing for you, I like him myself&rdquo;. Or I would tell him I thought one of my players was ready to leave and he asked me what I was thinking about in terms of replacing him, and would ask, &ldquo;What are you thinking about and have you thought of this or that?&rdquo;&rsquo;<br><br><br><br>Ferguson transformed all the clubs he worked for but his major impact was, of course, with Aberdeen and Manchester United &mdash; where he won a glut of European and domestic trophies.<br>&lsquo;I always believe I should address matters straight after the game,&rsquo; says Ferguson. &lsquo;But Jock was different. He always said it was better to leave it to the Monday, when everyone had calmed down a bit. He said, &ldquo;You will have a clear mind yourself and that helps&rdquo;. He was right for most people but that was not my nature. My nature was to get it all out the road and start afresh the next day.<br>&lsquo;His advice was great to hear but he was very understanding of my character, too. He understood that people would like to do things their way and he would help individuals match their character to a good way of working,&rsquo; explains Ferguson, who recalled Stein&rsquo;s immediate and dramatic impact at Celtic.<br>&lsquo;The size of the revolution was incredible. He took over a Celtic team in 1965 who were far from world-beaters. Two years later &mdash; with the addition of Willie Wallace and Joe McBride &mdash; he took them to the European Cup final and victory against a very good Inter Milan.<br>&lsquo;Think about it. It is astonishing. How did he do that in terms of changing not only personalities of the players but the very character of a team?<br>&lsquo;He recognised greatness when others could not. He saw potential when others missed it. For example, I played against Bobby Murdoch in reserve matches in the early 1960s and he was an outside right. All of a sudden he is playing centre midfield. He was the fulcrum for Celtic, hitting those long, diagonal passes or the short incisive pass or striking from outside.<br>&lsquo;I think Celtic had two world-class players who would have graced any team at any time. One was Bobby, the other was Jimmy Johnstone.<br><br>The event at the SSE Hydro on Thursday was attended by a host of fans, and former managers<br>&lsquo;Bertie Auld was nearly in that class, too. The rest were very, very good players but Jock transformed them into perennial winners.<br>&lsquo;Big Billy and John Clark were not the quickest but they never got caught out. They dropped off, never leaving space behind. Billy would win everything in the air, John would pick up second balls and cut off space. It was simple but very, very clever.<br>&lsquo;He basically always played with two wide. This left the opposition with a dilemma. In the cup final of 1965 I remember thinking, &ldquo;Do we push our full backs right on top against their wingers?&rdquo; &rsquo;<br>His overwhelming sense is that he was blessed to have known Stein. &lsquo;Every Celtic fan will have that sense of gratitude. It was an incredibly exciting ride for the club. And don&rsquo;t I know it. I had to suffer it for some time as a Rangers player.&rsquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Another tale of Lisbon &ndash; A Letter To Eugene</h3>by St Anthony<br>http://celticunderground.net/another-tale-of-lisbon/<br>The Celt fanzine is arguably the longest running football supporters&rsquo; publication in the UK having first been published 34 years ago in August of 1983.<br><br>Strictly speaking it&rsquo;s not a fanzine in the true sense. Although it does comment on current affairs at Celtic Park the main reason is to report and examine players and events in Celtic&rsquo;s long colourful history and it has had some notable contributors through the years including David Potter, Tom Campbell, Pat Woods and George Sheridan who have all went on to write notable Celtic books and publications over the years.<br><br>The late Eugene McBride was once the editor of &lsquo;The wee rag&rsquo;. Eugene was a remarkable man who had had a fascinating life and was a devout fan of Celtic all his days despite his exile in the south of England in his later years.<br><br>To note his contribution to The Celt publication Alex Ferguson (as a proud born and bred Govanite I refuse to refer to him as Sir) took time from his busy schedule to write a letter to Eugene. He has a story worth sharing and it is printed below:<br><br><blockquote><i>Dear Eugene,</i><br><br><i>May I congratulate you on your service to the Celt fanzine, you have had a truly remarkable career there.</i><br><br><i>I know there are many fanzines throughout the length and breadth of Great Britain, some satirical, some extremely critical and really you get a cross section of how the most important people &ndash; the fans &ndash; think about their team.</i><br><br><i>I think you have had some great moments and pleasure in these last six decades of chronicling the history of Celtic football club and I would like to recall a story of a day which is very special in the history of Celtic.</i><br><br><i>On 25th May 1967, my Granny&rsquo;s birthday, I was in Hong Kong playing for Scotland against a Hong Kong select and we won 4-1 and because of the time difference it was some hours before Celtic played in Lisbon. The humidity was terrible and none of us could sleep so a few of us sat down to play cards.</i><br><br><i>One of them was a goalkeeper called Harry Thomson who played for Burnley another was a young Clyde player called Harry Hood, anyway Thomson was quite scathing on Celtic&rsquo;s chances and gave very generous odds against them winning to which all the home Scots immediately plunged in with some good wagers.</i><br><br><i>Harry Thomson was sitting sweating his socks off worrying about the score, back then of course Hong Kong was far in advance of Great Britain in terms of television news, it came over every hour from all over the world. The news reader read about all the world news and ended by giving the half time score &ndash; Inter 1-0 Celtic. Well, we were as sick as pigs , not that we were all Celtic fans I stress ! But money does change people.</i><br><br><i>Harry Thomson was ecstatic and he was having a ball ridiculing Scottish football so then he decides he is going to up the odds and even went further and erased the goal lead that Inter had at half time, from memory I think he was giving 5/1 odds on Celtic for the second half. So we all plunged in again more out of anger but also in genuine hope that Celtic could pull off a miracle.</i><br><br><i>On went the card school for another hour until the next broadcast and the first words that came over from the news reader were not about world news but the score from Lisbon. &lsquo; Glasgow Celtic have become the first British club to win the European Cup&rsquo; and you can imagine the bedlam as poor Harry was being battered by all the lads and he lost a fortune. As the story goes he had to go to the treasurer of the SFA and get a loan covered by hos match fees to pay off the bets.</i><br><br><i>A great moment for all Celtic fans and I believe all of Scotland supported them that day.</i><br><br><i>Eugene, I hope you find my recollections of that day worthy of a place in your magazine. Take care of yourself and God bless.</i><br><br><i>Yours sincerely,</i><br><br><i>Alex</i><br></blockquote><br>Note: Sadly Alex Ferguson and his team mates did not receive Scotland caps for playing in these games as the SFA did not deem them as full internationals. In the above picture Ferguson is seen with team mate Jim McCalliog.  <br><br><img align="bottom" alt="1967-05-25: Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, European Cup - Supporters' Tales & Misc Articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="889" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/686884321f5dcb31a5d39d54cb8d5671/GW820H889" title="1967-05-25: Celtic 2-1 Inter Milan, European Cup - Supporters' Tales & Misc Articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="820"><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><br></div>
