It was just the vast scale of it that amazes all who look back on it. Forever it will be recorded to be a record attendance in the UK for a match and possibly forever in Europe. One day some egomaniac somewhere will demand his country to create a white elephant of a stadium which can hold even more and the club world record attendance will be broken, however until then it will never diminish the day and keep Celtic in the limelight. There were actually even more outside trying to get in! The actual world record for all football was recorded only days before at 149,000 for Scotland v England held again at the same stadium (Hampden). <br><br>People travelled from all over Scotland to this game, and in the days before car ownership was a common thing, that was some achievement, and the atmosphere could definitely be said to be packed and raucous. With no huns around, it was to be a glorious day for both sides. The Aberdeen manager himself was an-Celtic player (Travers) and so there was a bit of Celtic in both camps. For Aberdeen, they were challenging for their first Scottish Cup title (then the most prestigious cup in the land (although the league was most coveted)) whilst for Celtic it was their 15th! An incredible achievement for the time. <br><br>In the match, Celtic had a strong start which saw us take a 1-0 lead after just 12mins where a shot by Buchan was slotted into the back of the net by Crum after the goalkeeper had to parry the shot. However, the lead was very short-lived and Aberdeen equalized soon after in just one minute!<br><br>For much of the second half, it was mostly all Celtic with the midfield in control stifling their Aberdeen counterparts. Chic Geaton&rsquo;s was said to have been the gem in our midfield, controlling it magnificently. However, as much as our strikers were creating the opposition problems, it required the intervention of the legendary Jimmy McGrory to create the opportunity that won us the cup, freeing up Willie Buchan to shoot past the opposition goalkeeper with 20mins to go. Aberdeen claimed a handball from McGrory in the move to the goal, but not given or substantiated.<br><br>Full-time whistle went, and a landmark in the club game was complete. <br><br>Celtic were winners of the Scottish cup for the 15th time. Aberdeen had to wait a bit longer for their first time to get their hands on the cup but a new giant of the Scottish game was born. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Teams   </h3><b>CELTIC:</b>   <br>Kennaway; Hogg and Morrison; Geatons.

The attendance fell only 5000 below the record attendance of over 149,000 set up at the Scotland-England international at the same ground on the previous Saturday. The difficulties confronting officials in dealing with such a huge crowd are referred to on another page. <br><br>The match was worthily won by Celtic, who were a more solid, hard-working team throughout the game. Certainly both sides missed a number of good chances, but Celtic were a good bit ahead on point of play, and because of a greater steadiness in the outfield. <br><br>It was the Aberdeen club&#39;s first Scottish Cup final and their team scarcely rose to the occasion. The wing half-backs were particularly disappointing, and their usual winging game was not profitable, without sound backing. <br><br>Although by no means a match of extraordinary excitement or great football skill, it was notable for the confidence of the Celtic team, who were true to their Cup traditions.<br><br>McGrory, now a veteran, played quite an inspiring part and Geatons, another long-service player, was the outstanding half-back on the field. Crum scored the opening goal in eleven minutes, but Aberdeen hit back immediately, and equalised through Armstrong a minute later. Celtic had the bulk of the pressure until well on in the second half, when Aberdeen made their biggest effort. This failed, and eighteen minutes from the end Buchan got the wining goal. <br><br><b><font size="4">WINNING GOAL DOUBT<br><br>BUT CELTIC THE BETTER TEAM <br><br>REFEREE&#39;S GOOD WORK</font></b><br><br>There was just a slight doubt about the legitimacy of the winning goal in the Scottish Cup final between Celtic and Aberdeen. The latter had staged a last rally against a better team and had failed, when the ball went loose and far upfield. The veteran Celtic leader, McGrory. and the young Aberdeen full back, Temple, both made for the bouncing ball and had the back kicked out lustily the score might have been averted. Instead he waited, and in a slack tackle, the ball was carried clear by the centre, who appeared to have played it with his arm. This was possibly inadvertent, but while the Aberdeen players threw up their arms in protest the game was won and lost. The ball was sent forward, and Buchan outstripped the defence to turn the ball past the onrushing goalkeeper. Even so. the ball struck the near post and rolled along and across the goal line to lodge just inside the far post. <br><br>It was fortunate perhaps that such a goal fell to the team who were undoubtedly the better combination. This and other things were probably recognised when the Aberdeen players at the final whistle included Mr M. C. Hutton the referee for their congratulations. Indeed, when the features of the game were recalled few were more pleasing than the splendid refereeing. Mr Hutton worked the diagonal system with his linesmen to perfection, and in order that they might keep in a safe position for watching one or other part of the field, he often followed the ball in a flanking position and signalled <br><br><b><font size="4">OFFSIDE TRAPS</font></b><br><br>The efficacy of the methods of referee and linesmen were shown by the promptitude of offside decisions, which were fairly frequent with the Celtic backs deliberately and boldly laying traps for their opponents. Possibly they would not have been so bold had the referee not been so sound in his own positioning. <br><br>The real highlight of play, however, was Aberdeen&#39;s equalising goal. Celtic opened wonderfully confidently, and after hammering at the Aberdeen goal for the best part of ten minutes they opened the scoring when Crum turned the ball into the net after Johnstone had saved a shot following a deflected free-kick. The opening goal in a Cup-tie is so often a fatal blow that it was entirely unexpected when the Aberdeen forwards swept down the field and Beynon crossed hard for the ball to be deflected to Armstrong, who smartly netted. <br><br>This put Aberdeen in a favourable position. Their defenders steadied, but over the game Celtic were the steadier, harder working, and more virile lot. Both sides had a plan apparently. Celtic with their offside tactics in defence, did much to stop the fast Aberdeen raiders while, in attack with McGrory not having the same pace, Delaney, who played orthodox and positional football in the international match in the previous week, had a roving campaign purposing to upset the Aberdeen rear lines. In this he appeared to succeed, inasmuch as the left flank of the Northern side was shaken throughout <br><br><b><font size="4">FAULTLESS DISPLAY BY GEATONS </font></b><br><br>The strength of the Celtic attack, however, was built upon a faultless display by Geatons, who moved confidently and boldly with the ball, and while defenders vainly chased Delaney and marked McGrory, he was responsible for several fine crosses and straight lobs towards goal <br><br>Against that the Aberdeen wing half-backs never struck their usual strong game. It is a commentary, though possibly not entirely applicable that while Dunlop was struggling and Thomson was clearly beaten, it was the Celtic inside wing forwards who broke away from their markers to score. Another big disappointment in the Aberdeen team was Mills upon whom so much responsibility rested. Everything he did was methodical and clever, but his passing, was poor and far too often did he draw a defender only to push the ball to that lucky individual&#39;s feet. McKenzie, the ex-Heart of Midlothian player, was the best of the attack that failed. <br><br>Aberdeen, with their waiting wingers, had often too few players working, whereas every Celt followed the ball and did his share in the marking and tackling, the forwards thus giving the Aberdeen defenders more to do than merely position themselves for clearing.<br><br>Undoubtedly, Strauss the hard shooting South Africa, was missed by Aberdeen. In their rally Lang had a couple of good chances which, it is probable, Strauss would have taken. At the other goal, however, Murphy and McGrory made mistakes just as bad or worse. Nevertheless, McGrory, though far past his best and generally well held by Falloon, proved a great urge to his younger colleagues. Delaney, it would appear, played his part in a plan, and did not attract the notice he might have done. Buchan was skillful in his passes and was smart to take the winning goal . In that respect he has pulled Celtic through most of their ties this season even when not at his best. In the Celtic rear ranks, Geatons as mentioned was outstanding, and the others covered well, while Kennaway, like Johnstone was a good goalkeeper. <br><br><b><font size="4">RUN OF PLAY</font></b><br><br>Celtic began in confident mood, and for ten minutes the Aberdeen defenders underwent a harassing experience, so much so that free kicks were conceded in dangerous positions , and when Celtic went ahead the score was deserved. Johnstone saved from McGrory after the free kick had been deflected, but the centre-forward was on the ball like lighting , and lunged at it to send It forward to Crum who had no difficulty in scoring. Almost immediately afterwards Aberdeen got on terms. For the first time the Celtic defence showed indecision and with both Hogg and Kennaway failing to clear Benyon&#39;s cross Armstrong got the equaliser. This surprise seemed to upset Celtic, whose defence for some, time afterwards was not at all certain, and the interval arrived with the scores level. Celtic had obviously gamed composure during the interval, and played with more confidence and certainty at the restart and the Parkhead forwards soon swarmed to the attack, and gave Aberdeen an anxious time. Aberdeen rallied, and gained unexpected opportunities, only to fail by indecision and unreadiness to shoot. Then came Buchan&#39;s winning goal, and although Aberdeen did strike back again, the game was won and lost. <br><br><b><font size="4">CELTIC TRADITION </font></b><br><br>How much this 15th Cup victory was due to Mr William Maley, the Celtic manager, who celebrated his 69th birthday at the week-end, is difficult to assess, but he appears to be the influence behind the tactics which versatile Celtic players can produce always to combat other sides. It might be mentioned also that <a href="/page/Travers%2C+Patrick" target="_self">Mr P. Travers</a> manager of Aberdeen, who have made such a bold and consistent fight for honours during the past few seasons, is an ex-Celtic player. Celtic tradition and training has left another indelible mark on this season&#39;s Scottish Cup tournament. The winners have had to fight all the way too. They can hardly compare with Celtic elevens of several seasons ago, and, indeed, there were only four, players who were not getting a Cup medal for the first time so great have been the changes at Parkhead through transfers since 1933, when Motherwell were beaten in the final. <br><br>The teams in the final were:&mdash; <br>Celtic&mdash;Kennaway; Hogg and Morrison; Geatons. Lyon, and Paterson; Delaney, Buchan, McGrory, Crum, and Murphy.<br>Aberdeen&mdash;Johnstone: Cooper and Temple; Dunlop, Falloon, and Thomson; Benyon, McKenzie. Armstrong. Mills, and Lang.<div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Glasgow Herald April 26 1937</h3><br><img align="bottom" alt="1937 SC Final" height="1006" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/0bf17a02936beddb86e1c40550327b38/GW962H1006" title="1937 SC Final" width="962"><br><h3>Match report from The (London) Times,Monday, Apr 26, 1937</h3></div><div></div><div><img alt="1937-04-24: Celtic 2-1 Aberdeen, Scottish Cup Final - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Z432RfCM0siS6_uAIfOCUA298834" title="1937-04-24: Celtic 2-1 Aberdeen, Scottish Cup Final - The Celtic Wiki"> </div><br></div></div>
