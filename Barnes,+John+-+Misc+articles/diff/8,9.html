Yes, he    was ultimately a failure in Scotland, but being a failed British manager is    surely the basis for inclusion rather than ostracism. And, unlike so    many of his peers who ballsed up from start to increasingly inevitable,    finish, Barnes was viciously unlucky when Henrik Larsson &ndash; the best    player in Scotland, followed by a ridiculous amount of daylight &ndash; broke    his leg in a Uefa Cup tie in Lyon. As Larsson&#39;s leg snapped  grotesquely   at 45 degrees, so Celtic&#39;s season did a 180. As the table  below shows,   their form with and without him was not so much hot and  cold as  volcanic  and Antarctic.<br><br><blockquote><div> Celtic under John Barnes with and without Henrik Larsson<br><br>....................Played..Won..Drawn..Lost...For...Against..Win %age..Loss %age..Goals/game..Goals conceded/game<br>Before       injury.....13......12.......0........1......42..........3.............92............8.................3.23.....................0.23<br>After       injury........16.......7.......2........7.......33........22............44...........44.................2.06......................1.4</div></blockquote><br>Celtic    were not just winning with Larsson; they were dismantling teams with    some gloriously aesthetic football. Indeed, five days before that Lyon    match they had eviscerated Aberdeen 7-0 &ndash; and been berated by Barnes  for   their sloppy passing. (In one of the great forgotten hexes, Celtic   beat  Aberdeen 5-0, 7-0, 6-0 and 5-1 in their four league meetings  that   season.) It is easy to say that a side should not be so dependent  on  one  player, and that&#39;s a valid point, but Larsson was so superior  as to   make that a simple fact of life. In six seasons between 1998 and  his   departure in 2004, Larsson was the league&#39;s top scorer in five;    1999-2000 was the exception that ruled against Barnes. In the following    season, Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s first at the club, Larsson scored 53 goals  as   Celtic won a treble. Barnes might have let things unravel anyway;  or,   with Larsson fit and firing, he rather than O&#39;Neill might have  been the   man who knocked Rangers off their perch.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Dalglish defends Parkhead slump</h3>Wednesday, November 10, 1999 Published at 12:11 GMT<br>BBC<br><br>John Barnes (centre): Under fire after poor results<br><br>Kenny Dalglish has pleaded with the Parkhead faithful to give himself and head coach John Barnes more time to turn the club around.<br><br>On Sunday, Cetlic were defeated by Rangers at Ibrox, a result that followed a Uefa Cup exit to Lyon and a dismal home league defeat to a Motherwell side reduced to 10 men before half-time.<br><br>Those results have prompted criticism of both Barnes&#39; tactics and Director of Football Dalglish&#39;s own contribution as an often silent partner in the much-vaunted double act who joined the club in the summer.<br><br>Now Dalglish has opted to speak out in defence of Barnes and has pleaded with the irate fans to be patient.<br><br>In Celtic&#39;s official club newspaper &#39;Celtic View&#39;, Dalglish is quoted as saying: &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the right time for a knee-jerk reaction. There is no-one on the football staff who doesn&#39;t feel as disappointed as the fans do.<br><br>&quot;I think people ought to remember what we said at the outset - it&#39;s not a here today, gone tomorrow thing. Success is not going to be there at the turn of a key.<br><br>&quot;Eventually the fans will have what they want to see. There is no point in feeling sorry for ourselves, we just have to roll our sleeves up and work even harder.&quot;<br><br>Dalglish has been angered by the criticism directed at his appointment of Barnes whose rigid 4-2-2-2 formation has led several observers to query whether he has the experience for the task.<br><br>&quot;If anyone can guarantee a system that&#39;s going to work in every game and every minute of every match then we&#39;ll do it. The players are 100% committed and everyone is in it together,&quot; Dalglish said.<br><br>&quot;John is new to the job, but that doesn&#39;t mean he cannot do the job. I&#39;ve seen him handle the players, I&#39;ve seen him talk to them.

Chief executive Allan MacDonald has  described the 3-1 embarrassment at Parkhead as &quot;totally unacceptable to  myself, my fellow directors and simply not good enough for the Celtic  support&quot;. <br><br><div class="bodytext">In a statement, he said: &quot;I am  addressing this situation as a matter of urgency with our Director of  Football Kenny Dalglish, who is returning this evening from club  business overseas. &quot;The situation will be fully reviewed immediately on  his return.&quot; Angry fans protested outside the ground after the defeat  and called for Barnes to be fired. <b><br><br>Shares slump</b>   <br>The  result marked the biggest Scottish Cup shock in more than 30 years of  football and hit the club financially. Celtic&#39;s shares dropped by  four-and-a-half per cent when trading opened on Wednesday morning,  wiping &pound;3m off its value. Barnes, he former Liverpool idol who took up  the head coach job at the start of the season, is now facing louder  calls for his resignation. </div>  <br><div class="bodytext"> The  anticipated Celtic renaissance under the dream-team of Kenny Dalglish as  director of football and Barnes, albeit an inexperienced choice of  coach, has failed to materialise. Worse still for the Parkhead fans,  Rangers are marching away in the Premier League and look set to lift  this year&#39;s title. <br><br><b>&#39;Internal problem&#39;</b>   <br>During the  post-match inquest, Barnes put a brave face on his position and insisted  he would not resign. But he hinted at a half-time bust-up with players  and also admitted that what happens over the next few days may not be  within his control. </div>  <br><div class="bodytext">The Tuesday night  match saw Mark Viduka replaced at the interval, despite being the  Parkhead club&#39;s leading scorer, and Ian Wright came on in his place  before Paul Sheerin&#39;s 57th-minute penalty sealed a famous win. When  asked why Viduka was withdrawn, Barnes said: &quot;We had a bit of problem  which we will deal with internally. &quot;In the coming days we will have  more to say about that. &quot;There was a situation so there is no real point  hiding that fact. <b><br><br>Meetings planned</b>   <br>&quot;It will all  come out in the next few days. I don&#39;t want to say very much now. &quot;I  want to focus on what a disappointing performance this was overall. </div>  <br><div class="bodytext">&quot;It  was a serious situation and there will be meetings about it in the  coming days. After that we&#39;ll issue a statement.&quot; Viduka has emerged as  Celtic&#39;s most influential player since Henrik Larsson broke his leg and  the Australian striker has already been linked with a possible move to  either England or Spain. Barnes went on: &quot;To be honest if the situation  does not improve by the end of the season, I won&#39;t have to consider my  situation, it will be done for me. <br><br><b>&#39;Magnitude of disaster&#39;</b>   <br>&quot;Right  now however I&#39;m not considering my position because I still feel we  have a lot to play for, even so I&#39;m not belittling the magnitude of this  disaster.&quot; Former Celtic manager Billy McNeill believes John Barnes can  survive, his long-term future was by no means certain. </div>  <br><div class="bodytext">&quot;I  for one will not be calling for the managers head because I think that  continuity is much better than regular changes,&quot; said McNeill, who is  still a legend among the Celtic support as a member of the famous  &quot;Lisbon Lions&quot; who won the European Cup in 1967. &quot;Certainly John Barnes  is going to need an awful lot of confidence in his own ability to get  over this one. He&#39;s got to go back through the process of proving  himself very strenuously to the Celtic supporters that he&#39;s the man for  the job,&quot; said McNeill. </div>  <br><div class="bodytext">And he blamed  the lack of commitment of some of the multi-million pound imports at  Parkhead, players who he said lack the passion to play for the club: &quot;I  am old fashioned and I think Celtic need a core of players who know what  the club is all about, understand the background and the makeup of the  club and really feel proud to be playing for them.&quot; Bob Crampsey, who  wrote the club&#39;s centenary history, said: &quot;I think it&#39;s the worst Celtic  result ever without a doubt. What was surprising was not the defeat but  the ease with which the defeat was accomplished, and the margin.&quot; <br><br>&quot;There  are over 50 players on the Celtic books and I think it&#39;s yet another  indication of the amount of dead wood there is on the books at Parkhead  at the moment. </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Barnes sacked as Dalglish holds the fort</h3><font color="#333333">Football Unlimited staff   <a class="external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/" name="&lid={contentTypeByline}{guardian.co.uk}&lpos={contentTypeByline}{1}" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">guardian.co.uk</a>,   Thursday 10 February 2000 17.57 GMT </font><br><br>John  Barnes has been sacked as manager of Celtic. Barnes, along with  assistant coach Eric Black, has had his contract at the club terminated.  Terry McDermott will leave Parkhead by mutual agreement. Director of  football Kenny Dalglish will take temporary charge of first team  affairs. <br><br>At a press conference held this afternoon to announce  Barnes&#39; departure, Dalglish defended his protege&#39;s tenure. &quot;John Barnes  is an admirable fellow and someone I think will go on in later years to  establish himself as very successful in managing a football club,&quot; he  said. &quot;Unfortunately it won&#39;t be at Celtic Football Club.&quot;<br><br>Dalglish  was also strong in his support for McDermott, who had been the subject  of some criticism in the press and labelled with the tag of Celtic&#39;s  &#39;social manager&#39;. &quot;For people to suggest he was a social manager is an  absolute joke. Terry worked hard for the club and received tremendous  respect from all the players.&quot;<br><br>However, Dalglish reserved his  most passionate words for the Celtic players. Claiming they shared an  equal responsibility with the coaching staff for the club&#39;s current  plight, Dalglish said: &quot;The supporters demand that the players who wear  the shirt wear it with pride. We want players who are totally committed.  If they aren&#39;t they don&#39;t deserve to be here. We can accept bad results  and performances but we can never accept anything less than 100%  commitment.&quot;<br><br>Barnes&#39; dismissal will not come as any surprise. His  position has looked untenable since Celtic&#39;s shock 3-1 home defeat at  the hands of Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Tuesday night, but rumbles  of discontent have been echoing around Celtic Park almost ever since  Barnes&#39; appointment as manager last July.<br><br>There have been  disputes over Barnes&#39; tactics, over his coaching qualifications, and  more recently over the standard of player he brought to the club: Eyal  Berkovic, Olivier Tebily and Stilian Petrov are three of the big-money  buys who have failed to impress the Parkhead faithful.<br><br>The club  have given no indication as to how long it will take to find Barnes&#39;  permanent successo, chief executive Allan MacDonald insisting, &quot;we won&#39;t  sacrifice quality for speed.&quot;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Expectation is the enemy of Barnes </h3><h3 class="info">By Glenn Moore<br>Saturday, 4 December 1999 </h3>  (Independent)<br><br>It  was finally official. Scotland&#39;s crisis club had &quot;an emergency  situation&quot;. However, the solution was not the sacking of John Barnes,  the coach, nor the resignation of Kenny Dalglish, the football  operations officer, but the evacuation of Celtic Park.<br><br>The irony  was delicious. The assembled media, having heard from Barnes - but not  the players, who had refused to attend a planned publicity launch - were  waiting for Dalglish and Allan MacDonald, the chief executive, to  deliver a vote of confidence in the coach. Then the public address  emitted a sound like an air-raid warning following by a request: &quot;An  emergency situation has arisen in the stadium. Please leave by the  nearest exit in an orderly fashion.&quot;<br><br>Very suspicious, but off we  trooped to wait in the car park along with a shivering youth team in  freezing temperatures. Several fire engines duly arrived before, just as  the snow began to fall, the doors re-opened and Dalglish and MacDonald  made their appeal for time.<br><br>Time, as Barnes observed in his  recent autobiography, is a luxury managers do not have, but even he may  be surprised at the pressure building on him after just six months at  Celtic Park. For Barnes, who won everything English football had to  offer, including 79 international caps, is finding life more difficult  in a Scottish dug-out.<br><br>The problems began for the 36-year-old on  21 October when Celtic lost at Lyon in the Uefa Cup and, more seriously,  Henrik Larsson suffered an injury which is likely to keep him out for  the season. Though he scored 35 out of their 99 goals last season,  Larsson is more than just a goalscorer to Celtic. He is involved in the  build-up play in a way that his replacement, Ian Wright, is never going  to be and, more than that, is, according to one observer, the presiding  &quot;deity of Celtic Park&quot;.<br><br>A series of defeats, including a 4-2 loss  to Rangers, intensified the mood and Wednesday&#39;s League Cup victory  over Dundee has not eased the pressure, although Celtic won despite  having only 10 men. Instead the papers are full of talk of revolts after  several players openly criticised the sale of Craig Burley.<br><br>Yesterday&#39;s  regular press conference was, admitted Barnes himself, &quot;an inquest&quot;  into the transfer, the mood and the results. On the surface he was as  relaxed as ever, leaning back in his chair and making quips in seductive  Jamaican burr. But, behind the smile, he was watchful and defensive.  The words came more slowly than usual, each weighed for the damage they  might do if turned against him, and for the message they sent out to  players and bosses.<br><br>&quot;It was a fantastic performance but the  players have not received the credit they deserved because the papers  have been dominated by other things,&quot; he said. &quot;The response to  [Burley&#39;s sale] from certain players has not been as good as I would  have liked. Players have responsibility to conduct themselves in the  right manner and I am disappointed, but I will not hold it against them.  I won&#39;t be dropping anyone.&quot;<br><br>Burley&#39;s move was partly  precipitated by his desire to play in a different manner to the holding  midfield position Barnes had ascribed to him. That, and the reaction of  his team-mates, illustrated a point Barnes made in his book about player  power. Yesterday he admitted: &quot;You can&#39;t manage the way managers used  to. Football has changed and you have to change with the times.&quot;<br><br>This  cannot be easy for Barnes, a man of stronger opinions than his relaxed  manner would suggest. Brought up by a father who placed great emphasis  on discipline, he is most influenced, in management style, by the  similarly strict Graham Taylor.<br><br>Barnes&#39; footballing philosophy is  radically different to Taylor&#39;s old long ball game, but there is a link  in his espousal of what he calls a team&#39;s DNA, a structure which  functions regardless of personnel.<br><br>His ideal is 4-2-2-2 as  practised by France and Brazil. Unfortunately Celtic do not possess  players like Lillian Turham and Bixente Lizarazu, or Cafu and Roberto  Carlos. Instead they have Stephane Mahe and Jackie McNamara. As a result  the team became too narrow in their play, with the middle pairing, Eyal  Berkovic and Lubo Moravcik, getting in each other&#39;s way.<br><br>Barnes  has now changed to the more conventional 3-5-2, though whether it was  his decision, or forced upon him by the players, is a matter of dispute.  The ball is also being moved forward more positively; previously the  play reflected Barnes&#39; obsession with &quot;the sanctity of passing&quot;.<br><br>The  opportunity to coach Celtic was, he admitted, &quot;a real shock&quot; and his  arrival, on a three-year &pound;1.5m contract, was greeted with scepticism. He  understood why.<br><br>&quot;I was an untried, untested commodity and  turning round Celtic represented a huge task,&quot; he said. &quot;I understood  the misgivings of those who argued the job should have gone to an older,  better known manager. But I have never lacked confidence in my  ability.&quot;<br><br>Does he now wish he had more experience? There is a  very long pause before he replies: &quot;I am hesitating because you can  always say you wish you had more experience. As a player at 17 you could  wish you had played in World Cups. I want to do well. I don&#39;t  necessarily need more experience. Experience means you might deal with  the press and players in different ways, but whether you are competent  to do the job is a different thing.<br><br>&quot;When I took the job I  thought: &#39;If things go well and I win every game this is going to  happen. If things don&#39;t go so well this will happen.&#39; I&#39;m not going to  say I expected this situation because I didn&#39;t want it to happen but I  knew if we went through a dodgy patch it would.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t know how  big a job it is. Maybe we will turn it around after the Dundee game and  carry on winning. I would like to wait until the end of the season and  say this is what I need. At the moment I don&#39;t think we are too far  away.&quot;<br><br>Celtic have won everything the Scottish game has to offer,  many times. But, of their 77 major trophies, including the European  Cup, only four have come this decade as Rangers have dominated the  Scottish game. While they picked up nine successive titles Celtic were  flirting with bankruptcy, undergoing an economic regeneration and  chewing up managers. Barnes is the seventh this decade. Thus yesterday&#39;s  appeal for calm and a long-term perspective.<br><br>Barnes is under  immense pressure from outside but, as Charlie Nicholas pointed out  recently, the last thing Celtic need is another manager. Besides, it  would be a huge admission of error.<br><br>Even the plummeting value of  the share price may be withstood; there is no majority shareholder. With  resolute will on all sides, Barnes, who has interesting ideas on the  game, could be a success, but to do that he has eventually to eclipse  Rangers. The learning curve is steep. As one Celtic fan said: &quot;They have  the former manager of the Netherlands and PSV Eindhoven, we have a YTS  trainee.&quot;<br><br>The alarm yesterday was provoked by a faulty smoke  detector. As with the crisis it appeared there was smoke without fire.  Not yet.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Scotsman</h3>30 November 1999: &lsquo;John Barnes is the trouble in Paradise&rsquo;<br>YOUTH  and inexperience will never be added to the list of humankind&rsquo;s deadly  sins, but, in the matter of co-ordinating the operation at a major  football club floundering despairingly in the wake of its bitterest  rivals, they can be serious character flaws.<br>Whatever allowances  may be made for the raw naivete of Celtic&rsquo;s head coach John Barnes  during his novitiate, it is becoming increasingly difficult to escape  the conclusion that his appointment was the result of extremely poor  judgment.<br>But Barnes is merely the tip of the veritable iceberg of  cronyism which has formed at Celtic Park in the short time &ndash; is it  really only five months? &ndash; since Allan MacDonald succeeded Fergus McCann  as chief executive. This is an imposing structure, running from  MacDonald through the director of football, Kenny Dalglish, to the head  coach, Barnes, to &ldquo;entertainments officer&rdquo; Terry McDermott and  goalkeeping coach Terry Gennoe.<br>If Barnes, after a period yielding  five defeats from eight games and culminating in the embarrassment of  Motherwell on Sunday night, is perceived by supporters and many in the  media as a blight at Parkhead, its source should be regarded as even  more damaging.<br>At a club of the magnitude and ambitions of Celtic,  it will surely strike most of their fans and considerable shareholders  as unacceptable to have the chief executive call an old friend and offer  him the job of director of football; for the latter then to phone  another old pal and make him head coach; and so on down the chain of  command.<br>When Dalglish and Barnes were moved into position, the  idea that they were some kind of &ldquo;dream team&rdquo; eagerly awaited by a  rapturous support was a piece of media-led ballyhoo. I have yet to meet a  Celtic supporter &ndash; and many colleagues have related a similar  experience &ndash; who did not have deep misgivings.<br>These were based  largely on Dalglish&rsquo;s experience at Blackburn and Newcastle and on  Barnes&rsquo;s total lack of it. Dalglish justified his appointment of his  former protege and team-mate at Liverpool by insisting that he had  revolutionary ideas on how the game should be played and that he would  prove to be the brightest new star in the firmament.<br>Barnes may be  discovering (given his apparent imperviousness to suggestions or  constructive criticism, this is not  certain) that being ahead of your  time is often as irrelevant as being behind the times; success tends to  be achieved by exceptional people of their time.  When the original  Universal Man himself, Leonardo da Vinci, proposed that humans one day  would fly, it was a marvellous notion which anticipated later  developments in aeronautics; but it was not of its day, as even  Renaissance Italy had not the technology to make it  operable. Leonardo  was celebrated for the work which appealed to 15th-16th century art  connoisseurs.<br>Similarly, Barnes&rsquo;s ideas on &ldquo;how the game should be  played&rdquo; seem out of kilter with both the players at his disposal and  the modus operandi of opponents who keep beating his team. In fairness  to the head coach, it is understood that he was probably not responsible  for some of the players who have been recruited during his term.<br>It  is said at Parkhead that Oliver  Tebily, Bobby Petta and Stilian  Petrov, none of whom has exactly captured the affection of the club&rsquo;s  followers, were brought to Celtic by Dalglish, part of whose remit  includes scouting for fresh &ldquo;talent&rdquo;. Indeed, it seems that the only new  signing with Barnes&rsquo;s fingerprints upon him is Eyal Berkovic. Even if  that is the case, there have been assurances from Dalglish that Barnes  has complete autonomy in the business of ultimately approving signings,  training, tactics  and team selection. So far, his adroitness in most of  these areas has been  questionable.<br>Petrov arrived at Celtic to  something of a press fanfare, a &ldquo;teenage sensation&rdquo; who was supposedly  the most outstanding young player in Bulgaria. Whatever talent he may  possess has been well concealed; to the extent, indeed, that nobody,  including the player himself, appears to know which position he plays.<br>While  experience has shown us the wisdom of not making hurried judgments,  there are certain players whose unlikely brilliance can be sensed. A  Dutchman who has been allowed to play with Ipswich in Nationwide  Division 1 without attracting the interest of a Premiership club is a  prime example. Nothing Petta has shown since his arrival in Glasgow has  left us looking foolish.<br>Tebily, like Petrov, was at the heart of  Sunday&rsquo;s ineptitude at Fir Park and has also been involved in most of  the other defeats which offer evidence that the new management team at  Celtic have made a difficult job look easy. That is, they have succeeded  in reversing the progress of recent years by inducing deterioration.  The rate at which they have gone backwards, of course, has been  exaggerated by the simultaneous improvement of Rangers under Dick  Advocaat.<br>Tebily has pace, strength, athleticism and willingness,  but certainly lacks astuteness and concentration in defence and it is  doubtful if he will acquire these essential qualities. He may have  potential, but, like the head coach himself, he has no business serving  his apprenticeship at Celtic.<br>Barnes does not help his own image  with an affected smartness which impresses as mere pseudo-intelligence,  accompanied by the supercilious posturing once favoured by the &ldquo;boxer&rdquo;,  Chris Eubank (anyone who knows anything about the fight game will recall  that he wasn&rsquo;t very good, either).<br>Whenever Barnes answers a pre-  or post-match question with one of his own, it is clearly intended  somehow to highlight the inferior knowledge or competence of the  interrogator.<br>Instead, he succeeds simply in making himself appear  infantile and implausible, his replies at times as unfathomable as the  spiel of an old-time, travelling snake oil salesman.<br> In essence,  Barnes, like his team, tends to lack substance. You can&rsquo;t buy that on  the market and nobody at Celtic has the time to wait for it to develop.<br><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1119" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/112755098d097d985ef0849a20ba1f27/GW1024H1119" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1339" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/8c2b33dca945758b49f01ece772cda46/GW1024H1339" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/8a3c1d0eca0b62e7209571439c762b63" title="from Neg Sludden"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1319" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/bcb04ff71c9991bfa39600d4f9c95fac/GW1024H1319" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1336" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/8883b5c165902c06ac3eaa57da48363f/GW1024H1336" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1146" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/72ed48b9c3f7c8da060f708a5b24ed41/GW1024H1146" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1366" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/60885fef959c878f8d95681591f866a4/GW1024H1366" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1347" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c73fa63ca6868acb3a6569f37e542248/GW1024H1347" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1328" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/360fa92a6a965fc887610a421ebc8d58/GW1024H1328" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1326" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d41ea428bca79cc1ed83295b1049e045/GW1024H1326" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1332" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d0a6e8aa3e606a69f289b1f38e65e97b/GW1024H1332" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1337" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/5275edc650d3b371c57d0bdb5667ca4a/GW1024H1337" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1337" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/d919c8ae0c9adda9eeddd1e0c4d22a41/GW1024H1337" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1118" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/43d7091be50989f5a2481f94c5bb789b/GW1024H1118" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1337" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/15c628f7c6e0db5435aae998071a2862/GW1024H1337" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/2d965001b9fcb7c45f95e91730924f88" title="from Neg Sludden"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1146" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/150c0912ff88cca24f1c640d16970e70/GW1024H1146" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1384" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/1f3a95b0bd0154a7660503d359d58db7/GW1024H1384" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1406" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/a0661922512288129e40f536cbe987b2/GW1024H1406" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/088c3ffca7f6573f9e07b95c863df906" title="from Neg Sludden"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1125" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/8363b670f5e7bbaf1278513539d5999f/GW1024H1125" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1330" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/831c26e80b09e8327c7589c8b0157165/GW1024H1330" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1345" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/3114ee5cb4a23a6c86d2f91510083c36/GW1024H1345" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1341" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c23d07b96258edb4c2e9e7e37dd235b2/GW1024H1341" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="from Neg Sludden" height="1352" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c2cf9e99c9b543128e97a78dba48378f/GW1024H1352" title="from Neg Sludden" width="1024"><br><br>June 1999<br><img align="bottom" alt="Barnes, John -
