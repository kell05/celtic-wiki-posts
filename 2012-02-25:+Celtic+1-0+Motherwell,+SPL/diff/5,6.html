Forrest was poor for  the first hour, and should probably have been hooked at half time.  Thankfully he finished strongly. Sammy was very good again, and worked  tirelessly, providing a lovely knock-down for Hooper&#39;s goal. I thought  we missed Brown&#39;s energy in the middle in the first half. Ki, whilst  undoubtedly an excellent footballer, doesn&#39;t offer the drive that Brown  does.<br><br>The back four were very solid and I don&#39;t recall Forster  having any saves to make of note. Mulgrew had probably his best game in  the left-back position since his return to the club. A good captain&#39;s  performance!<br><br>20 domestic wins in a row! (how many games unbeaten, including Europe...?)<br><br>We  are going to win this without kicking a ball unfortunately, as Rangers  will continue to drop points. Starting tomorrow hopefully... 						 						 						 					<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="2012-02-25: Celtic 1-0 Motherwell, SPL - Pic" height="449" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/9P7TMC1E2mn9anKS8zDMMQ95758/GW600H449" title="2012-02-25: Celtic 1-0 Motherwell, SPL - Pic" width="600"><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>  <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>     01   Forster              </li><li>     06   Wilson     Booked           </li><li>     21   Mulgrew              </li><li>     25   Rogne              </li><li>     02   Matthews              </li><li>     16   Ledley              </li><li>     18   Ki Sung-Yeung              </li><li>     67   Wanyama            (Stokes - 58&#39;

With Celtic assured of reclaiming the championship, supporters and players would be forgiven a drop in intensity.<br><br>The cut and thrust of competition has been removed from the summit of the Scottish Premier League, an unusual circumstance in recent times. Celtic&#39;s lead over Rangers &ndash; which now sits at 23 points &ndash; means they must find fresh forms of motivation. For now, the continuation of a superb domestic run seems to fuel the fires of Neil Lennon and his players. That record now sits at 20 domestic wins in a row, with 17 successive victories secured in the league. The fascinating prospect of Celtic heading to Ibrox on 25 March to seal the title remains alive.<br><br>Dispassionate onlookers will be particularly interested in the level of atmosphere and standard of football at this venue as Rangers try to emerge from their troubled state. There has been no immediate dip in either, although the notion that the novelty of a lack of competition from across the city will soon wear off on Glasgow&#39;s green half is widely perpetuated. We are still a long way short of finding out, whatever the truth of that theory.<br><br>When Motherwell visited, it was Celtic&#39;s bullish second-half showing that kickstarted a hitherto tame affair. Gary Hooper scored the game&#39;s crucial goal, handing the league leaders a win they merited. There have been spells on this winning run where Celtic have performed to a far superior level than was the case here, although Motherwell&#39;s firm level of resistance is partly responsible for that.<br><br>Rangers&#39; widely publicised troubles should not mask what wider credit is due to Motherwell for their achievements already this season.<br><br>The fact Stuart McCall has guided his side into third place is notable enough, without Motherwell being so close to Rangers that a 10-point deduction for the Ibrox club triggered what now looks a meaningful race for second. McCall&#39;s annual budget sits at less than &pound;2m, which highlights the excellent work of the manager as well as the gap in resource between Scottish football&#39;s leading clubs.<br><br>Motherwell duly played their part in an even, if flat, opening half. Charlie Mulgrew slammed a shot only narrowly wide of the visiting goal after 14 minutes, with Hooper only inches away from latching on to a rebound from Motherwell&#39;s goalkeeper Darren Randolph shortly after. A Celtic penalty claim, seconds before the interval, looked to have merit as Tim Clancy handled.<br><br>The breakthrough Celtic had increasingly threatened arrived within 15 minutes of the restart. The Motherwell defending &ndash; which had otherwise been somewhat combative &ndash; was chronically lax in allowing Georgios Samaras to chest an Adam Matthews throw-in right to Hooper. The striker, completely unmarked, drilled home a low finish without, for whatever reason, offering any form of celebration at all. Hooper was more animated when denied by a Shaun Hutchinson tackle, five minutes later.<br><br>By this stage, Motherwell were offering precious little in attack. Henrik Ojamaa went to desperate levels to change that, the Estonian rightly booked for a blatant dive inside the Celtic penalty area.<br><br>Celtic never came particularly close to doubling their lead. There was never any strong sense that they needed to. A Lennon tantrum over a dubious offside flag &ndash; Samaras seemed to be in his own half when a pass was played to him &ndash; was the most newsworthy act of the closing stages. The manager is not lacking in impetus; Celtic&#39;s results prove the same applies to his players.  <br><br><h2>Hooper strikes as Celtic keep winning</h2> 	                                    By: Laura Brannan on 25 Feb, 2012 16:52, Celticfc.net<br>February 25, 2012<br>Scottish Premier League<br>Celtic Park<br><br>CELTIC 1<br>(Hooper 59)<br><br>MOTHERWELL 0<br><br>GARY  Hooper&rsquo;s close-range strike, just before the hour mark, was enough to  seal the victory against Motherwell at Celtic Park, extending the Hoops&rsquo;  lead at the top of the table to 23 points.<br><br>The striker took his  tally to 20 goalsfor the season as Celtic made it 20consecutive wins  in all three domestic competitions, including 17 in the SPL. It was a  run which began when they last faced Motherwell at the start of  November.<br><br>The Steelmen put in a strong and stubborn performance,  but the home side dominated in the wet conditions, and sealed a  hard-fought victory.<br><br>Neil Lennon made five changes to the side  which defeated Dunfermline midweek. Adam Matthews and Thomas Rogne  returned to the backline and James Forrest and Georgios Samaras provided  fresh attacking options. Victor Wanyama, meanwhile, replaced the  injured Scott Brown.<br><br>In his skipper&rsquo;s absence, Charlie Mulgrew  took over the captain&rsquo;s armband, and looking to build on his outstanding  strike on Wednesday, he came close to opening the scoring on 15  minutes, firing a low effort just wide of the post, from inside the  penalty area.<br><br>But Motherwell, with genuine aspirations of  finishing second int he SPL, made it difficult for the home side to  break them down and provided their own attacking threat.<br><br>The  Hoops were looking dangerous on the attack, though, and as the  first-half progressed, they grew in confidence. Ki came close with two  free-kicks shortly before half-time. The first was knocked wide for a  corner while the second forced Darren Randolph into an impressive save.<br><br>It  wasn&rsquo;t enough to break the deadlock before the break, and even though  the second-half started in a similar style, Celtic were finally able to  open the scoring just before the hour mark. <br><br>Anthony Stokes was  introduced to play on 59 minutes but it was his strike partner, Hooper,  who stuck the ball away only seconds later. Samaras collected Matthews&rsquo;  throw-in andchested the ball to Hooper&rsquo;s feet. The Englishman blasted  it home from just six yards out, putting his side into the lead.<br><br>Thatopened  the gameup and while Celtic were looking stronger with the one-goal  advantage, it also encouraged Motherwell to start attacking the Hoops&rsquo;  backline. <br><br>Ki came close with another effort on target before  Forrest&rsquo;s low drive was turned around the far post on 71 minutes. Just  60 seconds before that, Henrick Ojamaa broke into the penalty box, but  went down easily and was booked for diving.<br><br>As the clock entered  the last five minutes, Motherwell continued to seek an equaliser, but  Celtic had made a defensive substitution, replacing Hooper with Cha Du  Ri, and looked solid and well worth the lead.<br><br>Samaras was  controversially ruled offside late into stoppage time, before Stokes  made a break on goal, but it didn&rsquo;t make a difference to the final score  as the victory was already secured.<br><br>CELTIC (4-4-2): Forster;  Matthews, K.

For Celtic, it was a 14th straight win in all competitions and their 17th in the SPL. <br>    Home manager Neil Lennon again rang the changes as he  looked to keep his players fresh with the title all but won after  reigning champions Rangers were docked 10 points for going into  administration. <br>    Adam Matthews, Thomas Rogne, Victor Wanyama, James  Forrest and Georgios Samaras came in for Cha Du-ri, Emilio Izaguirre,  Kris Commons, Anthony Stokes and captain Scott Brown, who has a groin  injury. <br>    Motherwell, looking for their third win in eight days,  made only one change, with captain Keith Lasley returning from  suspension to replace Omar Daley in midfield as manager Stuart McCall  vowed to attack the leaders. <br>    But it was Celtic who started where they left off  against Dunfermline in midweek, dominating possession and Tom Hateley,  goalkeeper Darren Randolph and Stevie Hammell were all forced into  making important early interceptions for the visitors.                                        Charlie Mulgrew was full of confidence in a week when  he followed his inclusion in the Scotland squad by being named Celtic  captain for the day. <br>    He loped forward and set up Samaras before firing wide  after the striker&#39;s own effort rebounded back into the defender&#39;s path  off Hateley. <br>    The pair combined again moments later and the Greek&#39;s  shot was cleared at the second attempt by Randolph as the goalkeeper  juggled the striker&#39;s effort. <br>    Another Hateley block denied Samaras at the back post  after Matthew&#39;s cross found the head of the striker, whose effort on the  rebound was also deflected for a corner. <br>    Motherwell survived the pressure but were finding it  impossible to create chances of their own and Ki Sung-Yueng came close  with a drive that flew just wide of the visitors&#39; goal. <br>    A Ki free-kick gave Kelvin Wilson a great chance to  open the scoring from eight yards, but the defender headed straight at  Randolph. <br>    Stokes came on for Wanyama after the break and the  change appeared to disrupt Motherwell&#39;s concentration as they poorly  defended a long throw chested down by Samaras into the path of Hooper,  who scored with clinical precision. <br>    Randolph saved well to deny Hooper as he looked for a quickfire double after again being set up by Samaras. <br>    The Motherwell goalkeeper did well again to save from close range after Forrest threatened on the break. <br>    Motherwell&#39;s in-form striker, Henrik Ojamaa, at last  had a sniff at goal and perhaps would should have done better than fire  straight at Fraser Forster as the visitors at last tested the  goalkeeper. <br>    Steve Jennings also fired disappointingly wide as  Motherwell missed a chance to move level on points with Rangers, who  face Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Sunday. <br><br><h2>Live Text Commentary<br></h2>  Live Text Commentary<br>90:00 +3:06<br><br>The final whistle is blown by the referee.<br>90:00 +2:09<br><br>Steve Jennings gives away a free kick for an unfair challenge on Georgios Samaras.

This year&#39;s title is yours and even though I believe it&#39;s tainted that&#39;s none of your concern.<br>It&#39;s not Celtic&#39;s fault Rangers have ended up in a mess of their own making.<br>So Neil Lennon and his players have every right to milk the moment from here on in until the medals are passed around in May.<br>The club&#39;s supporters are also entitled to enjoy the rest of the cakewalk.<br><br>I&#39;d prefer just to leave them to it. Congratulate them and move on. I just wish they had the good grace to do likewise as my club attempts to battle for its very existence and good people are worried sick about their jobs.<br>I find the tone that has been set by the men at the top at Celtic Park in recent days and weeks has been ill-judged at best and, at worst, deliberately inflammatory.<br>Let&#39;s be honest here, Rangers are lying in the gutter, bleeding badly. There is no need for the likes of Lennon and Peter Lawwell to continue to sink the boot in when our wounds<br>have been self-inflicted.<br>I would hope Rangers, as a football club, would conduct themselves with a bit more class if the shoe was on the other foot. In fact, I&#39;m sure they would.<br>Calling for Rangers to be stripped of titles? Political manipulating and manoeuvring in order to make sure no mercy is shown should their rivals get back on their feet?<br>All this crass stuff about celebrating the death of Rangers with bowls of jelly and ice cream? Is that really necessary? It smacks of the behaviour of people who hate Rangers more than they love their own club. It reflects very badly on them all.<br>No one expects Celtic to shed a tear over the state Rangers have got themselves into.<br>But, even so, there is a venom about their recent reaction which has shocked me and should embarrass the more level-headed, decent people at Parkhead. I hope it does at any rate.<br>It saddens me that these extreme times seem to bring out the worst in supporters on both sides of Glasgow.<br>I include Rangers supporters in that because last week, when they were all hurting so badly, some of them chose to bring further shame on Ibrox by singing the kind of songs that have been making us cringe for so long. Thanks for that lads. Just what the club needed in a time of crisis.<br>As much as I would prefer for Celtic to concentrate on enjoying their success, I would also hope Rangers and their fans can act with dignity and decorum as they fight to get through this, one of the most horrible periods in the club&#39;s 140-year history.<br>These are the qualities the club was built on and these same qualities have never been more important than they are right now.<br>In fact, I&#39;d go as far as to say how the Rangers support acts at this crucial juncture may decide the very fate of their club.<br>It&#39;s time for them to think smart. Singing stupid songs of defiance is hardly what&#39;s needed now. They have to take a step back from all that nonsense and attempt to get a clear view of the bigger picture.<br>It&#39;s not about mindless bravado, it&#39;s about making the right choices and ensuring the club they love is around another 140 years from now.<br>There is no shame in being duped. Let&#39;s be honest, it happens to us all.<br>But what&#39;s the old saying? Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.<br>They should have those words engraved on the front doors of Ibrox as a permanent reminder and a warning to the next man who gets his hands on the keys.<br>Yes, the Rangers support is just about to realise how powerful it really is now it is galvanised again and pulling in the same direction.<br>These fans are about to become the king makers and that&#39;s why they should behave in a manner befitting the club they represent.<br>The next man who steps up to the plate will expect them to scrutinise his every move like never before. The fans will demand that, from now on, the people at the top are open and transparent. They deserve nothing less.<br>What the future holds is still unclear. In the short term, we can only hope the administrators find what they are looking for to keep the business going and then had it over to a safe pair of hands.<br>Hopefully the time will come soon when the fans are being asked to throw their united support behind a new regime.<br>In an ideal world a group of well meaning, wealthy and reputable Rangers supporters will step forward to claim control as a consortium to make sure that, never again, the club is left in the hands of just one man.<br>If all these interested parties can find a way to club together for the greater good and drag Rangers away from the brink I&#39;m positive the rank and file won&#39;t be slow in identifying them as the men who saved them from their darkest hour.<br>It&#39;s time for Rangers men to stand up and be counted. It&#39;s time for the club to rid itself of all the old unwanted baggage so that Rangers can be proud of itself again for the fantastic football club it always has been.<br>So let Celtic get on with celebrating their title - a title they somehow failed to win throughout the last three years of financial troubles - and let Rangers get on with the painful process of putting their club back together.<br><br><br><br>Neil Lennon<br>The Sun<br><a class="external" href="http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/4154836/Lennon-in-title-blast-at-Hateley.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/4154836/Lennon-in-title-blast-at-Hateley.html</a><br><br><br>NEIL LENNON last night slated Rangers legend Mark Hateley and branded him an EMBARRASSMENT.<br> comment on this story 0 comment<br> <br> The Celtic boss was seething over a bitter rant from Hateley against him and his champions-elect.<br> <br> The ex-Gers striker slammed Lennon and the Hoops hierarchy for making what he called &#39;inflammatory&#39; comments about administration-hit Rangers.<br> <br> Lenny was fuming at what he reckoned was Hateley branding Celtic&#39;s likely title win &#39;tainted&#39; because of Gers&#39; worries.<br> <br> Lennon and Hoops chief Peter Lawwell spoke out strongly on Gers&#39; downfall and the gaffer stands by their words. He said: &quot;Mark&#39;s brought this up two weeks after we&#39;ve done the interviews, so why he&#39;s bringing it up now, I don&#39;t know. I find it embarrassing.<br> <br> &quot;It caused a lot of amusement among us. At the end of last season I said there were a lot of people outside the game who don&#39;t put anything constructive into it. It&#39;s just take, take, take.<br> <br> &quot;And Mark, I&#39;d put into that bracket. I don&#39;t know where he&#39;s coming from with his comments about us dancing on Rangers&#39; grave. That is completely misconstrued.<br> <br> &quot;In his opening paragraph he basically says &#39;I don&#39;t care what you think, but your title&#39;s tainted&#39;. To me that&#39;s disrespectful and inflammatory to the supporters of this club, the club itself and certainly my players.<br> <br> &quot;Basically it&#39;s just PUB talk. Someone in his position should know better.<br> <br> &quot;So if anybody&#39;s being inflammatory about the whole situation it&#39;s him.<br> <br> &quot;We&#39;d still be well clear without Rangers being in administration and the ten-point penalty.&quot;<br> <br> Lennon added: &quot;Hateley is someone who has played the game and should know the game.<br> <br> &quot;We&#39;ve never mentioned dancing on Rangers&#39; grave at all. We haven&#39;t taken a gloating theme to it.<br> <br> &quot;He&#39;s using the words dignity and class &mdash; well Rangers are the ones under investigation.<br> <br> &quot;They&#39;re the ones who the police have been called in to look at.<br> <br> &quot;We&#39;ve done nothing wrong. We&#39;ve played the game on the pitch as honestly as we can &mdash; and off the pitch we do our business properly. It was a cheap shot from Hateley.<br> <br> &quot;Our fans won&#39;t take a blind bit of notice of what Mark says or thinks. And neither will we.&quot;  <br></div>
