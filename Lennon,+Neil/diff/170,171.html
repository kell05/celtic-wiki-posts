It was to be his <span class="diffAdd">entire </span>being from that point onwards. His funnily bleach blond hair made him look <span class="diffAdd">at first </span>a little comical and masked the true fighter underneath it all.   <br><br>Signed by Martin O&#39;Neill as a holding midfielder, his presence on the pitch was meant to bolster the defensive aspect of the team and cover for the more attack minded players and do the unglamorous defensive roles in the middle of the park. As it happened, this was all turned on its head, and he himself needed the club and fans to cover for himself off the pitch. There have been far fewer players in our club&#39;s history who have been as victimised as Neil Lennon by others, and his struggle to just be able to live his life has been a difficult one. <br><br>The strange thing is that much of this write-up will be about anything apart from what was on the pitch! Surprising, as there is a hell of a lot to say for what happened on the pitch as off it. He was a talented midfielder, but having taken on a more defensive holding role in the side (reflected in that he only scored three goals for us in seven years) he was one for the more avid fan to be able to understand and appreciate than anyone else. Football is a team game and not just about the goalscorers, and every great side needs players like <span class="diffAdd">Neil </span>Lennon who do the graft work that gives the space for the others to score the goals.<br><br>Arriving in Dec 2000, Celtic had already got off well from the starting blocks with Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill (who was also his former manager at Leicester), and Lennon was brought in to build on the early success the team at that point was enjoying. Slotting into the Celtic side, he gave the attacking players a bit more comfort that he was behind them to assist, and effectively allowed <span class="diffRemove">us</span><span class="diffAdd">the team</span> to be more daring in attack than if he wasn&#39;t there. Many people who only watch matches on TV don&#39;t understand the work that is done on the pitch by some players off the ball, and there were few players who worked as hard as Neil Lennon <span class="diffRemove">off</span><span class="diffAdd">in</span> <span class="diffRemove">the</span><span class="diffAdd">this</span> <span class="diffRemove">ball.</span><span class="diffAdd">area.</span> Some Celtic fans could find him frustrating as he was not averse to playing the ball back to the defence but in the course of a 90min game this is intelligent play, and you can&#39;t just attack at all times (possession is key).<br><br>One initial issue was a potential clash with fans&#39; favourite Paul Lambert. Both played similar roles and it was thought this would create problems, but this was back in the day when having having more than one holding midfielder would have been seen as a luxury or excessive. Regardless, <span class="diffAdd">Martin </span>O&#39;Neill re-jigged the midfield and all fitted into place.<br><br>His time at Celtic was marked with success, and two league titles in his first two years was excellent but the Road to Seville season (2002-03) was one of the greatest highlights. As with others, he was well overshadowed by Larsson, Sutton and the goal scorers, but he never complained and got on with his job. Needling players to defend from the midfield, compete for the ball and cover for the others, he more than showed his value, and it was sad to see players like himself being on the losing side in the UEFA Cup when they deserved so much more. Having played throughout the bulk of Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s tenure at Celtic, his favoured place will be assured with the other more lauded players during that golden period.<br><br>As a reflection of his importance to the team and the club, he was made captain of the side in 2005, a well-earned accolade. It was also a measure of his dedication to the side.<br><br>He did state that if we had achieved going through the group stages in the Champions League then that would count for more than the UEFA Cup Final (something the Huns liked to bring up when they achieved the feat first), and in 2006 his face was full of joy as the interviewer informed him that <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span> had qualified to the knock-out stages after defeating Man U 1-0. There are few other players for whom you could have felt as happy for.<br><br>As happens too often, Lennon stayed a season longer than he probably <span class="diffAdd">he </span>should have at Celtic. His pace was slowing down making him less effective in his position, and in turn he became too easy a target for the moaners (they need a target to keep themselves occupied). Nevertheless, he captained the side to the league title for the second year in a row and he never gave less than his all. <br><br>At his last game for the club (as a player) he gave a farewell thank you speech. However, the travelling Aberdeen fans were giving him lip throughout his speech, and so he politely requested for the &quot;<i>sheep shaggers</i>&quot; to be quiet for a minute. All in jest, and in fairness the Aberdeen fans didn&#39;t take the hump. <span class="diffRemove">Funnily</span><span class="diffAdd">Fun &amp; cheeky</span> <span class="diffRemove">controversial</span><span class="diffAdd">ending</span> to <span class="diffRemove">the</span><span class="diffAdd">his</span> <span class="diffRemove">end</span><span class="diffAdd">playing</span> <span class="diffRemove">our</span><span class="diffAdd">day</span> <span class="diffRemove">Lenny</span><span class="diffAdd">for Lennon</span> (and <span class="diffRemove">we</span><span class="diffAdd">the Celtic support</span> love him for it).

The simple answer is that he was a Roman Catholic Irish man who studied at St.Micheal&#39;s Grammar school, was raised in Northern Ireland, and then chose to sign for Celtic. Myths, lies and propaganda then were fabricated about him by the Huns and other in-bred fans from other Scottish clubs to supposedly justify (sic!) their barracking of him. Whole spates of non-incidents followed him as most people seemed to form delusions to try to convince themselves that Lennon was a bigot (not that he ever did or say anything bigoted to supposedly demonstrate that he was).   <br><br>Notable was his departure from the N Ireland squad. He had to endure abuse at Windsor Park for having signed for Celtic - death threats were made against him and his family by Loyalist terrorists - and it led to his decision to have to prematurely end his international career. On choosing a political football XI, Simon Kuper (a respected international football journalist) chose Neil Lennon to be represented in the side due to the Northern Ireland incidents. Bigots had beaten him in in Ulster, but they weren&#39;t to defeat him in Scotland, yet they still made his life difficult and it was a challenge.<br><br>Bigoted abuse was relentless against Lennon, clearly showing that there were still many in Scotland who were stuck in the cesspits of the 17th Century. One episode happened at the end of a game against Rangers, where Neil Lennon went up to the Rangers fans and made a mock sign of smoking a cigar (you can take from what you want). What did they claim? They claimed that he spat at them (!) and that he made sectarian remarks. A set of Huns even got out a lip reader to try and &quot;prove&quot; this (they couldn&#39;t) and how someone was supposed to hear and witness him supposedly from so far away is not possible, and it just shows the low levels the Huns were willing to go to try to blacken Lennon&#39;s name. It was all a bizarre fantasy in their heads and it was all just a disgrace.<br><br>The whole bigotry against Lennon matter came to a head in November 2004, when after a torrid time in another game against Rangers, Martin O&#39;Neill defiantly took Lennon back onto the pitch, and he went to the Celtic support to show his support and backing after Lennon had endured an afternoon of &quot;racial and sectarian abuse&quot;. Papers wrote full write-ups on the events, and Graham Speirs (a respected journalist) later noted in a book he wrote that this shook David Murray (Hun&#39;s chairman) to act more decisively on the issue in fear of UEFA repercussions. The way that Martin O&#39;Neill handled it was brave and deserving of respect, and both he and Neil Lennon had become reluctant heroes in this respect.<br><br>In all honesty, Neil Lennon was no angel. In one incident at the end of a match, he even ended up in a spat with fellow team mate Aiden McGeady. It was more handbags at ten paces but was a ridiculous spectacle. The problem was that he was just an over emotional guy. In a frank admission, he admitted later to having had serious problems with depression, but he has had the strength to speak about it publicly and hopefully other footballers can learn from his experiences. In any case, even when Lennon did go awry it was never offensive let alone sectarian. <br><br>In years to come Lennon&#39;s time at Celtic will be seen as an important point in the whole divide issue. Celtic have always been an open club - though not denying a handful of events that have gone against our ethos over the years - and Neil Lennon&#39;s treatment by other Scottish clubs&#39; fans really showed that the country have many who are deaf, dumb or blind to reality, and this was notable even amongst various pockets of people who weren&#39;t just Rangers fans. Lennon stuck through it all and we stuck by him. That more than anything else is a real measure of success of Lennon&#39;s time as a player at Celtic. <br><br>We wish that it would have been possible to have just been able to talk about his performances on the pitch. However, when the next player comes from a similar background to Lennon&#39;s and he does not have to go through what Neil Lennon went through, then it will be time to happily reflect on the real victory for the Celtic ethos and on Lennon&#39;s part in this change. <br><br>However, matters were to get even worse when he became our manager with the bigots going into overdrive, with the press heavily pandering to them. Absolute disgrace.<br><h3>  </h3>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Celtic Coach &amp; Manager (2010-14)<font size="2"><img align="right" alt="Lennon, Neil - Pic" height="288" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/zYA3fjz2nCSakIYCW4CLtA27080/GW460H288" title="Lennon, Neil - Pic" width="460"></font></h3>In 2008, following Tommy Burn&#39;s stepping down due to illness, Neil Lennon was appointed to the Coaching Staff (under Gordon Strachan), and very welcome he was too. It was a successful move as we won the league in incredible nail-biting style, but the next season was a disaster and Gordon Strachan left at the end of it all.   <br><br>In March 2010, he was appointed as the interim manager after Tony Mowbray was sacked after a long line of failings on the pitch. It was a turnaround for Lennon. Despite being said to be a popular coach amongst the players, stories abounded on the forums of some poor treatment and sidelining by the Tony Mowbray &amp; Peter Grant regime, which didn&#39;t go well with the general support. The whole story isn&#39;t fully known to be fair to Mowbray &amp; Grant, but the stories helped to fuel Lennon&#39;s popularity with the aggrieved support. <br><br>Anyhow, now in charge temporarily the question is how he was to handle the transition. A brave start with some good wins turned things, only to see it crash as we were knocked out by lowly Ross County in the Scottish Cup. It was embarrassing, and the players had let Lennon down. The result wasn&#39;t his fault, and the damage from previous regime was beginning to destroy things. He let the players clearly know his feelings:<br><br><blockquote>  <i>&ldquo;See projects? Forget it. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing it. I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about two- and three-year plans. I don&rsquo;t buy into it. It&rsquo;s about now. You don&rsquo;t have time as a Celtic or Rangers manager. Projects are something my daughter does at school. I&rsquo;m a football man, only interested in results, performances and players. I don&rsquo;t care about two years&rsquo; time. I might not bloody be here.&rdquo;</i><br></blockquote><br>On 9 June 2010, Neil Lennon was confirmed as the manager of Celtic. In truth, there wasn&#39;t a long list of candidates for the job. Scottish Football was at a low and the club could neither afford or entice a big name manager from England or the Continent to come on board. However, that is no slight on Lennon. A good spell in charge meant he was a fair choice, but in truth there was a large degree of scepticism taking in account his short experience in coaching and lack of prep for management.<br><br><b>2010-11</b><br>However, in his first full season in charge Lennon would galvanise the support by producing an entertaining and winning team. The campaign took a while to get going and after early disappointments in Europe the team took a little while to gel. But his signings - particularly Izaguirre, Hooper, Ledley and Kayal - were on the whole superb acquisitions and by the start of the new year the Bhoys were in impressive form. <br><br>Ultimately though the season will forever be overshadowed by the shocking treatment of Lennon by some sick sections of Scottish society. Bullets, death threats, bombs and assaults would all ensure Lenny was never far from the front page.<br><br>Sadly, although there were a few examples of excellent reporting of the issues at hand, some in the media were far from innocent in this whole shameful saga. Ever eager to vilify Lennon, mostly for simply doing his job, some reporters added fuel to the fire. The Celtic manager was regularly and severely criticised for speaking out about referees, and reacting to provocation from the likes of Ally McCoist and El Hadj Diouf. Meanwhile other managers - such as Craig Brown - were all but ignored for behaviour far worse than that displayed by Neil Lennon. <br><br>On the pitch Celtic would fall short of claiming the title with Rangers taking another tainted championship. It was hard to take for a team who had played the best football in Scotland and which had frequently dominated the Ibrox side in encounters. But there was some consolation when the Bhoys claimed the Scottish Cup with a 3-0 win over Motherwell at Hampden.<br><br>It should have been a better season, but Celtic let it slip yet there were signs of progress, and hope for a better challenge next season.<br><br><b>2011-12</b><br>Season 2010-11 saw Celtic make considerable progress under Neil Lennon and there is considerable confidence about the season ahead. That confidence was underlined on June 20th 2011 when Lenny was awarded a lucrative new 12 month rolling contract.<br><br>If you were to describe the 2011-12 season to anyone for Neil Lennon, then it would be best said that it was a season that no script-writer could necessarily beat. It was an emotional and topsy-turvy season that saw Lennon plumb the depths of despair to rise again and claim the SPL crown for the first time. <br><br>Unlike the previous season where Lennon was given the benefit of the doubt as he was a rookie manager and due to the off-field circumstances, there was less leeway this time. Against the Huns who had a rookie manager, we were favourites and many felt we were to cruise it. Things aren&rsquo;t always as easy as that, and that&rsquo;s what proved to be the case.<br><br>Domestically, after a fair but unconvincing start, we hit a rut which deepened over the coming months. The good form from last season was deserting the team, although injuries weren&rsquo;t helping. The team were poor to watch and Lennon&rsquo;s team was clearly not managing tactics well. The Huns despite being bereft of any talent, pulled ahead by an incredible 15pts by end-Nov (albeit playing two games in hand). It was an embarrassment and opinion on Lennon&rsquo;s judgement and management were at rock bottom. There were few if any apologists, but most importantly the most patient were the board members who stuck by him even though most fans were of the opinion that it was all over for him.<br><br>One game stick out the most. First was the 3-3 match with Kilmarnock. The fans were heated over Lennon, and this match was a hoped for respite. Yet by half-time in an abject display we were amazingly 3-0 down! A fight-back led by Stokes and Mulgrew amazingly brought us within a hairs breadth of a victory but 3-3 was a fine and undeserved result. However, the support little celebrated the result, it being more two points dropped. Lennon admitted himself later that at half-time that he though it was all over. It didn&rsquo;t appear to be an aberration either to many.<br><br>As for the press, the Daily Record had nailed it&rsquo;s colours to the mast early on, and little difference from elsewhere. After wrongly disallowing a fair goal by Wilson in the opening match, they ran a back page story twisting Lennon&rsquo;s words and making a mountain out of a molehill. The paper was in the wrong and portrayed him out to be a walking timebomb. It was out of order but an early reminder of the underhand agenda that many outwith of the club had against Lennon. An easy target for too many and the support&rsquo;s backing was vital. There was little better from there on in.<br><br>Away from Scotland, in Europe, a disastrous early season saw Celtic out of Europe in the UEFA Cup qualifiers embarrassingly only to be re-instated by UEFA after FC Sion played ineligible players. Despite the reprieve it didn&rsquo;t help Lennon&rsquo;s reputation. The criticisms of his being tactically inept were gathering steam having lost against poor opposition. <br><br>Things were to change, not rapidly but they did. The league was believed to be over, and without the pressure the players played far better and began an incredible run of wins. At the same time the Huns began to slump and by the time of the match in the Dec game, our victory meant we&rsquo;d leapfrogged them. Lennon was deserving of the praise having turned the side around! After all the criticism (much from even the Celtic support), he didn&rsquo;t walk away or make excuses. He galvanised the players and we were now on top. We stayed that way from then on in to take the title. <br><br>Back in Europe, we didn&rsquo;t qualify from our Europa League group. A poor start saw the team re-group and pull some great performances out the hat. It was a good learning curve for all. Lennon we hoped would have picked up a lot.<br><br>For Lennon, he was bringing through the players, they were all behind him. The performances were getting better and he was increasingly getting the hand of management. Problematically, he admitted that he didn&rsquo;t bother with tactics. Na&iuml;ve and daft comment and if true then it didn&rsquo;t bode too well, and in the cups this showed, where we lost to Kilmarnock in a poor performance in the league cup final and then lost to Hearts in the Semi-final of the Scottish Cup. For a side that was coasting the league, it was baffling how we&rsquo;d succumbed so poorly in the cups. We thought we&rsquo;d win the treble, but Lennon was satisfied with the league at least. However it still brought out concerns over his managerial ability. Why were we still losing crunch games? <br><br>Lennon could take a lot from this season. It was also the collapse of Rangers on and off-field that will privately give Lennon the most satisfaction after the league title.<br><br>Must add that off-field, matter were as hard as ever. The Huns &amp; Press continued to press Lennon as being some kind of villain. He wasn&rsquo;t. He was no better or worse than others. It was deflection from the Huns&rsquo; predicament. Pathetic.<br><br>Additionally, Lennon had to manage after the unexpected death of a lawyer friend who had also been sent a potential explosive device the previous season. The court case was difficult for Lennon but saw the defendants jailed for their actions. Lennon had to later sack friend and colleague Alan Thompson at the end of the season due to Thompson&#39;s personal problems impinging on his role. A difficult move.<br><br>Moving forward, Lennon had to show mettle and tactical nous. His apprenticeship was over. Tactics brought us down previously and the support wanted to be ahead on this balance for a change. He&rsquo;d done well with transfers and it was hoped this was to continue. The young squad was maturing and needed a hand to take the club to the next level.<br><br>It was a brave new world with Rangers gone now for Scottish Football. Question for Celtic, how will Lennon adjust to the change with the main rivals gone?<br><br><b>2012-13</b><br>This was to be quite a transitional year for Lennon. He&#39;d lost his right hand man Alan Thompson (sacked!) but strictly he was no longer a novice in his role. The removal of the burdens of the oldco Rangers games was a bonus, and meant the new environment was a fresh start for all. It was a time to prove himself. <br><br>The main opinion across Scottish football pre season was that we would fail in Europe miserably but lord it all domestically. Little ever goes as predicted, and incredibly European football became the grand theatre for the first team with plenty of great performances to remember forever. <br><br>Leading the team into the KO stages of the European Cup, and thus becoming the first person to have done so as both a Celtic player and Celtic manager, was exceptional especially when you take it relative to the financial resources to counterparts in Spain, England and Italy. <br><br>Attention must turn to Lennon&#39;s new methods. Rightly he deserved criticism in previous seasons for tactics and results in key matches. It was a steep learning curve and he&#39;d conquered it. This European campaign had buried numerous concerns and he deserved the credit from it. With relatively limited options (financially) to his peers in European competition, his staff had to gauge how to tackle the opposition. As the Barcelona matches showed he and his team had managed those tasks. They&#39;d managed to formulate and apply tactics that were not simply dull ten men behind the ball extreme cattanacio defending. It was great to watch, and received praise even from esteemed football tactics journalist/analyst Jonathan Wilson. <br><br>Was this really the manager who was only a year back three down at half time v Kilmarnock in the league and seeing the end of his Celtic managerial career? Yes it was! Probably no other Celtic manager has ever seen as swift a turnaround in their fortunes. It was Boys&#39; Own stuff and let&#39;s be honest, startling! <br><br>However in contrast the domestic situation was different, and results at Parkhead early in the season were concerning with the performances to match: dull with the scorelines to back it up. Kilmarnock even managed their first victory at Celtic Park in 50 years. It wasn&#39;t until around January when we finally showed our steel and quality to push well in front of the rest and finally claim the league by a mile. The end of our European chances following the 3-0 defeat by Juventus, put the focus back to the domestic challenge, and we began to thump sides with some great performances. The odd hiccup still also along the way with Lennon willing to lambaste the first team publicly after any unacceptable performances. <br><br>Question marks were raised again after the defeat by Ross County in the league, but some were bottling their angst for a while. The league was over, and Lennon will have been disappointed in some performances but the trajectory is right. With the room to manoeuvre he was doing the right thing in being experimental with some players and youngsters. That would mean short term pain for long term benefits we&#39;d hope. However, when matters turned as occurred with three defeats in a row in March, then pragmatically there was a reversal in ideas. <br><br>In any case, we still won the league by a mile despite any faltering displays and we were happy. Lennon had driven the first team to the title and this marathon was a great success. Two in a row. <br><br>The domestic cups were a mixed picture going out early and poorly to St Mirren in the league cup. However, a recovery pushed us to the Scottish Cup final, and an all green day v Hibs. Celtic triumphed easily, and Lennon had made a name for himself. He had become only the third Celt to have won both the league and cup double as both player and manager. It was a tremendous season for him. Some wondered if we had a Hampden hoodoo, as Lennon has had an erratic record at Hampden. Well, we won the Scottish Cup so forget the rest. <br><br>One impact of his success followed fast after the retirement of Alex Ferguson at Man U. They nicked ex Celt David Moyes from Everton, and Lennon became the favourite for the vacant role. A sure sign of his growing reputation. <br><br>Not all appreciated him. Lennon actually thought the media would give him some respect, The Sun blew this out the water by twisting comments on Sevco made by him in another interview, with a matching snarling picture to boot. It was disturbing after past experience that they&#39;d try something like this. It was becoming ridiculously common for any quotes to be pictured with a snarling picture of him. It was pathetic. Some things were to never change. In contrast the empathy for the flailing McCoist at Newco Huns was pathetic and the press was applauding his incompetence, whilst Lennon kept being represented negatively. <br><br>Lennon generally took it in his stride, and at one point just swatted away the media in a tweet, and demonstrated a simple way to handle them. It was a great season for him, far greater than any of us could have hoped for and the media (no matter how hard they tried) were not going to ruin it for him. Stories on a devalued title as no Sevco and the like were just laughed off. <br><br>It was overall a great season in Europe and a successful campaign at home. He could more than hold his head up high. Yet some concerns still remained but lesser so than in previous seasons but the turnaround to the next season was to be quick so little summer respite for the coaches. <br><br><b>2013-14</b><br>Lennon was to start the season in some ways as if he was at a new club. There may not have been a clear out of players, but we&#39;d lost the backbone of our side: the best defender (Wilson), the best midfielder (Wanyama) and the best striker (Hooper) were all transferred out. Good money in but difficult to get new people into the SPL. <br><br>Domestically, the general script was very good in the league. Despite some shakey performances now and again, the team was set out well with an adequate rotation of player to compensate for any losses. The only issue that Lennon had heavily failed in was strikers. A bugbear in recent years, it had accumulated to the shambles of this season. A long bench of strikers with not reliable to score any goals. Kris Commons was bailing them out but this wasn&#39;t good enough. Lee Griffiths turned things around and made some of the old guard look pathetic. <br><br>The early exit from the league cup meant that again we&#39;d not win the coveted treble, despite our advantages. Still, after some online and in pub hoo-haas, it was quickly forgotten, yet again it was another case of &#39;<i>What If?</i>&#39;. The players were more at fault for the exit than Lennon. <br><br>However this was repeated later in the Scottish Cup after Celtic embarrassed themselves being knocked out early. Admittedly it was to a resurgent Aberdeen but it wasn&#39;t good enough. Early predictions of a treble was looking nowlike hubris. It was more than achievable but we&#39;d not even got going on that front. <br><br>It was no easy season, probably best defined as going one step back from last. Lennon deserved credit for the league title (never in doubt and a very consistent performance) , and the resurgence in the defence was down to the skill of Lennon&#39;s coaching team in spotting talent and rearing them well. The long spell of clean sheets tat saw records broken was fantastic, and credit where credit was due. It was great to watch. <br><br>Teams in Scotland were adapting to the new environment and building strongly, although Hearts were collapsing under their debts (and were later relegated).<br><br>Europe was mixed. Lennon stuttered often. Getting through the qualifiers by the skin of our teeth was nervous enough. However a tough group on paper turned out to be less so in practise, yet despite getting tactics right in the first three game and putting out sides that made a fist for things we still lost two matches. The final run of group matches saw Lennon make a hash of tactics (especially Ajax away) and Celtic collapsed to the bottom of the group. No replication of the luck from last season, and the critics were out in force.<br><br>On the other hand, it was no easy time. With our resources an the squad always in flux, we have to expect highs and lows. Lennon at least never threw in the towel. <br><br>He didn&#39;t do well with tactics more often that should be the case, and the cup defeats and losses in Europe showed that maybe he needed to revise his preparation methods for pressure knock-out matches. The tactical shambles against Ajax away against a side who were there for the taking was symptomatic of the problems that Celtic have create themselves. Tactics wise we&#39;d regressed and needed to a look again at our books. Smaller sides took playing against Celtic in the cups as if the matches were like the final itself, so unlike at some points in the past, the cup games were no longer something that could be taken for gratned.<br><br>Transfers were a mixed bag. The wonderful success of van Dijk and Johansen overshadowed all else, but the forwards were a joke. An issue for Lennon to rectify. Still on balance did well with transfers and pushing the squad he had. Youngsters could have been bled more in the season, but sending them out to prove themselves was likely a good move too. That way the can show if they&#39;re worth the chance or not on their return. <br><br>So criticism in some areas was warranted but Lennon didn&#39;t take it all well:<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind criticism if it is constructive &ndash; but sometimes it is venomous. And you think that is not an environment conducive to thriving, it really isn&rsquo;t. I have respect for most of the journalists in this country but I was looking at forums, hotlines and phone-ins. It really sucks the life out of you at times.&rdquo; Lennon Sep 2013</i><br></blockquote><br>The media relationship was generally frayed. Lennon didn&#39;t help matters admittedly by complaining of bias and disrespect to the club by the media and online, including ITV. Truth in what he said but probably a better way to deal with it offline and behind closed doors. <br><br>As for progress off the field, sadly Scottish football was still stuck in the dark ages. In Feb 2014, sadly the scumbags in Scottish football returned. Visiting the Aberdeen v St Johnstone League cup semi-final, he was spat at and had coins thrown at him by certain Aberdeen fans sitting around him (the match was at the neutral Tynecastle). Lennon had to leave after 70mins of the game. Deplorable and disgusting what happened. Thankfully most Aberdeen fans agreed that this was wholly unacceptable. <br><br>He&#39;d won the league now three seasons in a row. A wonderful achievement, but then to the surprise of many, <span class="diffAdd">Neil </span>Lennon resigned on 22 May 2014. His assistant (Johan Mjallby) had left only recently, and there were some rumours of Lennon&#39;s eminent departure at Celtic but not many believed it. The papers were claiming transfer budget expectations and concerns over his squad were the reasons but maybe he&#39;d simply achieved all he could, he&#39;d hit a glass ceiling. He was exhausted too.<br><br>He deserved respect and achieved much in the face of adversity. <br><br>A true Celtic great. His love for the club <span class="diffRemove">can</span><span class="diffAdd">c</span> never be questioned. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>  <h3>  Managerial Career Review (2010-14)<img align="right" alt="Lennon, Neil - Manager Pic" height="252" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/o_70k5KLzLUXPyQg7CxQdQ43095/GW392H252" title="Lennon, Neil - Manager Pic" width="392"></h3>  <div>  </div>So where can you begin? Everyone expected fireworks with <span class="diffAdd">Neil </span>Lennon&#39;s reign, and he did boldly claim that he wanted to bring back &#39;The Thunder&#39; to our club. However much could not be foreseen and it was a mostly great but tumultuous time.   <br><br>Coming on as a rookie, he was given a trial period before being confirmed as the de facto manager, and despite all the concerns he really stuck it out. As a testament to his character, you have to be in owe of what he has stood against in his long tenure, even against the sceptics in our own support let alone bigots in other supports and one-eyed ignorants in the media. <br><br>When you witnessed his nadir in the Kilmarnock doomsday 3-3 game in his first full season (when really he should have been given his jotters), you can hardly imagine that he&#39;d in time develop and rear the first side to great heights in Europe. He was a born fighter, and a developing coach. <br><br>Domestically the club were in the ascendency, admittedly the implosion of the Old Huns helped, but critics must remember that Lennon&#39;s Celtic overtook Rangers before they went over. How success with Celtic tipped the balance to send them overboard. Lennon had out fought Rangers and proudly could be tagged as the Celtic manager who brought down the Huns! Three league titles is not to be sniffed, and is a measure of the consistency he demanded. <br><br>It was in Europe that really made his name. The famous win over Barcelona was incredible and meant that Lennon was to leave an indelible mark on the first team, and possibly a highly difficult benchmark to emulate. He and his coaching staff engineered that win perfectly. Despite a rough patch of performances, he developed and learnt his skills. He learnt his lessons from his experience in matches and applied them, which showed progress from his first days at the club. That was admirable as it showed he was not arrogant to learn from others.<br><br>You must also note that the albatross round the club&#39;s neck was our poor European away record in the group stages. He&#39;d pushed the side to finally achieve an away victory in Moscow, something that his predecessors had repeatedly failed to do. It was a major achievement as it broke the psychological block that was hampering everything. <br><br>One major change, was that the football had become entertaining too, and the &#39;Thunder&#39; he promised to bring back was evident. After some often turgid football under his last two incumbents, this was a breath of fresh air. Despite the generally lower rated first XI squad players, he got the players to entertain as much as pushing to win. That is the Celtic Way. <br><br>Lennon had his faults, the worst of which was tactics. He&#39;d been na&iuml;ve to honestly admit to reporters that he didn&#39;t bother with tactics, and on many occasions it showed. Against Rangers, we were let down often by player who seemed to be left with little organisation. Domestically we lost too often in knock out matches in cups, it was poor. Motivation for the KO games was deemed to be lacking. If anything, it showed a lack of ability in tactics in KO games. We had it possibly too easy at home, and when pressure was put on the club then simply we slipped. Lennon has to take criticism for this. <br><br>In Europe also, there were a number of games where our gameplan was poor or non-existent. Against what was a poor Ajax side in 2013, Celtic capitulated 1-0 away when a draw could have been sufficient to take us through to the Europa League, but our tactics were so one-dimensional that the Dutch had it easy. Against Karagandy in the same season, Lennon got out of jail after poor tactics away almost cost us a place in the Champions League group stages (we recovered in the home leg). <br><br>Also in Europe, despite a fine haul of victories, we&#39;d come over too often as naive and win too many moral victories. We lost marginally too often, and you can only be on the wrong side just too often before you have to realise your errors. We needed better in terms of tactics, preparation and homework. Lennon seemed not too concerned, which was frustrating in the increasingly tough statistics-led football heavy environment. <br><br>Often, he was criticised for being over loyal to various players. Samaras is a perfect example. His star waned way too often, but Lennon stuck by him am on enough occasions he proved Lennon right. Still critics have enough counter evidence but Lennon has enough ammunition to keep them at bay. <br><br>He had a mixed record with youngsters and rearing players. No one can deny the general success, and dissent was rare. Wanyama, Forster, Hooper, Samaras, Forrest and Ledley owe huge to debts to the faith that Lennon placed in them. Granted there were many disappointments and failures too, however on the limited budget that Lennon had, he performed very well. Much here to admire. <br><br>Could be argued that he dallied on giving youngsters in the Celtic Boys Club a chance, and could have blooded them more especially when we had the league title sewn up. That&#39;s fair comment but many young players were given opportunities, although often too briefly. Yet when sent away on loans to other clubs, few shined, so Lennon likely made the right decisions in certain cases, but should have taken the gamble more with youngsters when given the chance.<br><br>The honest truth is that despite the overall good record, he&#39;d likely gone as far as he could. He hit a glass ceiling with Celtic. His last season in many ways showed his strengths and his weaknesses (i.e. losing crunch games but still getting the club well across the line), yet net he was very much in the black. His record is enviable and he was the architect for it. Some argues that his Celtic sides should have easily won the treble, but that&#39;s just nonsense. Celtic teams have to earn it, and few actually have in our history. It&#39;s not an easy target, and with so many fronts to target, there will be faults made.<br><br><div>  </div>However, if one issue was to outlive his successes then it was events off field. He&#39;d been attacked on the touchline by a rampaging Hun at Hearts, he&#39;d been given death threats online, he&#39;d been attacked outwith the club and he&#39;d been sent incendiary bomb devices. All because he was a Northern Irish Catholic playing for Celtic. The threats were unceasing but he soldiered on, and stood up to all his detractors.   <br><div>  <br>Admittedly, he could have just taken a step back at certain moments rather than react but that wasn&#39;t his character, and the shameful targeting of Lennon as well as the paper thin support given by the press was shameful. Lennon was often pictured with a scowl and unflattering pose in pictures tagged to articles, it was pathetic. Many in the press simply didn&#39;t like him, and used every opportunity to paint him as a villain. Often he was pictured as snarling and bitter or angry, when he was never such a character. It was pathetic. The bias against Lennon was unfathomable. One notable journalist on reflecting on the treatment on Lennon summarised the response perfectly: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>&quot;Political, cultural and civic Scotland has yet to explain its failure to protect Neil Lennon.&quot; <br>- Kevin McKenna (The Guardian, 2014) </i></blockquote></div>  <div>  </div>  <div>  <div>  </div></div><br>The supporters though were in love with him. Lennon never pandered to the support but he was whole hearted and heaped genuine praise when it was deserved but was also unafraid to strongly criticise the support when needed. However, Lennon complaining about the mock outrage and whinging about the output of the online forums, wasn&#39;t a bright idea. You all got to live with it. <br><br>He had become one of the rare few managers to leave the Celtic job on a high. Most others left Celtic on a low, after struggles, decline and league defeats. He was to hold his head up high as closed his books, and there was probably little better time. Most managers seem to have a similar shelf life at a club, so Lennon had done his stint, and likely was wary of overstaying his welcome. <br><br>Importantly, after a rocky start he&#39;d steered the good ship Celtic well and put us back on track so he was leaving Celtic in a far better state than he&#39;d found the job in. The club had gone through a few demoralising set of seasons prior to his full appointment, and he had helped turned the ship around to make us a proud club once more.<br><br>He will have the proud boast of having destroyed Rangers, and been the Celtic manager when they imploded and died. That is something to savour.<br><br>Lennon had done as he had said, he&#39;d brought the thunder back. For that and his courage in light of everything that occurred during his stint, we have the upmost respect for him. A true Celtic great as a manager and a man we should all be proud to be able to number as one of our own. <br><br><div>Whatever steps he next makes, it was not expected to be little as emotional, eventful or exciting as anything he ever experienced with Celtic in this reign. However, as things turned out, there were far more stories &amp; experiences to come.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Hibs &amp; Bolton managerial spells</h3><div>Neill Lennon had a mixed time at Bolton which was a basket case of a club heavily in debt with little support, and not even the greatest of managers could have pulled them through in the same circumstances that Neil Lennon unforgivably found himself in.</div><div><br>Managing Hibs turned out to be a major success for Lennon, helping them to promotion back to the top tier have a few seasons out, and helping them to stability in the top tier with some notable results.

He had only recently left Hibs under a cloud, but many sympathised with him. However, he was back at Celtic with the club 8pts in front of Sevco in the race for the league title and a Scottish Cup still to be won too, to complete a possible third treble in a row.<br><br>Celtic had the advantage with their nose in front, but that could be easily lost.<br><div></div><div><br>  Under Lennon, Celtic carried on from where they left off with Rodgers. His first match in charge was ironically against the two Edinburgh sides, but Celtic came through in both matches. Against Hearts it was a late injury time winner which rubbed it in for Hearts.<br><br>Celtic continued to win matches, albeit there was some concern as the margins were narrow, and it was worried that Lennon was favouring players, but whilst the first team was winning and stretching their league lead, there were few complaints.<br> <br> The thing is that in the league, Neil Lennon had to hardly lift a finger as Sevco were imploding. Having been level at the end of December in the league, Sevco had since then dropped many points and were to be 10pts behind in the run up to the third meeting of the season. The match was to be at Celtic Park, and as much as this was built as the title decider, for most the title race regardless of the result was already sealed. Celtic won the match v Sevco 2-1 at Celtic Park, which effectively sealed the title (if not yet fully), and there was relief and celebrations. Celtic mostly dominated although did let Sevco back into the match, and in some ways reflected the season as a whole, but there was no denying that Celtic were the better team overall in the match.<br><br>There was no denying it was hurting Sevco, with Ally McCoist on Celtic Park in a TalkRadio interview Show: <br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m on that new stretch of motorway that takes you the other side of Glasgow, I look the other way. If Celtic Park is on my left, I can&rsquo;t even look at it. I look to the right hand side!&rdquo;  </i><br></blockquote><br>The cherry on the cake was Sevco&#39;s defeat to Aberdeen in the Scottish Cup who had also knocked them out of the league cup as well, and was the first time they had defeated Sevco in all the major competitions in one season. For Celtic it was a filip that ended another of Sevco&#39;s chances of a first top tier trophy.<br> <br>It just all helped Lennon, his biggest fear was to see the advantage handed to him being lost and he would have to take all the flak undeservedly.<br><br>The result was a fine set of results over the course of his time as the interim manager, leading the First Team on to complete the domestic Treble-Treble - a truly historic achievement.<br><br>As for performances, it was a mixed bag, but there were a number of players who were not performing to the best of their ability due to mental exhaustion, injury or tiredness. The performances were in decline over his time, as the original impetus seemed to dip. The loss of key players over long stretches wasn&#39;t helping (e.g. Tierney, Christie, Griffiths, Boyata, Rogic etc) but maybe it was tactics &amp; formations too.<br><br>The fact is though that despite the positive results and hard work done by Lennon, some were convinced he was not the man for the long-run, and the defeat to Sevco at Ibrox was seen as the result that likely killed off Lennon&#39;s chances for the permanent role. It was a very poor performance and some criticised various team selections on the day.<br><br>However, the board had faith in him and offered him the job straight after the Scottish Cup final, which he accepted. Admittedly the response was mixed. Some fans felt he had passed the interim term test, others felt it was a backward move, and there was frustration that despite various names having been thrown about in the media, that no other major prospects were seriously approached &amp; interviewed for the role. <br><br><b>2019/2020</b><br>[...]</div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows
