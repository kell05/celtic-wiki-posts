Lennon, who would not confirm who would join his  coaching staff, said he was already searching for new talent.                                                          &quot;I need more men in the  team,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m looking for players with, experience and a better  mentality.&quot;<br><br><div class="bo">                           Lennon  said it was a &quot;wonderful moment&quot; to finally become manager of Celtic,  having acted as interim boss at the tail end of last season.                              &quot;To know that I would be in charge of the football club  was a very special moment for me personally,&quot; he said.                               &quot;And I&#39;m very proud to be walking in the footsteps of the  likes of Jock Stein, Davie Hay, Tommy Burns, Martin O&#39;Neill and others.                              &quot;But I&#39;m ready for the challenge. I don&#39;t  think anyone knows the club better than myself.</div>                                                                                                                                              <div class="bo">                                                       &quot;It&#39;s our priority  to challenge for the title, but I know I&#39;ve got to hit the ground  running.&quot;                                                         Johan  Mjallby, Alan Thompson and Garry Parker are expected to form Lennon&#39;s  backroom team.                                                          However, when pressed on the subject, Lennon said: &quot;There will be no  announcements until everything is in place.                                                          &quot;But there are no mixed messages. I will be  making all of the decisions on the football side of things.&quot;                               Stuart Baxter has been approached by the club to act  in an advisory capacity to Lennon while retaining his head coach  position with Finland.                             All Lennon would say  on Baxter was &quot;he&#39;s a candidate, among others&quot;.                                                          <br><br>However, reaffirmed that it  would be a wise idea to have a more experienced man on hand.                                                          &quot;I&#39;ve said before that I  might need an older head to bounce ideas off.                                                          &quot;It would be churlish to suggest I can do  all of this by myself.&quot;                                                          The former captain took charge of the team after Tony Mowbray&#39;s  sacking in March, enjoying a 100% league record.                               The only black mark against him was an embarrassing Scottish Cup  semi-final defeat at the hands of First Division Ross County.  And  despite more high-profile names such as the Republic of Ireland coach  Giovanni Trapattoni being linked with the position, Celtic chairman John  Reid insisted there was never anyone else in the frame.</div>                              <div class="bo">                                                       &quot;We have spoken to  no one, nor offered the job to anyone, other than Neil Lennon,&quot; said  Reid.                                                         &quot;We have  appointed Neil after the most careful thought, deliberation and  scrutiny.                                                         &quot;He  faced up to the challenge at the end of the season in difficult  circumstances, and he did his talking on the park.&quot;                               Signed by Martin O&#39;Neill, Lennon arrived at Celtic as a  hard-tackling midfielder in 2000, winning five championship titles in  seven seasons.                             He returned to the club in a  coaching capacity in 2008 to assist then manager Gordon Strachan.                               Following Strachan&#39;s exit and Mowbray&#39;s  subsequent employment last summer, Lennon was kept on but was sidelined  to a role with the under-19s.</div>      Story from BBC SPORT:<br><br> http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8728818.stm<br> <br> Published: 2010/06/09 10:34:31 GMT  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Lennon in war cry after Bhoys appointment</h3> <div class="Provided"> <div>09 June 2010</div>Provided by: The Irish  Examiner</div><div class="LeadPara">Neil  Lennon wants his Celtic players to &quot;go to war&quot; next  season to wrest  the Clydesdale Bank Premier League title back from Old Firm  rivals  Rangers.</div> <div class="LeadPara">The Irishman was confirmed  as the new manager of Celtic at a  press conference held at Parkhead  this morning after a spell as interim boss  following Tony Mowbray&rsquo;s  exit in March.</div> <div class="TailParas">The 38-year-old  former Celtic captain, who will be on a  one-year rolling contract,  wants his men fired up for the task ahead of  them.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;What  I want to do is bring is the thunder back,&quot; said  Lennon. &quot;I want this  place rocking again. I want the passion, I want the noise.  I want the  fans to be able to walk to the ground ready for it.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;I want the players to go to war every time they go on the  pitch. All those things will be in-built before the season starts.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;We&rsquo;ve got to put up a really stronger challenge to Rangers  and try to wrest the title away from them.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Lennon  refused to confirm who he will bring in as his  backroom staff but it  has been reported that his assistant Johan Mjallby will be  joined by  former Celtic midfielder Alan Thompson and Garry Parker.</div> <div class="TailParas">On  the issue of an experienced mentor, the former Leicester  midfielder  admitted that he will be looking for help but was quick to stress  that  Finland coach Stuart Baxter, reportedly put forward by the Celtic board,  is  only a candidate.</div> <div class="TailParas">Celtic  chairman John Reid intervened when Lennon was asked  if he had spoken to  Baxter but the new Hoops manager was keen to stress his  autonomy.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;Obviously  experience is the one thing I don&rsquo;t have...I  have other attributes,&quot;  added Lennon. &quot;It&rsquo;s an area that I might look to tap in  to, but again  that will be a announcement made when the decision is finalised by   myself.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;He (Baxter) is a candidate  amongst others. But as with all  the football decisions, whether they  be backroom staff, medical, or sport  science, I will have the final  say.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;But in that list of bringing  in someone with more  experience, he is a candidate. The backroom staff  that I have in mind probably  lack that experience too so I think I am  going in the unknown a wee bit but in  terms of what I know about the  club, I don&rsquo;t think anyone knows the club better  than myself.</div> <div class="TailParas">&quot;But it&rsquo;s just other aspects of the game that maybe I need  to work on.&quot;</div> <div class="TailParas">Lennon  admitted that Cardiff star Joe Ledley is on his  radar &ndash; &quot;he&rsquo;s one that  interests us, yes&quot; &ndash; but would go into no further details  about  possible targets, although player such as Sol Campbell, Jimmy Bullard  and  Liam Lawrence have been linked with moves to Glasgow.</div> <div class="TailParas">He  said: &quot;We have targeted players, we are looking to  strengthen in many  areas.

Police in Northern   Ireland have confirmed that they intercepted a package in Belfast   containing bullets, which was bound for Lennon and Niall McGinn,   Celtic&rsquo;s Northern Ireland international, in Glasgow.<br><br>Lennon, not for a first time, has sought to play down the incident.<br><br>No   Old Firm figure of recent times has so crystallised the debate about   Celtic, Rangers and life in the west of Scotland as Lennon. From the   moment the Northern Irish Catholic signed for Celtic, trouble has flared   around him, usually with a distinct sectarian whiff about it.<br><br>Lennon   has suffered death threats, twice been assaulted on a Glasgow street   and woke up one morning to find the words &ldquo;Neil Lennon: RIP&rdquo; daubed on   the road outside his home in the plush west end of Glasgow.<br><br>Frankly,   the fuss of the death threat that he received in August 2002 in  Belfast  before a match between Northern Ireland and Cyprus, which ended  his  international career, has sometimes paled compared to later  episodes in  his life as a Celtic player.<br><br>The very figure of  Lennon provokes  extreme love and hate on both sides of the  sectarian-tainted Old Firm  divide. He is adored by the Celtic faithful,  in part because, like  O&rsquo;Neill before him, he ticks all the boxes of  the traditional (and  sometimes mythical) Celtic narrative: he is Irish,  Catholic, and a  self-confessed socio-political underdog by upbringing.  Such traits are  enough to reduce some Celtic supporters to tears in  their admiration.<br><br>But  the Glasgow coin has another, darker side.  The more extreme elements of  the Rangers support detest Lennon and,  fuelled by the vitriolic  open-season that is the internet, they let him  have it from both barrels  almost on a daily basis.<br><br>On certain  Rangers fans&rsquo; message boards  there is a riot of bile and poison aimed  at Lennon that, were it ever  to appear in more public prints such as  newspapers, would lead to  shut-downs and swift defamation actions. What  Lennon has done in much of  this is to hold up a mirror showing a very  ugly image in the face of  west of Scotland society. He does not  actually lie awake at night  worrying about it all. Indeed, in his  street-wise, self-assured way, he  is not averse to seeing the funny or  ludicrous side to some of it.<br><br>One  of the most amusing stories he  told against himself was when he was the  victim of assault by two  students &mdash; one studying law, the other  studying medicine &mdash; in Glasgow  in 2003. Of his two assailants leaping on  him, and the punches between  the three starting to fly, Lennon  recalled: &ldquo;I remember lying on the  ground trying to fight off these  guys, with cars and buses happily  rolling by &mdash; nobody seemed to be  batting an eyelid at it.&rdquo;<br><br>Both  students were subsequently  convicted for assault, though Lennon was  keen to write a letter to  Glasgow University, which was said to be  threatening to discipline the  pair, asking for leniency.<br><br>In a  much more menacing episode in  2009, he was attacked outside a Glasgow  pub, and this time Lennon was  taken to hospital in quite a bad way. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mind admitting it &mdash; I got  quite a doing,&rdquo; he told me the next  day. On that occasion his assailant  was sent to prison.<br><br>One of  the more regrettable lines quite  often spouted by those who seek to  play down or minimise the sectarian  implications of these incidents is  that Lennon &ldquo;asks for it&rdquo; or is &ldquo;a  cocky sod&rdquo; or is &ldquo;a mouthy character  who gets what he deserves&rdquo;. These  are strange reactions to produce in  the face of such obvious and  startling evidence.<br><br>A young Graeme  Souness, when he was manager  of Rangers at a similar age to Lennon now,  was swaggering, self-assured  and had quite a bit of arrogance and  &ldquo;lip&rdquo; about him. But Souness was  not issued with death threats, or made  the subject of such public  hatred, or assaulted in the streets in this  manner.<br><br>It is true  that Lennon is no angel &mdash; he grew up in  Lurgan and has always had to  know how to look after himself. But the  fact is that Lennon embodies the  very thing that some residual bigots  in Scottish society and Scottish  football cannot stand: a visible,  vocal and successful Irish Catholic  who doesn&rsquo;t shirk from anything.  This is too much for some to bear.<br><br>At  an increasingly dark  Shielfield Park on Sunday night, where Lennon and  Celtic survived a  potential Scottish Cup banana skin by beating Berwick  Rangers 2-0, John  Reid, the Celtic chairman and former British home  secretary, was  waiting to put an arm around his club manager, given the  news that had  just filtered through about the package of bullets in the  post.<br><br>Reid  adores Lennon, and both men stand in the Celtic  tradition, but Reid  also knows what the Celtic manager sometimes has to  put up with.<br><br>For  good measure, as the Celtic bus pulled out of  Shielfield to head home  to Glasgow, a bottle was thrown that smashed  against its front  windscreen.  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Neil Lennon: The Bhoy who played with fire</h3><div>                                                               <div>  </div>                   </div><div class="viewarticlepanel">                                                      <div class="multiimageoff">                               <div><img alt="Lennon, Neil - Miscellaneous Articles (manager) - The Celtic Wiki" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/2/Ek7KhKvODMywIIxe8oXm_Q799" title="Lennon, Neil - Miscellaneous Articles (manager) - The Celtic Wiki"></div>                                                              <div>                                 <div>Published Date:                                  16 January 2011                               </div>                                                                </div></div>                                                                                                                                     </div>                                                                                                                <div class="byline">By Tom English</div>                                                                                                                                                                                      <div class="ds-firstpara"><br>IN THE   business of the bullet, the bomb and the belligerent man who draws the   heat to him like no other in Scottish football, Johan Mjallby has many   opinions.</div>                       There   was a certain amount of psychological profiling going on at Parkhead  in  the Celtic manager&#39;s absence on Friday. Maybe it wasn&#39;t the reason  why  Neil Lennon withdrew from his usual gig with the press - depending  on  what you believe about this fascinating character, he was either  away  helping old ladies across the road or biting the heads off small   children - but he is engrossed in a book at the moment, the second part   of Stieg Larsson&#39;s Millennium trilogy, The Girl Who Played With Fire.   Substitute girl for Bhoy and the title is apt, as Mjallby knows better   than most.<br><br>Yes, said the Swede of his old mate, Lennon could   certainly do with chilling out a bit for his own good. No, no, no, he   insisted, chilling out is the last thing Lennon is contemplating right   now. This is Lenny we&#39;re talking about. Lenny! <br><br>&quot;He is a bit like   a boxer, he is never going to give up,&quot; said Mjallby. &quot;But if he is   going to stay in this game as a manager, as I hope he will for a long   time, he will definitely mellow a wee bit. There are so many emotions   and thoughts going through your head for 24 hours a day but you probably   need to save your best bits for the dressing-room and the touchline.   He&#39;s shrewd enough to know that he can&#39;t use this negative energy all   the time.&quot;<br><br>It&#39;s been a turbulent season and the new year is   barely a fortnight old and already we have bullets and bricks and a ban   and maybe other bans to come if his boxer analogy is correct, which we   suspect it is. &quot;In the past, when I was a player,&quot; says Mjallby, &quot;Neil   was in the limelight and there was someone who supported another team   who would shout a few unprintable words. You get used to it. Even I had a   few words against me now and again but you just laugh about it.  There&#39;s  nothing to get upset about. Some things are worse, especially  when it  comes to death threats and bullets and all those annoying  things that  are so hard to stop in today&#39;s business. It&#39;s just a shame  we have to  speak about that.&quot;<br><br>Mjallby was still hurting after  the dropped  points from New Douglas Park, but there wasn&#39;t a whole lot  of moping  about a dodgy Accies goal or a penalty not given or a  debatable red card  for James Forrest. There was annoyance at the  performance and  acceptance that Celtic should have had enough to deal  with whatever  injustices came their way.<br><br>A mature reaction, you might say.<br><br>It&#39;s  strange, but in the early  months of the Lennon regime that is  precisely how he came across. The  dog days of Tony Mowbray&#39;s time were  pock-marked by griping about  referees. We are approaching the first  anniversary of Mowbray&#39;s euphemistic description of  the decisions  against Celtic being &quot;political&quot;, but Lennon, in the  beginning, never  had any truck with that. He seemed to acknowledge that  some of  Mowbray&#39;s players looked like they were using contentious  decisions  against them as a reason to lower their heads and throw up  their hands.  It was an attitude that clearly appalled Lennon. The irony,  of course,  is that Lennon has gone way further in his criticism of  officials than  Mowbray ever did. In fairness, his team has fight, but a  persecution  complex is a dangerous beast. It can work for you and it can  work  against you. It&#39;s unpredictable. Mjallby, it would appear, doesn&#39;t  want  anything to do with it. &quot;We&#39;re not going to use that (poor  refereeing]  as an excuse. We&#39;re not even going to use the goal that went  against  us on Wednesday as an excuse. We should have had enough  firepower to  win the game. It would be too easy for the players to use  that as an  excuse. That wasn&#39;t really why we didn&#39;t get the three  points. We  should have done better in the final third.&quot; How true.<br><br>This   Celtic war with officialdom is a curious thing. They look for   consistency in the decision-making of Scotland&#39;s referees and yet there   is ambiguity within Celtic itself about the relative crimes that have   been perpetrated against them by these supposedly biased whistlers.   Lennon, Reid and that rabbit in the headlights, Gary Hooper, are of the   mind that there is a plot afoot emanating from Hampden. Paddy McCourt   doesn&#39;t believe this. <br><br>Neither, we believe, does Thomas Rogne who   woke on Friday to find that, according to some tabloids, he had, in  the  company of a Norwegian journalist, branded Willie Collum a cheat  after  Wednesday&#39;s debacle at Hamilton. Lost in translation, it seems.  Fair  enough. <br><br>Mjallby doesn&#39;t buy the conspiracy line either,  which  surely makes for some interesting conversations with his pal  Lenny.  There are poor referees, but not dishonest ones, he says. That&#39;s  a  sizeable difference to what some around him at Parkhead are  thinking.  Then again, Mjallby never needed anybody&#39;s help to form an  opinion of  his own. When he sits down, still as large as a house in his  chair, and  says, &#39;Right, what do you need?&#39; there is no mistaking his  presence.  Lennon has his fury, but there are different ways to  illustrate how  uncompromising you are. Mjallby doesn&#39;t need to shout  and bawl. He wears  his intensity lightly, but you&#39;d want to be blind  not to see it all the  same.<br><br>&quot;You need to be unbelievably strong  mentally to deal with  all the things Neil has to deal with,&quot; he says,  putting Lennon on the  couch once more. &quot;That&#39;s why I think he has every  chance in the world to  become a very good manager.<br><br>It&#39;s quite  stressful, this job, and you need to be mentally strong.  Getting your  first job here is a bit tougher than starting in the  Championship. The  pressure is quite severe up here. You need to win  every game or you are  going to get crucified.<br><br>  &quot;He&#39;s used to that from his days as a  player. But this will stand him in  good stead the longer he stays in  the game. It&#39;s as tough as it gets,  especially when you talk about the  pressure. Maybe if you are manager  for one of the top teams in the  Premiership, but it&#39;s definitely much  harder working up here than  working for one of the teams down south  which is maybe only expected to  get a mid-table finish. We know all  about that and we enjoy the  pressure. I would rather work for a club  that is expected to win games  and titles than work for a team that is  only expected to win every  third game or collect four points every four  games.&quot;<br><br>For Mjallby  and Lennon, the show goes on. What tremors  lie ahead, God only knows.  He doesn&#39;t even know if there&#39;s a new  contract in the pipeline for the  pair of them but he doesn&#39;t seem all  that perturbed about it. &quot;We know  we only have this season anyway. It&#39;s  going to be the club&#39;s  prerogative to decide what they want to do. We  can only work as hard as  we can. It&#39;s not really difficult because we  have these players and we  know we want to improve the team. The only  thing that is hard is when  it comes to thinking of a long-term view but  you get used to that.&quot;<br><br>He has his focus and it&#39;s on the title. For him, it seems, all other issues are in the background.<br><br><ul class="viewarticle_info"><li>                           Last Updated:                             15 January 2011 9:20 PM                         </li><li>                                                         Source:                               Scotland On Sunday                                                     </li><li>                           Location:                            Scotland                         </li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3>                      <div class="headline"><h3>Andrew Smith: Scotland must ask itself why it seems to tolerate the campaign of hatred against Neil Lennon</h3></div><div>                                 Published Date:                                  13 March 2011                               </div>                               <div class="byline">By ANDREW SMITH<br><br>Source:                              Scotland On Sunday</div>                                                                                                                                                                                      <div class="ds-firstpara">BEYOND  the  issue of how long Neil Lennon can possibly put up with a daily   existence in which his freedom and safety, and those of his family, are   being challenged lie deeply uncomfortable questions. How have we   tolerated the fomenting of such hatred for so long to have brought us to   this point? And what does it say about our society?</div>                        The  bullets in the post in January that were followed  by a fake nail bomb  this month have taken the death threats and  intimidation against Lennon  to unprecedented levels for any public  figure in this country. <br><br>Safe-houses and 24-hour surveillance  have become necessities for the security of  the Celtic manager, his  partner and their five-year-old son. But such  grotesque developments  are in keeping with the disfiguring of ordinary  life Lennon has had to  contend with during his 11 years in Scotland. It  has escalated now  because his position has been elevated. It has always  been there,  though, and manifested itself in street assaults that have  brought  convictions for the culprits, sectarian slogans being daubed on  roads,  his retirement from playing for Northern Ireland after a  paramilitary  death threat received by the BBC and constant vile, viral  hate crimes.<br><br>The  internet, indeed, as pinpointed by both his  lawyer Paul McBride and  First Minister Alex Salmond this week, is now  recognised as the cesspit  in which too much verbal savagery has been  allowed to stew for too  long. Yet, what truly disturbs is not the  evidence of Facebook groups  such as Hunt Down Neil Lennon And Shoot Him,  Let&#39;s Hang Neil Lennon but  what masquerades as acceptable comment on  the 39-year-old in various  forums.<br><br>An &quot;ah, but&quot; element creeps in  to justify the treatment  of Lennon: &quot;Ah, but, even though no-one should  have to deal with death  threats, he brings it on himself&quot;. Expanded,  the haters would venture  that it is his snarling, his loss of control on  the touchline and,  having been reared in Lurgan, his embrace of what  Celtic stands for and  rejection of all things Rangers that make him an  accomplice in any  wrong-doing perpetrated against him or his family. <br><br>This  is  baloney that deliberately fuses and confuses two separate issues.   Anyone is entitled to have no time whatsoever for Lennon. This, though,   offers no legitimacy to those who believe that it extends to creating a   climate wherein, it is believed, some serious criminals in Northern   Ireland have felt sufficiently emboldened by a public mood in Scotland   to embark on a campaign of horrific harassment.<br><br>A campaign in   which Lennon  has been sent bullets and suspect packages, had distress   caused to his parents in his homeland and been forced to have a panic   button installed in his family home - a home which he and his partner   and child have had to be moved from three times in the past month as a   result of police receiving what they deemed &quot;credible&quot; threats.<br><br>Ultimately,  the targeting of Lennon doesn&#39;t come down to his  personality. His  bolshiness and bad-mouthing in the heat of battle are,  away from games,  underpinned - and so undercut - by an impressive  intelligence and  articulacy. It is a consequence, pure and simple, of his being an  unapologetic,  successful Northern Irish Catholic in a country where  there is a  virulent anti-Catholic strain among a section of the Rangers  support.<br><br>The  apparent unwillingness to confront this issue  head-on is one of the  reasons the pressures on Lennon have continued to  grow, and proved a  primary motivation in McBride and Lennon&#39;s agent  Martin Reilly putting  firmly into the public domain the intolerable  nature of what he is  living under in a supposedly-civilised society. <br><br>The  same week  Lennon received bullets, so to did fellow Northern Irish  Catholics Niall  McGinn and Paddy McCourt. Two more unassuming and  affable blokes you  could not meet. All three were then fresh from  Celtic&#39;s first league  success in a derby in two years. The hatred of  Lennon has been hiked up  in the ten weeks since, as Celtic have  attained a hitherto  long-surrendered supremacy in encounters with their  bitterest rivals. <br><br>Just  as fans of the Ibrox club, for the  first season in many years -  appearing to take their lead from the  Papal visit - have started giving  lusty renditions of their No Pope of  Rome ditty. It has barely been the  subject of media comment, far less  opprobrium, even if it patently comes  under the charge of &quot;incitement  to religious hatred&quot;. There is hardly  another football club in the  world that could find themselves in the  dock over that but still people  are unable or unwilling to join the dots  between the acceptance of  such illegality and hate crimes directed at  Lennon online, which must  now be tackled as would internet fraud,  terrorist threats and  paedophilia.<br><br>Lennon&#39;s ability, and  willingness, to stay in his  post, may come down to the seriousness with  which attempts are made to  take the heat out of a situation that is  impacting on both his personal  and professional life. He has not  appeared before the media since the  fake nail bomb addressed to him was  intercepted in Saltcoats ten days  ago. Assistant Johan Mjallby performed  such duties ahead of Celtic&#39;s  trip to Inverness today for their  sixth-round Scottish Cup tie, which  the host club have had to make  special security arrangements for in  order to accommodate the banned  Lennon in the stand of the Caledonian  Stadium.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s been in the limelight for reasons that are not to  do with football  and that&#39;s why he has decided to sit this one out,&quot;  the Swede said at  Lennoxtown on Friday. &quot;At the end of the day it&#39;s  about Celtic Football  Club and the players. That&#39;s what we want to discuss.&quot;<br><br>Mjallby,  who last  weekend rejected the suggestion floated by first-team coach  Alan  Thompson that Lennon could step away in the summer, insisted the  Celtic  manager&#39;s demeanour had not been affected by the invidious  circumstances  forced on him. &quot;He&#39;s going great,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s a  strong character.  You&#39;ve even more admiration for the way the guy works  so well with the  team, supports the players and thinks about tactics  (in the face of  what&#39;s happening off-field].&quot;<br><br>Those in Lennon&#39;s  circle and who  have encountered him professionally have rejected the  notion that he  will quit, East Fife manager John Robertson describing  him eloquently as  &quot;a warrior who would not walk&quot;. Yet despite offering  similar  sentiments, his agent also conceded that Glasgow was closing in  on his  client. &quot;If we go out on a Saturday night then we go to places  where  people won&#39;t give him any hassle - but we&#39;re running out of  places,&quot;  Reilly said. &quot;It seems to be wherever we go there&#39;s always  problems for  him.&quot;<br><br>For a man who, it must be remembered, has  been open about  his battles with depression, it has to be questioned  how sustainable it  is to live in a city where, in recent months,  walking down the street  with partner and child has at times become a  trial and a gauntlet for  the three; quite apart from all the other  desperate difficulties he has  been forced to endure. Yet Lennon is  doing a job he covets - perhaps  feels as if he was born for - and, as  the most decorated Celtic player  to belong entirely to the post-Jock  Stein era, has a keen sense of the  club&#39;s history and his potential  place within it.<br><br>There is only  so much it is worth going through  to make a managerial mark anywhere,  however beloved. That has long  been passed with Lennon. Now he needs the  will of government and  football authorities to reset the boundaries of  acceptable public  behaviour. He deserves that; we must demand it.<br><br><ul class="viewarticle_info"><li>                           Last Updated:                             12 March 2011 9:55 PM                         </li><li>                                                         Source:                               Scotland On Sunday                                                     </li><li>                           Location:                            Scotland<br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3><h3>Parcel bomb sent to Celtic manager </h3> (UKPA) &ndash; 20 Apr 2011<br><br>  Parcel bombs have been sent to Celtic manager Neil Lennon, a lawyer and  a politician, it was revealed on Tuesday.Strathclyde  Police have  launched an investigation after the parcels &quot;designed to  cause harm&quot;  were sent to Lennon, Paul McBride QC and Labour politician  Trish  Godman, sources said. They were initially thought to be hoax  packages  but analysis has revealed that they could have worked.<br><br>A police  source said: &quot;They were viable devices designed to cause harm. We are  treating the matter very seriously.&quot;A  package addressed to Lennon was  intercepted at the Royal Mail sorting  office in Kirkintilloch, East  Dunbartonshire, on March 26. On March 28 a  parcel for Trish Godman was  intercepted at her constituency office and  on April 15 a package was  intercepted en route to Paul McBride, who has  represented Lennon at  Hampden during his dispute with the SFA.Mr  McBride said he did not want  to comment. Ms Godman, who is stepping down  as West Renfrewshire MSP,  did not want to comment either as police have  advised her not to.  Police have offered safety advice to the intended  recipients of the  packages as well as to Royal Mail staff and workers in  the mail room at  Celtic.<br><br>It is the latest in a series of  incidents targeting  people linked with the football club. Earlier this  year packages  containing bullets were sent to Lennon and to Celtic  players Paddy  McCourt and Niall McGinn, all three of whom are from  Northern Ireland.  Scottish politicians have expressed their shock at the  developments.<br><br>SNP  leader and First Minister Alex Salmond said:  &quot;Let us be quite clear -  there is a major police investigation under way  to ensure that the  individual or individuals concerned are identified  and apprehended, and  then brought to book with the full force of the  law.&quot;We will not  tolerate this sort of criminality in Scotland,  and as an indication of  the seriousness with which we view these  developments the Cabinet  sub-committee met last Saturday to ensure that  the police investigation  has every possible support to come to a  successful conclusion. We are  confident that this will be the case.<br><br>&quot;These  disgraceful events  should remind all of us who love the game of  football of what unites us  as a community. It is time to remember what  we value in society, and  unite to condemn those who use football as a  pretext for their pathetic  and dangerous prejudices.<br>&quot;Scottish  Labour leader Iain Gray said:  &quot;I am shocked and appalled at this  sinister development. It is vital,  though, that people keep calm and do  not let the situation spiral out  of control as that would be playing  into the hands of the extremists  behind this vile act.    <br><br>Copyright &copy;  2011   The Press Association.

Mr Lennon&#39;s lawyer, Paul McBride QC, and former deputy   presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament, Trish Godman, were the   other two people targeted. <br><br><br>The devices were found at various  locations in the west of Scotland.         Sources close to the  investigation indicated they were  rudimentary and did not appear to  have been made by someone with  paramilitary training in bomb-making.                   Earlier this week, media organisations, including the  BBC, had  agreed to a police request not to broadcast details of the  bomb  incidents while officers carried out inquires. <br><br>Scotland&#39;s  First Minister Alex Salmond said: &quot;Let us be quite  clear - there is a  major police investigation under way to ensure that  the individual or  individuals concerned are identified and apprehended,  and then brought  to book with the full force of the law.         <br><br>&quot;We will not  tolerate this sort of criminality in Scotland,  and as an indication of  the seriousness with which we view these  developments the Cabinet  sub-committee met last Saturday to ensure that  the police investigation  has every possible support to come to a  successful conclusion.&quot;          The first suspect package was intercepted by the Royal Mail  in  Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, on 26 March and was addressed to  Mr  Lennon at Celtic&#39;s training ground in nearby Lennoxtown.<br><br><div class="audioInStoryC">          	             </div>          Two days later a device was delivered to Labour politician Ms   Godman&#39;s constituency office in Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire. Her staff   were suspicious of the package and contacted Strathclyde Police.          Detectives initially treated the two parcels as &quot;elaborate  hoaxes&quot;  designed to cause distress rather than serious injury but  further  analysis has led to them being reclassified as &quot;viable explosive   devices&quot;.         The third package was addressed to Mr McBride at the  Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh.          It is believed to have been  posted in Ayrshire before being  found in a letter box by a postal  worker on Friday and taken to a Royal  Mail sorting office in  Kilwinning, where police were contacted.   Explosive device 	       Detectives are also investigating another package addressed to  Neil  Lennon which was found at a sorting office in Saltcoats, North   Ayrshire, on 4 March but this has not been confirmed as an explosive   device.         It is understood that specialist anti-terrorist officers  are  involved in the investigation but a source close to the inquiry  said  they were &quot;not linking this to any terrorist organisation&quot;.          Henry McDonald, Ireland correspondent  for the Guardian newspaper,  said that made sense. <br><br>&quot;I think in terms of  the main loyalist  terror organisations that are now on ceasefire and say  they&#39;ve  decommissioned, I think they&#39;d be frankly embarrassed by this  kind of  thing,&quot; he said.         &quot;They would regard it as a thing of the past  and rather as an  irritant and an embarrassment to loyalism so I suspect  it&#39;s an  individual or individuals who maybe had bomb-making experience  in the  past who are disgruntled and looking for hate figures.&quot;          For the past decade Neil Lennon has been such a figure.         The  39-year-old Catholic from Lurgan, County Armagh, has endured threats,  abuse and violence.         He stopped playing international football  for Northern  Ireland in 2002 after a death threat, said to be from  loyalist  paramilitaries. <br><br>Lennon has also been the victim of a  street attack in Glasgow and several other death threats since joining  Celtic in 2000.         In January this year bullets addressed to the  Celtic manager  were intercepted at a sorting office in Glasgow. They  appeared to have  been sent from an address in Northern Ireland.   Media  coverage 	      The BBC has been told that the three individuals appear  to  have been targeted after they featured, on separate occasions, in  media  coverage.         Mr McBride is one of the highest-profile QCs in  Scotland and a well-known Celtic fan.         He has acted for the club  and Mr Lennon on several occasions during disputes with the Scottish  Football Association (SFA).         <br><br>The advocate has also been  highly critical of the SFA in its dealings with Mr Lennon and Celtic.           Ms Godman has a lower public profile than Mr Lennon or Mr McBride  but is well known in political circles as an avid Celtic fan.          Until dissolution of the Scottish Parliament last month, she  was deputy  presiding officer and the Labour MSP for West Renfrewshire.         On  her last day as an MSP she was pictured in the Holyrood chamber wearing a  Celtic football top.         Rangers and Celtic meet for the final time  this season at  Ibrox this weekend in a match which could prove crucial  in deciding the  Scottish Premier League title.<br><br>It is  understood that senior police officers are concerned about a potential  rise in tension ahead of the game on Easter Sunday.         The rivalry  between the two Glasgow clubs - known collectively as the Old Firm - is  historically tied up in religion.         Celtic were formed in 1888 by  Irish Catholic immigrants to raise funds to alleviate poverty in the  city&#39;s East End.         To this day, most Celtic fans come from a  Catholic background, while the majority of Rangers fans are Protestants.    Controversial match 	      Last month an ill-tempered Scottish Cup  clash between the two sides led to political intervention.         The  match saw three red cards, several touch-line and tunnel confrontations  and 34 arrests inside Celtic Park and 187 outside.         <br><br>After  the final whistle, Mr Lennon and Rangers assistant manager Ally McCoist  were involved in a confrontation.         Strathclyde Police requested a  Scottish government-led summit  after describing scenes at the game,  which Celtic won 1-0, as  &quot;shameful&quot;.         Both clubs subsequently  agreed to an action plan to tackle Old Firm-related disorder.          The fallout from the controversial match continued, however,  when the  Celtic manager subsequently received a ban for his actions.          McCoist had an initial two-match ban overturned, while two of  his  players, El-Hadji Diouf and Madjid Bougherra, were fined over their   actions after the sendings off.         This prompted highly-critical  comments from Mr McBride towards the SFA.         The advocate accused  the organisation of being &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, &quot;dishonest&quot; and &quot;biased&quot;.          In response the governing body described the QC&#39;s remarks as &quot;wild&quot;  and &quot;inaccurate&quot; and threatened to sue for defamation.         <br><br>The BBC understands there have since been moves by both sides to resolve the matter out of court.               	 	</div>      <div>  	 	     </div>           <div class="share-body-bottom"> 	    </div>    	     		     <div class="hyperpuff"> 	       	            		 	       	           	       	               	       	     </div> 	             	   	     </div>    	 	</div>  	 </div>       	 	           <div class="blq-rst blq-clearfix blq-foot-transparent blq-foot-text-dark">     <br>  BBC &copy; 2011</div> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3> <div><h3>  		 					 				 			Celtic&#39;s Neil Lennon hits back after criticism from Walter Smith</h3>21 May 2011 Guardian<br>&bull; Rangers&#39; Smith said Celtic referee criticism &#39;set ugly tone&#39;<br>&bull; Lennon: &#39;I think he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s totally wrong&#39;</div>Neil  Lennon has hit back at Walter Smith after the departing Rangers   manager claimed Celtic&#39;s criticism of referees &quot;set the tone&quot; for an   ugly Scottish season.<br><br>Smith pointed the finger directly at   Rangers&#39; city rivals this week but Lennon, the Celtic manager, firmly   disputed those comments on the eve of his team&#39;s Scottish Cup final   against Motherwell.<br><br>&quot;I was disappointed by it,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;He   could have spoken to me about it first. He had plenty of opportunities   to do that. I didn&#39;t think there was any real need for it either. I   think he&#39;s wrong, he&#39;s totally wrong.&quot;<br><br>Lennon made direct   reference to Celtic&#39;s infamous visit to Dundee United in October. On   that occasion the referee, Dougie McDonald, lied to the Celtic manager   over the circumstances surrounding the reversal of a penalty award.<br><br>&quot;Listen,   I went into a referee&#39;s room and the guy didn&#39;t tell me the truth,&quot;   Lennon said. &quot;Then his assistant came out two days later and blew the   whistle on him. I didn&#39;t, our club didn&#39;t. They did.<br><br>&quot;Then there   were cover-ups and non-truths. It led me to think: &#39;Well, I&#39;m not the   first Celtic manager not to be told the truth.&#39;<br><br>&quot;Our club were   just looking for transparency. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a lot to ask for. I   mean, you are being lied to. It&#39;s not even a major lie but it just grew   and grew and grew into something they created themselves.&quot;<br><br>On   another matter of officialdom Lennon said: &quot;I went to a disciplinary   hearing for the first time and got a six-game ban. The president [of the   Scottish FA] was there and was in and out of the meeting. Is that  right  or wrong? Should he be there?<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s got a right to be  there but  was he at other disciplinary meetings this year? So then we  had to bring  in legal advice to say it was fundamentally wrong, what  they did in the  disciplinary meeting.&quot;<br><br>Lennon would be forgiven a  sigh of relief  when the final whistle blows on the Scottish season at  Hampden Park on  Saturday. The Northern Irishman knows victory over  Motherwell would hand  Celtic their first trophy since 2009; football  issues have been firmly  overshadowed in recent months, though, by  security threats towards  Lennon.<br><br>Nonetheless, in the latest  display of his character,  Lennon said the close season does not sit  well with him. He even saw fit  to joke about his personal circumstances  on Friday.<br><br>&quot;It was  funny yesterday, I played golf and it was a  shotgun start,&quot; Lennon said  with a laugh. &quot;I effing shampoo myself.  Four heavies came out of the  trees and jumped on me.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t want this season to end. I&#39;ve loved it and I&#39;ve more or less enjoyed every minute of it, in the football sense.&quot;<br><br>Lennon   reiterated that he had not considered leaving Celtic as security  issues  surrounding him become more intense. &quot;I owe it to the players I  brought  to the club to try to establish both me and them at the club,&quot;  he  added.<br><br>&quot;To then have walked away and left them, when they had   contributed so much to the club this season, would have been remiss of   me.<br><br>&quot;People wouldn&#39;t have said, &#39;That was a selfish thing to  do&#39;,  and it had crossed my mind once or twice. But in the wider scheme  of  things, I love this job. When you love football as much as we do,  then  to be a manager is a privilege. So you shouldn&#39;t have to give up  your  job for non-footballing reasons.&quot;<br><br><a class="external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/may/20/celtic-neil-lennon-walter-smith?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/may/20/celtic-neil-lennon-walter-smith?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter</a><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3><h3>   Some sense:</h3><a class="external" href="http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/7254/38/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/7254/38/</a><br><br> 15 May ~ <br>  For the second time in a month, Scottish football is making headlines  around the world. Unfortunately, the first time was because &ldquo;viable&rdquo;  explosive devices were posted to Celtic manager Neil Lennon and  high-profile Celtic fans. The second occurred when Lennon was assaulted  by a Hearts fan on the Tynecastle pitch on Wednesday night, as if in a  deliberate attempt to prove that this level of football hatred is not  unique to the west coast, and that, in terms of football, Scotland is  not a civilised country.<br> <br> In WSC 291 I documented the abuse  Lennon has endured so far in Scotland (assaults, death threats, bullets  in the post, hoax bombs). With the benefit of hindsight, maybe I should  have waited a month. Also this week, Lennon has received another bullet  in the post and seven people have been arrested on firearms offences  outside Celtic&rsquo;s training ground.<br> <br> Has any other football figure  in the world ever had to put up with such a sustained, serious and  dangerous level of threats? From London to San Jose, the press are  unanimous in what they see as unacceptable abuse of a football manager  trying to do his job. Meanwhile, in the Scottish media, far too many  articles on the threats to Lennon this season have featured attacks on  Lennon&rsquo;s behavior and insinuations that he&rsquo;s bringing it on himself.<br> <br>  It&rsquo;s true that Martin O&rsquo;Neill &ndash; also an Irish Catholic &ndash; never received  similar abuse while managing Celtic. But of what exactly does Lennon  stand accused? He argued and swore at the officials at Tynecastle  earlier this season. He&rsquo;s complained about specific refereeing decisions  that have gone against Celtic. He argued back to Ally McCoist when  McCoist whispered something in his ear. He&rsquo;s kicked some water bottles.  And he cupped his ears at Rangers fans who were chanting &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it like  to live in fear?&rdquo; at him.<br> <br> In short, he&rsquo;s acted like many other  football managers. And every one of these events has been blown up in  the Scottish press, with the juiciest images and the most extensive  possible coverage. A picture of him arguing with McCoist was by far the  most common one used to illustrate a game in which three Rangers players  were sent off &ndash; defender Madjid Bougherra grappled with the referee,  striker El Hadji Diouf barged into the Celtic physio and McCoist had to  be prevented from invading the Celtic dugout. It&rsquo;s hard to escape the  conclusion that large sections of the Scottish press have an agenda  against Lennon. And harder still to escape the conclusion that too many  idiots see this as legitimisation of their own hatred.<br> <br> There  are plenty of high-profile managers outside Scotland who are more  controversial than the Celtic boss. Would Alex Ferguson or Jose Mourinho  receive the same abuse in Scotland? I suspect not. What if they were  Irish and Catholic, and managed Celtic? I don&rsquo;t know. The only people  who do know are those responsible for the death threats, assaults,  bullets and bombs. <br> <br> Mark Poole   <br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3> <h3>   </h3> <b>By Rossi of the KDS forum</b><br>see link: http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/single/?p=10418147&amp;t=8499779<br><br>  I&#39;m sick of this &quot;brings it on himself&quot; nonsense. I really do find it quite upsetting and almost disturbing that throughout everything this same excuse has been used over and over. It seems to have spread throughout the media all over Britain to the point that Eamon Holmes made a reference to it on Sunrise this morning.<br><br>What actions constitute for reactions involving bombs, bullets and attacks? I can&#39;t quite understand why this is deemed an acceptable excuse for what has occurred over the last few months. I want to know what it is that Neil Lennon has done that has meant he deserves and is at fault for this. I have been provided with a list of incidences and reasons that are supposed to prove that Lennon is to blame for what he has gone through this season.<br><br>I think we all know that no matter what these reasons are they do not legislate for what our manager has gone through over the last twelve months. However, many areas of Scotland and many media outlets seem to believe they do so I am now going to go through them all for the pleasure of your reading and to finally put to bed this ridiculous notion that Lennon is at fault for what has happened. I know some of you may question why I would waste my time doing this but I feel really strongly about the lunacy behind this excuse and the way it has become the gospel truth when commentating and writing about has happened.<br><br>1.)A referee changes his mind on a decision. Neil Lennon demands clarification after the game on this event, setting into motion a series of events that ends with the linesman resigning, the referee resigning and the sacking of the referees chief.<br><br>- Neil Lennon did not demand clarity in any way, shape or form. His post-match comments were as follows:<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s given the penalty and for me he can&#39;t change his mind. I didn&#39;t get an explanation until the referee came over and spoke to me; his explanation was that his linesman had a better view of it and the keeper had played the ball. He looked adamant to me when he gave the penalty. He got a good look at it. There was a long, long delay between him awarding the penalty and him allowing the bounce ball&quot;<br><br>As you can see, there was no enraged request for clarity on the matter. He has commented on the situation that developed after the reporter asked the question. This is normal in the post-match interviews of a match that involved a controversial decision. An example, Kenny Dalglish in the aftermath of Liverpool&#39;s FA Cup loss to Manchester United. He commented by saying:&quot;The penalty was a joke. Unless they have changed the rules it is not a penalty.&quot; You could argue that Kenny&#39;s comment are more critical of Webb than Lennon&#39;s were of McDonald; no threats for Kenny, mind. It is also interesting to point out the comments of Peter Houston after this game. He said:<br><br>&quot;Dougie couldn&#39;t get his finger to the spot quickly enough. It&#39;s not the first he has given against us. Celtic created chances but I thought we coped well with anything they threw at us but then Dougie McDonald conspires to try to give a penalty against us. Then it transpires that it is not a penalty. What has happened there? I don&#39;t know what goes through Dougie McDonald&#39;s mind, permanently!&quot;<br><br>Those comments are far, far more scathing than anything Lennon has said and they weren&#39;t the first time Houston had questioned referee Dougie McDonald. Prior to this he said, after a 3-3 draw at Ibrox: &quot;I am disappointed and I just wonder if the penalties would have been given at the other end.&quot; Oddly Houston never received any direct criticism for his remarks from the media. Following the match, Celtic wrote to the SFA regarding what had happened. Stewart Regan then confirmed that Dougie McDonald had lied to Neil Lennon and Celtic; John Reid then requested the SFA punish McDonald for his actions. Six weeks on he resigned. This was nothing to do with Neil Lennon. Steven Craven, the linesman, cited &quot;harassment and bullying&quot; from SFA superiors as the reason behind his resignation. Again, nothing to do with Neil Lennon. Dallas came under fire because of decisions he made which were no way because of Celtic Football Club. He chose to try and protect McDonald and he chose to involve himself in sectarian emails. It was the Catholic Church who requested Dallas be sacked, not Lennon and not Celtic so how the blame can be put at Lennon&#39;s feet is beyond me.<br><br>2.) A referee does a high profile game, and gives a major decision that is not to the wishes of the home side. Neil Lennon after the game calls his judgement into question, lies that the referee could not have seen the incident, and brings a few more less obvious ones up all to question the impartiality of said official. This referee later receives various threats from supporters of the team, which Neil Lennon claims are &quot;nothing to do with football&quot;.<br><br>Correctly, Neil Lennon commented on two decisions made by Willie Collum that day. On the penalty and McCulloch, he said:<br><br>&quot;I feel let down on the penalty incident for sure. It&#39;s a big decision. I have seen a replay of the penalty and it looked soft.vI&#39;m not sure he saw it and I&#39;m not sure why he has given it. I have problems with my team but you have to get the big decisions right. I&#39;ll be asking for an explanation. I want to know why McCulloch was still on the pitch, it was blatant obstruction when we were breaking. It was a second yellow and they should have been down to 10 men in the second half.&quot;<br><br>A few days later, Lennon commented by saying: &quot;I never got the opportunity to speak to the referee on Sunday. I am still not convinced he saw the incident properly. I don&#39;t know how he can be 100 per cent sure it can be a penalty. If he saw it again, I don&#39;t think he would say it was a penalty.&quot; As you can see from this vdieo:<br><br><br><br>Lennon didn&#39;t lie. Collum never seen it and the entire Sky studio agree&#39;s with that point. Due to this Celtic once again wrote to the SFA and Neil Lennon made no further comment. Collum received three phone calls on the night of the match as confirmed by himself and when asked about this Lennon responded:<br><br>&quot;It is desperate. I don&rsquo;t want this to overspill to something against Willie&rsquo;s well-being. People must remember its just a game.&quot;<br><br>As you can see - full condemnation for the morons who called Collum. Once again, I&#39;m struggling to see how blame can be attached to Lennon. He never made the call and he is well within his rights to question poor decisions. Something managers do all over the world without it cropping up as an excuse to try and blow them up.<br><br>3.) A referee makes a decision to send off a player. One man goes apoplectic on touchline, questions parentage of referee, and also uses a few other choice phrases before beign sent to stand. In a radio interview afterwards he claims ref and officials will &quot;collude to get their stories straight&quot; a clear hint he believes they will lie over incident.<br><br>The one and only occasion that Lennon has been sent to the stands in the SPL this season. An unsavory incident in which Lennon himself as publicly admitted he let himself down. However, I don&#39;t remember Smith being deserved of death threats and attacks because of any of these incidences:<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>We should get on that because after all, he would of &quot;brought it on himself&quot;. Remember, folks - Lennon should be more like Walter. :rolleyes:<br><br>After the events of the Dundee Utd match in which two officials made up a story, told the Head of Referee&#39;s in Scotland and he then told them to continue I&#39;m sure Lennon has every right to state that they will no doubt collude and lie. And the tone of that interview makes it quite obvious that Lennon was talking with humour. And once again, he isn&#39;t the first manager to react badly when sent to the stands. Arsene Wenger chose to do this:<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>when he was sent to the stands at Old Trafford. Imagine my surprise at the lack of threats made to him over the incident.<br><br>4.) All of above points push referees to breaking point and they finally decide to strike. Neil Lennon is noticeable in is absence of comment about this, and also appears immune from any media criticism.<br><br>Doubt his absence was that noticeable because he did comment on it:<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m optimistic that something good will come out of it. First of all I&#39;m pretty pleased the games going ahead, not only for the players but the supporters as well and we&#39;ll see what the outcome or the aftermath is after this weekend. At the minute we&rsquo;re in the dark as to who the official is going to be. We wont be making any comment or any sort of criticism on who it might be. We&#39;re just pleased that these guys have made an effort to come over and keep the programme alive. It&#39;s not for me to comment on why there is a strike or what the reasons for the strike are. People have their own reasons for that. I understand it to a certain extent. I don&#39;t know what the outcome&#39;s going to be, I hope it will have a positive reaction rather than a negative one.&rdquo;<br><br>A statement from Dougie McDonald:<br><br>&quot;My Category 1 colleagues decided rightly to withdraw their services from matches this weekend in response to the outrageous way they have been treated by sections within Scottish football and, in my opinion, the lack of support they have received from the SFA General Purposes Committee in recent years. &quot;It is also important to make clear that just as this issue is not about Dougie McDonald alone, nor is it about Celtic Football Club alone. I have read comments this week from Craig Brown, whom I admire hugely in the way he deals with referees, saying his club doesn&#39;t engage in questioning referees publicly. They maybe haven&#39;t under his reign, but the previous manager did and I don&#39;t recall the club apologising or dealing with their employee. The truth is, since I became a class one referee, managers or players - and sometimes directors - at almost every club, at one time or another, have been guilty of such behaviour&quot;<br><br>I think this quite clearly shows they were not at breaking point because of the above events and Neil Lennon did not cause a referee&#39;s strike. Again, how this means he deserves to attacked and threatened I do not know.<br><br>5.) After a league game Neil Lennon again appears to question honesty and integrity of referee as his team only got one soft penalty, but were denied a late goal by a correct decision.<br><br>Firstly, Celtic&#39;s penalty wasn&#39;t soft. It was clear cut. Lennon&#39;s comments post match:<br><br>&quot;You&#39;re talking about big moments in the game again - Hamilton&#39;s goal, which shouldn&#39;t have been a goal, and penalty we should&#39;ve had. It seems to be every other game now. I don&#39;t want to say too much as I&#39;m in enough trouble, but it&#39;s frustrating.&quot;<br><br>Yes, I can see this is steeped in accusation over honesty and integrity... Or not. It&#39;s a manager making comment about a poor decision. Something many managers can do without fear of a bullet being sent to them in the aftermath. Terry Butcher as an example.<br><br>After a 2-1 loss to Celtic:<br><br>&quot;No action was taken against the Celtic player (at the penalty] who denied my player a chance of a goal. Four officials did not see who committed the foal and if it had happened at the other end I&#39;m sure we would have had one of our players sent off. The free-kick for the second goal was in front of the Celtic fans. Had it happened at the other end it wouldn&#39;t have been given. The Celtic fans were jumping up and down screaming and shouting, as they do, the referee gives it and books my player as well. I just think the referee&#39;s got to be a bit stronger. There were a lot of fouls given against us tonight through minimal contact.&quot;<br><br>After a 1-0 loss to Rangers:<br><br>&quot;Adam Rooney was fouled clear as day right on the touchline, right in front of us, right in front of the linesman, fourth official and the referee. No-one else around him that could block his view but he doesn&rsquo;t give the foul and Rangers break away and score. I know that we have to defend from that situation but there&rsquo;s a sense of injustice from the players point of view because the referee has stopped any sort of contact on Weiss, every time one of our players went within his magnetic field a foul was given against us. We couldn&rsquo;t believe it that Adam wasn&rsquo;t given a foul, it was a clear foul, he didn&rsquo;t give it, Rangers scored and the injustice was there.&quot;<br><br>Or what about Water &#39;I don&#39;t question referee&#39;s&#39; Smith?<br><br>On Killie&#39;s penalty award at Ibrox:<br><br>&quot;Kilmarnock managed to get themselves a penalty. It got them back in the game. If that was penalty and Nikica Jelavic&#39;s [claim] at the other end of the pitch wasn&#39;t a penalty then I don&#39;t know where the referee was. It was a very strange decision&quot;<br><br>On the Cup replay red cards:<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t think these warranted orderings off. I didn&#39;t think the referee handled that aspect of it very well. For Whittaker&#39;s first foul he was fouled prior to that and I felt the referee missed that and was quick to book him. I didn&#39;t think it was a necessary one. Madjid Bougherra&#39;s second booking was a complete overreaction by the referee.&quot;<br><br>On Jelavic&#39;s yellow card for simulation; LC final:<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s dangerous for a referee to do that. If it had happened in the other box... I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve said before Celtic mounted a campaign at the start of the season but if you are good enough you&#39;ll win despite a refereeing decision. Today we&#39;ve won and I am delighted. I felt aggrieved Jelavic was booked because the referee&#39;s first reaction was he&#39;d been fouled. The referee gave the penalty and then didn&#39;t. But he must have thought there was something in it to give it in the first place. I don&#39;t know why he changed his mind but that&#39;s what he told the players.&quot;<br><br>On the penalty awarded to Stokes:<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not a penalty kick. But then again, they got it and Allan McGregor saved it. Celtic will be happy now because their whole campaign this season has been one of asking for decisions. Well, they got one today and Allan saved it so that&#39;s it. Over the season all we&#39;ve heard is that Celtic don&rsquo;t get penalty kicks &ndash; they got one today. They tried to get another one as well &ndash; both of them were exactly the same. On both occasions the players ran into [our] players and I don&rsquo;t think they were penalties. I think the referee got the second one wrong.&quot;<br><br>On Willie Collums decision to red card Kenny Miller:<br><br>&quot;We are extremely disappointed by the referee&#39;s decision. It&#39;s t&#39;s especially hard to understand how he can uphold the red card given that, during the game, he was telling our players Kenny Miller had kicked Dods in the head. That was the reason he gave for producing a red card. But, having watched the TV evidence myself, that is clearly not the case. The referee is adamant this was violent conduct but from watching the tapes I have to say there is not even a great deal of anger being shown by either of the players. You would expect to see anger involved in acase of violent conduct. That&#39;s why I&#39;m disappointed in his decision not to change his mind. It seems obvious he got it wrong.&quot;<br><br>On a disallowed goal for Boyd:<br><br>&quot;It was a poor decision by the linesman. I think the TV replays show quite clearly that Kris Boyd was onside. Mr Murphy was quick to allow a Scott McDonald goal at Celtic Park last season. And he was quick to disallow that one tonight.&quot;<br><br>He questions the integrity of referee&#39;s on more than one occasion there. Not only have the SPL never reprimanded him for it but again, he has never had his life threatened because of it. Must be because he isn&#39;t an &quot;uppity Fenian&quot; like Lennon.<br><br>6.) Neil Lennon gets a 6 game suspension for his numerous fights and outbursts but gets a lawyer to argue his case and get it reduced to 4, with 2 suspended should he step out of line again.<br><br>And this is reason to bomb him? Numerous fights :loel: he has been sent to the stand once in the SPL and incident which he subsequently apologised for. The excessive verdict was correctly appealed as it was an unprecedented ban for a first offence. If this is a reason to bomb in then I am lost for words. Should McCoist be bombed for appealing his two game ban? Should Smith be bombed for several touchline ban&#39;s he has served? In fact, has any manager in football had bomb threats over appealing a ban?<br><br>7.) After a stormy cup tie Neil Lennon insults at least 3 players of opposing team, questioning their integrity and honesty.<br><br>Look, a fabricated lie created on a certain internet forum which has since become some sort of fact. I&#39;d love to see some actual evidence of this. Something more than the illusions of Rangers supporters who think their club cover have some sort of dossier on Lennon and things he has done but for whatever reason they don&#39;t want to report it. Lies. Lies. Lies. Weiss on this alleged incident: &quot;If I had heard him saying anything to me I would probably have said something back. But I didn&#39;t hear anything.&quot;<br><br>8.) In replay Neil Lennon had a stand up fight with player of opposition team (possibly racially abusing him at same time), argued with referee when told to sit down and calm down, argued and snarled entire game, and got involved in an altercation with opposite number at end of game.<br><br>Wow, another follow follow fabrication - the racial abuse of Diouf. :loel: Something which El Hadji Diouf himself admitted was nonsense when he confirmed: &quot;He is not a racist. He did not racially abuse me.&quot; Repeat a delusion enough times and suddenly it becomes fact. There was no stand up fight. Diouf made movements towards our bench, he attempted to encroach and enter our bench. It is clear who the aggressor is:<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>And Lennon never argued with the referee at all. More fabrication. He retreated into our bench quite quickly as Diouf continued to try and access our bench, having to be held back by Rangers players and referee&#39;s whilst Lennon stood in our bench next to John Clark. Ally McCoist also had to be restrained by Smith after the incident began. I find Diouf interesting here because this accusation of &quot;bringing it on yourself&quot; does it apply to everyone? Because I&#39;m at a bit of a loss as to why a man who has been involved in so many foul incidents in football has not had a nail bomb sent to him yet? He takes &quot;bringing it on yourself&quot; to an entire new level.<br><br>Argued and snarled the entire game. Again, I&#39;d love to see some evidence of this. I&#39;d love to see evidence of a member of the Rangers staff having to physically hold Neil Lennon back as he approached their bench:<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>And yes, an altercation that was started by whom exactly? Neil Lennon approached McCoist with a smile on his face, ready to put the match behind them and shake his hand. Lennon didn&#39;t cause that. If McCoist had kept his fat mouth closed the incident would never have happened. Interesting too that McCoist himself has never been threatened after the events of this game.<br><br>9.) Neil Lennon got a 2 game ban for this, and his suspended ban was added on. He declined to appeal this, in the knowledge his lawyer felt he&#39;d only end up serving 1 game of 4, so although it may be legal, it certainly is morally wrong.<br><br>So now a lawyer correctly applying SFA guidelines is reason for Lennon to be threatened? This is a part of the &quot;bringing on himself&quot;. I don&#39;t whether to laugh or cry at how desperate this is. And as for morally wrong, he served the ban. McCoist, Diouf and Bougherra however were let off scott free. That was, morally spot on... Sure.<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>10.)Neil Lennon felt the need to comment on an ongoing UEFA investigation into supporters of another team in a match his team were not even involved in.<br><br>Oh wow, more lies. The only comment regarding this which involved Rangers that Lennon made was when he claimed Rangers and Celtic &quot;do as much as they can to stamp it out&quot;. He then said:<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s been going on for quite a while. I&#39;ve been here for 10 years, when I played there was quite a lot of it. Martin O&#39;Neill made a stance against it in 2005 and got shot down by a lot of people in the media. In 2011 it&#39;s still ongoing. It&#39;s taken maybe an intervention from UEFA for people to come out and condemn it from all quarters. That might be a good thing in the long run.&quot;<br><br>11.) Neil Lennon feels the need to provoke opposition fans through celebrations, entering the field of play at full time and gestures.<br><br>Where are these provocative celebrations. Last night Lennon was attacked after Hooper scored. Here you can see his celebration:<br><br><br><br>Just how easily provoked are Hearts supporters? Directly in front of our bench, lifts his arms aloft and that is it. Was Mourinho attacked for this?<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Or on this occasion:<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Would he have been to blame if he was? How about Pep...<br><br><br><br>Or what about McCoist? Who left the technical area to join Lafferty who had just ran directly next to the Celtic fans.<br><br>Posted Image<br><br>Lennon also has the right to enter the field at full time. This isn&#39;t reserved for Ibrox. He does it at every away ground in Scotland, much the same as Artur Boruc blessing himself was something reserved for Ibrox. He wants to do; he can. This is something which many managers do at full time without fear. As for his gesture - deserved. If you can&#39;t take it then don&#39;t dish it out.<br><br>Craig Brown on the gesture:<br><br>&quot;All that I&rsquo;ll say is that [BBC Scotland&#39;s trackside reporter] Chick Young told me that Neil had been subjected to horrendous abuse throughout the game and that was his way of responding&quot;<br><br>Alan Thompson:<br><br>&quot;I was two feet in front of Neil and was surprised nothing was done, especially with such a large police presence in that vicinity. I heard some horrendous things going up the tunnel at the end. It&rsquo;s staggering people can shout some of the things they did. The fans seem to be able to say what they want and get away with it&quot;<br><br>And all Lennon did was cup his ears.<br><br>12.) Only Neil Lennon has received these alleged bullets and nail bombs and now you know why.<br><br>So why were Niall McGinn and Paddy McCourt sent bullets. Why were Paul McBride, Trish Godman and The Cardinal sent bombs. Did they bring it on themselves too? Or did Neil Lennon bring it on for them.<br><br>So there it is. The supposed reasons for why this has happened and why Neil is to blame for it. A myth that has spread like wild and has now become sort of accepted reasoning for this madness. He did this, he did that, but but but. That is all we will ever hear on this subject. As shown by the reasons put forward, these people have opinions which are etched in their heads despite all reasoning and common sense. It is a very sad state of affairs. I presume the Jews brought it on themselves too by becoming successful and getting good jobs, good houses etc.<br><br>Also, can I have the award for Longest KDS post in history?  <br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3> <h3>   </h3><h3> Is the Scottish Media stirring up the hatred towards Neil Lennon?</h3>July 2011, ESPN<br>Posted by Andy Muirhead<br><br>Over  the past eleven years Neil Lennon&#39;s life has revolved in and around  Celtic Football Club. And in all those years the Northern Irishman has  received a level of hatred and abuse that no man in British Football has  endured. From Parcel Bombs to bullets to being assaulted on the streets  of Glasgow and the sideline at Tynecastle, Lennon has had to endure so  much in those 11 years that it would make lesser men run for the hills. A  campaign of attrition so hate-filled that it would have had a lesser  man throw in the towel long ago.<br><br>So why has it gotten so bad? In my opinion, elements within the Scottish mainstream media.<br><br>From  phone-ins to the written press to TV broadcasts, Neil Lennon has been  subjected to the level of spin that Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell  would be proud of.<br><br>Throughout his Celtic career, Lennon was targeted  as an overly aggressive player, at times labelled a snarling dog. Yet in  all his time at Celtic Park how many bookings did he receive? Not as  many as some would lead you to believe. Yes he was confrontational and  was passionate on the field, but what great central midfielder isn&#39;t?  Roy Keane is a prime example of a dominant central midfielder who is  passionate, who is confrontational and who likes to get a bit lippy and  stuck in. So where were his bombs, bullets, assaults?<br><br>During the  Summer, Celtic travelled Down Under on a Pre-season tour of Australia.  But the tour was overshadowed - in the Scottish press that is - of his  comments on a stunt by some Rangers fans in Perth.<br><br>The Perth Rangers  Supporters Club tried to goad Celtic by organising a plane to fly over  the stadium just before kick off trailing a banner that boasted about  Rangers&#39; three SPL titles in a row.<br><br>Lennon was asked after the match  about the stunt and he told reporters: &quot;Well, you&#39;d think they&#39;d have  better things to do following their team in Germany (for their  pre-season tour) than pay a lot of money to annoy us, I think they&#39;re a  wee bit obsessed with us at the minute.&quot;<br><br>Nothing twisted or  hate-filled in those comments, in fact the video footage of the post  match interview saw Lennon quite calm and collected when answering.<br>Cue the headlines from the Scottish newspapers:<br><br>&quot;Neil Lennon raps plane crazy Rangers fans&quot;<br><br>&quot;Lenny&rsquo;s air rage&quot;<br><br>Yet check out these headlines from non-Scottish based media outlets:<br><br>&quot;Celtic shrug off Rangers plane stunt&quot;<br><br>&quot;Celtic manager Neil Lennon unfazed by Rangers flyover stunt&quot;<br><br>The  Scottish media outlets had a field day last season with the number of  incidents that revolved around the Celtic and Neil Lennon. And by all  accounts it looks as though they are looking to continue this, by  fuelling the flames of hate that burn between the Lurgan man and Rangers  supporters.<br><br>In the 11 years that Lennon has been at Celtic, not once  did any newspaper outlet publish an article condemning the attacks or  threats on Lennon. They used it to fuel stories, with pundits giving  their opinions on why Lennon brought it upon himself, and that given he  lives in the goldfish bowl of Glasgow, he should stay indoors. Comments  coming from former players who boozed it up to the early hours when they  were at Celtic or Rangers in the 1970s and 80s, even those who haven&#39;t  kick a ball in anger as a professional got in on the act, trying to take  the moral high ground.<br><br>It was only after the Scottish Government,  the Police, the Westminster government got involved that the media then  changed their tune and denounced those targeting Lennon, all the while  trying to ignore the years of abuse and hatred that they tried to blame  on Lennon himself.<br><br>Most officials, fans and football personalities  hope and prey that Neil Lennon does not go through a season like he did  last season. However you can bet on the Editors and the bean counters in  Scotland&#39;s mainstream media, hoping and praying it continues to a  certain degree to sell more papers, to gain more air time.<br><br>Celtic and  Rangers cover 90% of the Scottish Football coverage in our media, and  with Neil Lennon at the helm at Celtic Park the focus will as per usual  for the coming season fall squarely on the shoulders of the Lurgan man.  And with some papers cutting jobs and others losing circulation numbers  dramatically, they will use any trick any angle to sell more copies.<br><br>Maybe this year, maybe this season will be different. Sadly I won&#39;t be counting my chickens that&#39;s for sure. 						 						 						<br><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>  </h3> <h3>   </h3><h3>  </h3><h3>Fan cleared of assault on Lennon and sectarian slur</h3>The Herald<br><br> &lsquo;MOMENT OF MADNESS&rsquo;: John Wilson ran on to the pitch and was grabbed by coach Alan Thompson before falling.
