It was a thunderbolt of a shot that almost burst the net, and was to be his signature style. He was a tall strong physical striker, and wasn&#39;t afraid to use his strength to get the upper hand on the opposition. This helped him in the air for headers and on the ground in challenges, and in effect he was scoring bags of goals for the first team.<br><br>He was a productive striker from the start and was to make a good name for himself in his first season, which was capped by his goal against Airdrie which gave Celtic the Scottish Cup, our first trophy since 1989, and a time to celebrate after the long Barren Years. He&#39;d signed himself into the Celtic history books with that goal, a favourite of all. He later admitted that it was after this match when he saw the celebrations and tears from his fellow players that he understood what the club meant to all.<br><br>The man known as &#39;Huggy&#39; went on to score 32 goals in total in his first full season at the club. Manager Tommy Burns said of his star signing: &quot;<i>I didn&#39;t expect him to have any problems fitting into Scottish football, but he has added a silky touch and his goal ratio was very good</i>&quot;. Hooijdonk&#39;s skill had not gone unnoticed and Dutch side Feyenoord even made a &pound;2m bid for him in April 1996 which thankfully was knocked back.<br><br>Their coach Arie Hann said: &quot;Van Hooijdonk&#39;s prolific goalscoring has put him in an elite group. He was one of the best around and his talent has attracted attention.&quot; When a player scores as much as he did, who would not notice?<br><br>He was to play a pivot role for the club, and slotted in well with Di Canio &amp; Jorge Cadette for a classic attacking line in the 1996-97 side which put the fear into everyone, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. It wowed and entertained the crowds, and the attack was ferocious yet we still loss the league despite a great record, and Rangers in the head-to-head matches had the upper hand, mainly as whilst the attack was strong this came at the cost of a focus on defence. Many look back with price on that season for the great attacking football of which Pierre was a huge part.<br><br>Sadly, it all went to his head and amidst controversy Pierre left Celtic for Nottingham Forrest in 1997. He was infamously known to bicker about his wages, which didn&#39;t go well with the our thrifty chairman at the time (Fergus McCann). Van Hooijdonk&#39;s time was finished when he went on Radio and stated that &quot;&pound;7,000 may be good for a homeless person, but &pound;7,000 a week is not good enough for a top class forward&quot;. Stupid, crass, pathetic and unnecessary comment, and he had to go. You can&#39;t negotiate with a person after remarks like that. <br><br>After 92 games with an exceptional goal return of 56 goals, it was all over and despite all the great goals and great achievements, he was to be tagged with that crass remark in the history books. <br><br>Similar stupidity followed him when he controversially went on strike at his next club, Notts Forest, before being transferred back home to Holland. Controversy did damage his career, at one point he claimed that George Graham (Arsenal manager) wanted to sign him from Notts Forest, only for George Graham to retort back that there was no truth in it and didn&#39;t want the hassle from Pierre as had marked his time at Notts Forest. You reap what you sow. His career could have been so much more, although there are many high points too. <br><br>In later years Pierre seems to have matured as a person and was good enough to come back over to Glasgow for Tommy Burn&#39;s funeral. He also returned and played in the Tommy Burn&#39;s Tribute match whereby he and Jorge Cadete played very well although both were long retired and approaching 40 years of age. Pierre really seemed to enjoy his time back amongst the Celtic fans and admitted he regretted having left Celtic when he did and also in the manner he did. For that we&#39;ll respect him.<br><br><b>Post Celtic Career<br></b>Though relegated in his first season with Nottingham Forest he pledged to stay with them and helped in no small part to win promotion again to the English Premier Division in 98/99. Forest though failed to invest in the team and <img align="right" alt="Pierre Van Hooijdonk - Kerrydale Street" height="262" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/wiki/kds/image/1vtt6n6lbUKxYIJZqfAXThA==11308/GW155H262" title="Pierre Van Hooijdonk - Kerrydale Street" width="155">Van Hooijdonk asked for a transfer. The club refused. Pierre felt &quot;betrayed&quot; by what he thought had been a deal with the management and announced his intention to strike. He kept fit by training with his former club NAC Breda. Nottingham Forest refused to listen to offers for him despite their need for both a striker or the cash from his sale. <br><br>At the end of the 98/99 season he returned to the Netherlands with Vitesse Arnhem to continue his career and did much to convince his critics of his goal-scoring abilities when he helped the Arnhem team to a UEFA Cup spot with 25 goals in one season.<br><br>Van Hooijdonk then signed a three year deal with Benfica in 2000. He eventually only played one season for them with 19 goals. At Benfica he faced the same problems as he faced at Nottingham Forest with the team going through three different managers in the season. The new chairman at Benfica had no faith in Van Hooijdonk and dropped him. <br><br>At the end of the 2000/2001 season, he signed for his fourth Dutch club, Feyenoord, where he made his name for his amazing free kick abilities and helped them to the UEFA Cup in 2002.<br><br>Never one to settle down, van Hooijdonk joined Fenerbahce at the beginning of the 2003-04 season where he featured in 52 games for the Turkish club and scored 32 goals (24 in his first season). He won league title medals for the Turkish First Football League in 2003-04 and 2004-05. He is still one of their supporters&#39; most popular and beloved former players.<br><br>In mid-2005, he re-signed for his first club, NAC, playing 17 games but scoring only 5 goals. During the winter transfer window of the 05/06 season, he re-signed for Feyenoord, where he scored 8 goals in 37 appearances.<br><br>On October 18, 2006 Van Hooijdonk announced his retirement was to be at the end of the 2006-07 season. On May 13, 2007 he played his final professional match, a draw against FC Groningen in the end of season play-offs.<br><br>Despite all the dramas throughout his career, he has much to look back on with some fondness.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td

Quotes</h3>In 2014, ex-Rangers goalkeeper Andy Goram, when opening a pub, spoke of an altercation with Pierre van Hooijdonk in an Old Firm match in 1996. He told a cheering group of Rangers fans that when he saved the Dutchman&#39;s penalty in that game he went up to him and called him &ndash; and he was paraphrasing here &ndash;   <br><i>&quot;a non-white, unclean, non-Protestant with no father&quot;. </i><br><b>On Andy Goram (2015) <br>(source: https://www.scotsman.com/sport/tom-english-the-self-pitying-goram-still-sees-himself-as-the-victim-1-1362600)</b><br><br>&quot;Scoring the winning goal in that final and seeing the joy and happiness of the fans and players made me realise how important it was for Celtic after six years without a trophy. <br>&quot;I remember everything about the goal. A ball was kicked away and it ended up at the feet of Tosh McKinlay who put an early cross in towards the back post. I jumped just a little bit higher than my opponent and headed a diagonal header into the ground and it went into the far corner.<br>&quot;The moment when I really realised what it all meant was when the game finished and I saw Paul McStay and Peter Grant, two real Celtic men, crying on the pitch and hugging each other for 10 or 15 minutes, that&acute;s when I realised what this club meant.&quot;<br><b>Pierre Van Hooijdonk (May 2013)<br><br></b>&quot;Pierre wasn&#39;t well known before we bought him from NAC Breda. <br>&quot;But his head got very big very soon after he arrived in Glasgow. <br>&quot;I&#39;m not surprised by what&#39;s happened to any of them [The Three Amigos].

It is genuinely funny as, in the lobby of an Amsterdam hotel, he tries in vain to collapse his 6ft 4in frame into something resembling Big Ron. The Dutchman&rsquo;s accent and intonation, however, are spot on as we discuss his final few months under Atkinson at Nottingham Forest in 1998-99, when the club was relegated from the Premier League. They have not been back since.</span><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Despite being bottom of the league, Ron had just appeared in a Carling advert as some sort of clueless medieval king who had just discovered football,&rdquo; Van Hooijdonk says. &ldquo;I remember one training session afterwards where I was pissed off with the whole situation and I cursed loudly. Ron replied: &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t like it, why don&rsquo;t you **** off?&rsquo; So I did, and as I walked off the training pitch I shouted: &lsquo;The only reason they asked you on that beer ad is because you are the biggest pub manager in the country.&rsquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Later that afternoon, Ron called me at home to come and see him in his office. He was smiling and said: &lsquo;I liked your joke. A couple more games are left, you can leave after that, just give your best.&rsquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;We laughed it off. Ron was a people person and I can imagine him doing better with the right group of players. He was funny, warm, even if his tactical approach was the same as Dave Bassett&rsquo;s. And all the players were pissing themselves when he got into the wrong dugout in his first game in charge.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It proved a rare moment of lightness in a turbulent time for Forest and Van Hooijdonk, who had fired the club to the 1997-98 First Division title the previous season with 34 goals, scored at the World Cup for the Netherlands and then spent the first few months of the next season on strike after failing to secure a move away from Forest.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Karel Poborsky: &lsquo;They put me into a coma. All my face muscles were paralysed&rsquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Read more</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;The thing that started all that was after the World Cup Newcastle and Ruud Gullit came in with a &pound;7m bid, twice what Forest had paid,&rdquo; Van Hooijdonk says. &ldquo;But Bassett told the papers my price was &pound;10m. Ten million! In 1998, that&rsquo;s like putting a price tag on a bottle of water and asking for &pound;25. Officially it&rsquo;s for sale but it&rsquo;s not for sale.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Van Hooijdonk would not play in the first team until November, eventually reintegrated by a now‑desperate Bassett, who would be sacked and replaced by Atkinson two months later. Van Hooijdonk is withering in his assessment of the former Wimbledon manager.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Bassett&rsquo;s training was primitive. We played five-a-side most of the time. We would do drills where the goalkeeper, Dave Beasant, was playing up front. Bassett wasn&rsquo;t there most of the time. Then, on a Friday, he would turn up. Before matches we would just go to an Italian restaurant opposite the City Ground. We could order what we wanted: chicken wings, carbonara with loads of sauce, french fries, whatever.&rdquo;</span><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Bassett was not the only obstacle for Van Hooijdonk. Some players publicly made their feelings known about the Dutchman, and in one game refused to celebrate one of his goals. While Van Hooijdonk was on strike, Steve Stone said he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t give a **** what Pierre does next&rdquo; and said the striker was not welcome in the dressing room. &ldquo;Why was it that no foreign player at Forest was interviewed?&rdquo; Van Hooijdonk says. &ldquo;To this day, there is not one foreign player from my time at Forest that has said something bad about me.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;When I returned that November, I called a meeting with the players in the dressing room, explained the reasons I stayed away in bullet-point form and asked if anyone had any questions. That was their time to say something, face to face. All the guys who said something when I was away stayed quiet. Only one person, Geoff Thomas, said he didn&rsquo;t agree with me. And I respected Geoff for that.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;People can say I went on strike but I believe nobody can say that as a colleague and a professional I was an *******.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Forest were understandably reluctant to let Van Hooijdonk go. He was the club&rsquo;s best striker since Stan Collymore and Teddy Sheringham, a two-footed, world-class set-piece specialist, and did not look out of place alongside Dennis Bergkamp and Patrick Kluivert in an orange shirt. He eventually left for Vitesse Arnhem in the summer of 1999 for &pound;3.5m.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He had arrived at Forest from Celtic, with his spell in Glasgow also controversial. &ldquo;In Scotland, every day the papers are on you, mad for Celtic and Rangers. But at Forest, it was not the same. I didn&rsquo;t miss the attention but you noticed the difference.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Pierre van Hooijdonk led Nottingham Forest to promotion in 1997-98.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Facebook</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Twitter</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Pinterest</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Pierre van Hooijdonk helped Nottingham Forest gain promotion to the Premier League in 1997-98. Photograph: Ted Blackbrow/Daily Mail/Shutterstock</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;In Glasgow, I was easy to recognise: tall and dark. I got some trouble from Rangers fans; once at some traffic lights a boy opened my car door and spat at me. It sucked the energy out of me.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I was single for six months there but didn&rsquo;t go out because I had to be careful. If I went to a concert, I would take a taxi and crouch down in the back seat as we went past the pubs. Even when I was playing for Fenerbahce with the Galatasaray fans or for Benfica with the Porto fans, the danger was never as bad.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Lothar Matth&auml;us: &lsquo;With Putin I talked football, judo and Brexit&#39;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Read more</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Van Hooijdonk made an immediate impact for Celtic, scoring a famous 1995 Scottish Cup final winner &ndash; the club&rsquo;s first trophy for six years &ndash; and the next season would be the league&rsquo;s top scorer with 26 goals. Paolo Di Canio and Jorge Cadete would later join to form a frontline known as the Three Amigos.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;When I arrived at Celtic in 1994 I was not impressed with the quality,&rdquo; Van Hooijdonk says. &ldquo;But when Andreas Thom joined, then Jorge and Paolo, the difference in level was unbelievable. It was a great partnership.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;John Collins had taken me to his home for dinner when I had joined, so when the other foreigners arrived I did the same. Andreas at the time was smoking cigarettes and so was my wife, so he felt safe at my home. He was from East Germany; they are a little bit different, more suspicious.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Paolo also came round. At the &lsquo;96 Olympics the volleyball final was between Holland and Italy. I said to him after training that he should come to my house to watch. It was my first time meeting him properly and I thought he was going to be relaxed, but he was on the floor, rolling around, screaming with passion at every point. Paolo was a funny guy &ndash; he once called a team meeting because Andreas had not passed the ball to him.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Pierre Van Hooijdonk beats Dunfermline keeper Ian Westwater to score for Celtic in 1996.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Di Canio, Cadete and Van Hooijdonk would all leave Celtic in acrimony, with the Dutchman falling out with the chairman, Fergus McCann, over a new contract, declaring Celtic&rsquo;s offer of &pound;7,000 a week was &ldquo;enough for the homeless but not for an international striker&rdquo; in 1996.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">John Scales: &lsquo;I punched a hole in the wall when I had to leave Liverpool&rsquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Read more</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;Our best players were on five‑figure sums per week and I was not,&rdquo; Van Hooijdonk says. &ldquo;McCann said if I did well he would raise my salary. I became top scorer but he never offered me the same money as the others. I&rsquo;m a man of my word.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Van Hooijdonk&rsquo;s goal record is astonishing: 335 in 551 games, including at least a goal every other game for seven clubs between 1991 and 2005. His pinnacle was the Uefa Cup triumph with an unfancied Feyenoord in 2002, alongside a young Robin van Persie. Van Hooijdonk scored in every knockout round, including two goals in the final (in Rotterdam) against Borussia Dortmund, one a trademark free-kick.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Remarkably, at 49, Van Hooijdonk plays for a Sunday league team. He is still besotted by football and easy to talk to: about how he spent his pocket money as a kid on hiring a sports hall because it had a goal with a net, or about Harry Kane, or his 19-year-old son, Sydney van Hooijdonk, a striker for his hometown club, NAC Breda.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Articulate and passionate, it is perhaps unsurprising he works as a TV pundit in the Netherlands. It allowed him to visit Glasgow last month for Feyenoord&rsquo;s match against Rangers, where he paid tribute to his former teammate Fernando Ricksen at Ibrox.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd"> Pierre van Hooijdonk (@pierrevh17)</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">#fernandoricksen pic.twitter.com/vML0GOVIqN</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> September 19, 2019</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">&ldquo;I knew Fernando through the national team and could not miss out on the opportunity to show my respects,&rdquo; he says.</span><br><br><div><span class="diffAdd">It seems some of the Glasgow confrontation has died down. &ldquo;Some Rangers fans even said hello to me.&rdquo; </span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tbody><span class="diffAdd">  </span><tr><span class="diffAdd">  </span><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span></h3></div><div></div></div>
