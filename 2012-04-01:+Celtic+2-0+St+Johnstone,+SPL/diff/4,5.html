Lomas set them up well and they  did create some well worked chances so Celtic were never realistically  gonna roll them over. <br><br>Samaras, Brown and Mulgrew were excellent today. <br><br>When  did we become so effective from set pieces? I can remember most people  on here moaning about getting 15 corners in a match and earning nothing  from them. Commons delivery was superb. <br><br>Dreadful passing for the  best part. Ki was the right move but I&#39;d have hooked Stokes or Hooper  before Lustig. Like we need another RB to get us goals. <br><br>One  thing I did notice today was the lack of pace from our CB&#39;s. If we are  to succeed in Europe next season then we need to sign good CB&#39;s. Its  almost comical any Celtic manager has failed to sign a quality CB. <br><br>Officials  were gash. Again Stokes fell victim to the phantom offside rule that  exists only for Celtic players. Samaras was decked in the box twice  under more contact than Cha on Wallace&#39;y. <br><br>Out of sight. Champions. Next week will be a fitting end to a remarkable season.  						 						 						 					<br><br>(Jungle G of KDS)<br>Not quite a non-event but definitely a bit of an anti-climax after the  huns last min winner the day before put the title party on hold. <br><br>Lots  of day-trippers who decided this would be their one match of the year  to attend and were probably thinking all week they&#39;d won a watch with  the weather also looking fine for a trophy presentation, so nae luck to  the part-timers, but there&#39;s always this time next year if not even  sooner. <br><br>First 15 mins of the second half marked by the usual  murmurs and increasingly vocal grumbling of the home crowd in matches  against diddy teams we aren&#39;t winning handsomely enough for the zoomers  but thankfully Sammy capped a decent performance and helped stop the  whinging in its tracks with a great header and fizzing low drive that  delivered the opener and helped create that &#39;crucial&#39; second  respectively.<br><br>We were 5/10 for the first hour and 7/10 once we  got the goal to settle us. Won it with plenty to spare. To be fair looks  like it&#39;s a bit more of a struggle for this young team to fire  themselves up to the extent they can match the peak levels of a couple  of months back, now that the long unbeaten run is over, the league a  formality and fatigue has probably kicked in at the same time the  adrenalin levels subside a bit. <br><br>I&#39;m not too fussed by that but do hope we can get motoring somewhat again ahead of the 29th at least.<br><br>Not  convinced by starting XI and again concerned to see NL second guessing  his own set-up before long at all (switching Samaras and Commons). <br><br>Hooper and Stokes on totally different wavelengths. <br><br>Commons  emerged in the last half hour with some very smart long-range passing  but was lethargic from the start and still only looks a shadow of last  year&#39;s game-changer. <br><br>In defence we had little to do though Rogne  made heavy weather of a few bouncing balls without every being caught  out. Lustig was diligent doesn&#39;t have anything like the attacking  instincts of other full-backs at the club so it was hard to judge the  guy with the team in pedestrian mode.<br><br>Re Sammy, MOTM but still  reckon he flatters to deceive. A standout in an ordinary game against  sluggish opponents. Great headed finish though and perfect choice of  final ball to force an own goal. He&#39;s very important to us right now but  remain unconvinced we shouldn&#39;t be open about selling him if it&#39;s one  of the moves that helps bring in the mythical attacker who can both mix  it up for us in terms of playing style, AND score prolifically.  I await  the &quot;unplayable on his day&quot; remarks - if any of those days arrive  during the Euros we should still be open about cashing in whilst his  value is at a high. <br><br>Various tributes to Petrov were the highlight of the day. Win that fight, Stan, YNWA. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><h3>  Celtic</h3>01 Forster<br>21 Mulgrew<br>22 Loovens<br>23 Lustig (Matthews - 55&#39; )<br>25 Rogne<br>08 Brown<br>16 Ledley<br>09 Samaras<br>10 Stokes (Ki Sung-Yeung - 63&#39; )<br>15 Commons<br>88 Hooper (Blackman - 87&#39; )<br><br>Substitutes<br>24 Zaluska<br>03 Izaguirre<br>06 Wilson<br>39 Blackman<br>02 Matthews<br>18 Ki Sung-Yeung<br>46 McGeouch<br><br>Goals<br><ul><li>Samaras 66&prime;</li><li>Millar (og) 70&prime;</li></ul><h3>St Johnstone</h3>15 Mannus<br>02 MacKay<br>05 Wright<br>12 Maybury Booked<br>18 McCracken<br>04 Morris (Moon - 85&#39; )<br>07 Millar<br>09 Croft Booked (Oyenuga - 90&#39; )<br>10 Craig Booked<br>11 Sheridan<br>21 Sandaza<br><br><b>Substitutes</b><br>01 Enckelman<br>06 Anderson<br>31 Moffat<br>14 Moon<br>16 Robertson<br>36 Greg Mitchell<br>22 Oyenuga<br><br><br><b>Ref</b>: Salmond<br><b>Att</b>: 57,848    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Articles </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  Match Report (see end of page below)<br></li><li class="MsoNormal"><a class="external" href="http://celticfanmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/PR-2012-04-01-St-Johnstone.mp3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="diffAdd">Audio Report: Paradise Report</span></a></li></ul>  <h3>  Pictures </h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a href="/page/2012-04-01%3A+Celtic+2-0+St+Johnstone%2C+SPL+-+Pictures" target="_self">Match Pictures </a></li></ul>  <h3>  Forum</h3>  <ul>  <li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8666493/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pre-match   </a></li><li class="MsoNormal">  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8669394/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Match</a>   </li><li>  <a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8669415/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Post Match</a></li></ul><h3>MOTM</h3> <ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8669414/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Voting Thread</a><br>   </li><li>Result Thread</li><li>Winner - <br></li><li><a href="/page/KDS+MOTM+Winners+2011%2F12" target="_self">2011-12 Winners</a></li></ul>     <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Stats</h3><h3>Celtic v St Johnstone                      </h3><h3>Possession</h3>59 v 41<br><h3>Shots</h3><div class="match-stats-bar">             <div class="stats-bar">                                     14                             v 4                             </div><h3>             On target             </h3><div class="stats-bar short">                                     8                             v 0                             </div>         </div>         <div class="match-stats-bar">             <h3>Corners</h3>             <div class="stats-bar">                                     4 v                            7                             </div>         </div>         <div class="match-stats-bar">             <h3>Fouls</h3>             <div class="stats-bar">                                     4                             v 11                             </div>         </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>  Celtic 2 - 0 St Johnstone: &lsquo;Stan&rsquo; together as club focus on Petrov</h3>The Scotsman<br><br>By ALAN PATTULLO<br>Published on Monday 2 April 2012 03:26<br><br>CELTIC Park did not have the opportunity to stand and honour the title winners. Instead, those gathered inside the stadium rose to applaud the fight being waged by Stiliyan Petrov, the former Celtic midfielder diagnosed with acute leukaemia at the end of last week.<br><br>This show of support was choreographed for the 19th minute, the number of shirt which the man known as Stan wore both at current club Aston Villa and during his distinguished days at Parkhead, footage from which was shown at half-time.<br><br>The Celtic coaching staff also displayed the fact that their thoughts were with their former team-mate by wearing training tops bearing the name Petrov across the shoulders and his squad number on the back.<br><br>Rightly, there was barely an acknowledgement of what might have been had Rangers not grabbed a last-gasp winner against Motherwell the previous day. Those who remained until the final whistle afforded their heroes a quick cheer and then departed into the afternoon. Next stop, Rugby Park.<br><br>This would not have been the day for a party whatever had happened at Fir Park. The focus returned to Celtic&rsquo;s own efforts yesterday after some Petrov-inspired reflection. At the moment, it is a rather brutal light which has to be trained on the champions-elect, who were unimpressive again yesterday after a run of only one win in four away outings.<br><br>Yet the win gained on this return to Parkhead, earned through a header by Georgios Samaras and an own goal by St Johnstone midfielder Chris Millar, sets up the possibility of a title coronation at Rugby Park in six days&rsquo; time. Celtic know that another victory, or draw, will seal a championship win viewed as inevitable since the day Rangers entered administration. Deprived of bona fide challengers, Celtic have resorted to making it hard for themselves.<br><br>The visitors will rue a brace of near misses at the start of the second half as St Johnstone attempted to catch Celtic cold after holding their hosts in the opening 45 minutes. Cillian Sherdan&rsquo;s header past the post, following Dave Mackay&rsquo;s cross, was possibly the best opportunity. Fran Sandaza then sent a looping header just over.<br><br>Manager Steve Lomas also lamented a series of key decisions by referee George Salmond which he felt had gone against his side. He wanted a penalty for a body-check on Sandaza in the second-half and he also complained about the soft nature of the free kick, for David McCracken&rsquo;s barge into Samaras, from which Celtic opened the scoring. His list of grievances was completed by what was an admittedly flagrant foul on Liam Craig by Kris Commons in the run-up to the home team&rsquo;s game-sealing secong goal, &lsquo;claimed&rsquo; by the unfortunate Millar.<br><br>With the league title celebrations on hold for another time and place, attention fell on the race for the Champions League qualifying place. It is a contest which has been ignited by Motherwell&rsquo;s defeat by Rangers on Saturday, coupled with the good form of both St Johnstone and Dundee United.<br><br>The capture of Derek Riordan could come to be viewed as a canny piece of business if the Perth side are able to secure third spot. The former Hibs player was not named in the squad yesterday, although he looked on from the main stand. Instead, St Johnstone relied on a team of old dependables who had managed to put together a remarkable run of just two defeats in 17 away matches prior to kick-off yesterday. Despite playing with only one striker in the recent clash at St Mirren, Lomas opted for his usal front pairing in Sandaza and former Celtic man Sheridan. &ldquo;Not many teams come here and play two up front,&rdquo; commented Lomas afterwards.<br><br>St Johnstone can clearly scent history in the air as they take note of Motherwell&rsquo;s stumbling form. They could and perhaps should have taken something from Parkhead, where they collected all three points on their previous visit earlier in the season.<br><br>The visitors were clearly not afraid to have a go and kept the ball well in the opening half. Scoring opportunities were few and far between. Commons&rsquo; angled shot slipped past the post after Anthony Stokes had dinked a ball into his path. But the best chance fell just before half time as Charlie Mulgrew sought to sweep the ball into the net after a Commons free-kick created chaos in the box, and left goalkeeper Alan Mannus in a heap on the ground. Frazer Wright, however, was perfectly placed on the line to clear and then made a commendable block to follow up as Stokes tried to rifle in the rebound.<br><br>St Johnstone&rsquo;s game-plan was likely based around preventing Celtic scoring in the first half. This aim duly achieved, they set about hurting their opponents at the start of the second half. The hosts were strangely subdued as first Sheridan flicked a header past and then Sandaza looped an effort over the bar.<br><br>Neil Lennon quickly sought to give his side more impetus, switching home debutant Mikael Lustig for Adam Matthews after only 55 minutes. Scott Brown then sent a deflected shot narrowly wide before Commons saw his looping effort tipped over by Mannus. Commons, clearly relishing his return to favour under Lennon, then turned provider as his delivery was headed into the net by Samaras, after 66 minutes.<br><br>It seemed a sadly uncomplicated way for St Johnstone to go behind following the investment of so much energy since kick-off. They might well have equalised only three minutes later if not for a last-ditch clearance by Matthews at the far post, with Craig waiting to pounce on a Lee Croft cross.<br><br>Just a minute later came the game-sealing goal, though no-one will convince Lomas that it should have been allowed to be scored after Commons bundled Craig over in the Celtic half. The home side took advantage of the fact there was no whistle and quickly broke upfield. Samaras&rsquo; dangerous cross, after a lay-off by Ki, was turned into his own net by Millar as he made a desperate attempt to clear.<br><br>St Johnstone might have at least scored with three minutes remaining, but Sandaza&rsquo;s half-cleared cross fell to Craig&rsquo;s wrong foot, and he blazed over. Although there was not even the consolation of a goal on this occasion, the visitors know there is still much to play for in the coming weeks. Celtic, too, move on with relish.  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>Celtic 2<br><br> Samaras 66&prime;<br> Millar (og) 70&prime;<br><br>Team badge of St Johnstone<br>St Johnstone 0<br><br> 90 +4<br> HT 0-0<br><br>Use accessible player and disable flyout menus<br><br>1 April 2012 Last updated at 14:50<br><br> Share<br> Facebook<br> Twitter<br><br> print<br><br>By Clive Lindsay BBC Scotland<br><br>Georgios Samaras inspired Celtic to a victory over a stubborn St Johnstone that takes Neil Lennon&#39;s side to within a point of the Scottish title.<br><br>Frazer Wright headed a Charlie Mulgrew header off the Saints line during a fairly even first half.<br><br>But Samaras powered a header home from Kris Commons&#39; 66th-minute free-kick.<br><br>And, four minutes later, the Greek striker&#39;s low cross was turned into his own net by Chris Millar as Celtic stretched their lead to 18 points.<br><br>Those two goals ended Wright&#39;s amazing record, the defender having started the game with 911 minutes of football behind him without St Johnstone having conceded a goal while he was in their line-up away from home.<br><br>The home side had gone into the game looking to avoid losing three straight domestic games in a row for the first time since 1994.<br><br>However, getting back to winning ways - and ending Saints six-game unbeaten run - means Celtic can now depose second-top Rangers as champions when they visit Kilmarnock on Saturday.<br>Celtic fans sent a message of support to Stilian Petrov<br><br>Celtic fans sent a message of support to Stilian Petrov<br><br>Right-back Mikael Lustig had been handed his home debut, while Commons, Glenn Loovens and Gary Hooper started with Cha Du-ri and Victor Wanyama suspended and Adam Matthews and Ki Sung-Yueng dropped to the bench.<br><br>However, it was Samaras, looking majestic in recent weeks, who was the inspiration as Celtic began at breakneck speed, making their opponents looking a yard slower.<br><br>Unchanged St Johnstone, with former Celtic forward Derek Riordan not even considered fit enough for the bench after being signed as a free agent, steadied themselves and gradually worked themselves into the game.<br><br>The match itself was subdued in comparison to the 19th-minute standing ovation given by the capacity crowd as get-well wishes were sent to former Celtic midfielder Stilian Petrov following news that the Aston Villa No.19 is suffering from acute leukaemia.<br><br>A Commons drive across the face of goal and a 30-yard Liam Craig free-kick pushed away by Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster were the highlights until just before the stroke of half-time.<br>Use accessible player and disable flyout menus<br><br>Wright&#39;s head prevented a goal after Mulgrew got his toe to the ball after goalkeeper Alan Mannus made a hash of clearing a Commons free-kick into the six-yard box and Stokes had his shot blocked on the rebound by the Saints defender.<br><br>Cillian Sheridan headed wide from eight yards when he ought to have hit the target then Francisco Sandaza sent a looping header onto the roof of the net as Saints began the brighter after the break.<br><br>Mannus clawed away a curling Commons effort, but the goalkeeper was left helpless when the winger&#39;s free-kick found the head of Samaras 10 yards out to open the scoring.<br><br>Saints had claims for a penalty rejected moments later when Loovens checked Sandaza&#39;s progress.<br><br>And, as the visitors claimed for a foul for a Commons challenge on Craig, Celtic raced to the other end and Millar diverted a low Samaras cross past Mannus.<br><br>Craig had a blistering free-kick turned over the crossbar by Forster and then fired over with the goal at his mercy after the goalkeeper could only parry a Sandaza cross as Saints applied some belated pressure.<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon : &#39;&#39;Absoulety delighted with that, although we were not at our best in the first half.<br><br>&quot;We wanted a wee bit more intensity to our play, particularly in the froward areas.
