I know it must not have been an easy few weeks for the McGeady family as Aiden made his decision about his international future. As a parent myself I can sympathise because our role is to guide and offer advice and once our children have made their decision, to support. Nobody can give us that training to cope with the stress of it all. Aiden is a very mature and intelligent young man and is a credit to both of you. Bertie and I are so disappointed that he has chosen the Republic over Scotland, but we respect his decision and wish Aiden every success in his career. Scotland&rsquo;s loss is the Republic&rsquo;s gain.<br>Ross Mathie, International youth team manager</i><br><br>A small piece of Irish footballing history contained in one of the scrapbooks compiled by John McGeady, an English teacher by profession but also a skilled archivist, as a visit to his home last Thursday evening in rain-lashed south Glasgow made clear.<br><br>An increasingly rare breed in an industry enveloped by suspicion and secrecy, McGeady was happy to sit back in his living room and open both his scrapbooks and his soul on the achievements of his son, Aiden. Later his 20-year-old son will have his say, but for the time being he has secreted himself elsewhere in the McGeady household, driven out of the room by an innate sense of modesty and reserve.<br><br>&ldquo;Aiden&rsquo;s quite introverted,&rdquo; his father says. &ldquo;It frustrates me at times, because I say to him what little glory I had I loved it. He doesn&rsquo;t. I think he finds it quite difficult speaking to people. He&rsquo;s quite quiet and shy, although in the company of people he knows, he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s absolutely hilarious. Great sense of humour, very funny, very quick-witted.&rdquo;<br><br>The family have just enjoyed such a day, celebrating together the graduation of Aiden&rsquo;s mother, Elaine, who has achieved a diploma in nursing. Those pictures belong in a different scrapbook. Before our eyes, McGeady senior unfolds the early years of a player who could go on to be one of Ireland&rsquo;s outstanding footballers. There&rsquo;s the team photo of Govanhill Cubs, with Aiden standing alongside his cousin who was reared in that tough district of Glasgow and in the front row the smiling figure of a young footballer as brilliant as Aiden, but now serving a life sentence for murder. Another is of Aiden in a green strip during a trip to his grandmother&rsquo;s village in Gweedore in Donegal, where as a 12-year-old boy he had entertained the locals doing keepy uppies with tennis and golf balls. And then there is Aiden in a comically large Arsenal shirt in the company of Liam Brady, during a trip down to the Arsenal training ground when he was 11 or 12.<br><br>&ldquo;This is when Arsenal wanted to sign him,&rdquo; John says. &ldquo;Liam Brady used to fly us down every five or six weeks and Aiden used to play for the Arsenal youth team. They treated us very, very well but I made it clear right from the start that Aiden was never going to England at the age of 16. Brady couldn&rsquo;t believe it when we turned him down. He said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll change your mind&rsquo;. I said, &lsquo;No you won&rsquo;t. Aiden&rsquo;s not going to England.That&rsquo;s it.&rsquo; No matter what financial carrot was dangled in front of him, he wasn&rsquo;t leaving.<br><br>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t let Aiden go down to every Premiership club that wanted to have him down because I witnessed a number of incidents down there that I didn&rsquo;t find particularly attractive. Quite a few parents were sending their sons down to clubs and picking up little presents and being sort of looked after for the weekend. Being wined and dined. That was never my bag and I never wanted to be involved.&rdquo;<br><br>McGeady might appear hands on, pushy even, another case of a father trying to live his life through the achievements of his famous son. Not so, he insists. As a former professional footballer himself &mdash; he made around 35 first-team appearances during an injury-scarred five years at Sheffield United in the 1970s &mdash; he knows enough about the pitfalls of the job to make a point of steering his son in the right direction.<br><br>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want him to be a football player just because I was. I wanted him to explore other avenues, give his best shot at school, which he did. He was a straight As student. There&rsquo;s an awful lot of dads who will their sons on to be football players without having really played the game themselves. And I knew the pitfalls of the game and the lonely moments you have when you have a bad game and you go back to a stranger&rsquo;s house and you sit back and ruminate on what you did that day and there is nobody there to support you. Basically, I wanted Aiden to make the best of what he has, but if Aiden turned around and said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to play football any more, Dad&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d be fine with that.&rdquo;<br><br>While McGeady&rsquo;s scrapbook is bulging, there is no picture of Aiden with a football as a very young boy. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t interested until I was eight or nine,&rdquo; Aiden explains. &ldquo;My friend was going to train with a local team and I joined him. As soon as I started kicking a ball I liked it, but it was a late start.&rdquo;<br><br>His father was having kidney treatment in hospital at the time and returned to be told by his wife that Aiden was out playing with the Busby Boys. &ldquo;I decided I better go down to have a look. I was trying to see through some slats in the fence and all I could see was this blond kid beating people and scoring goals. I thought that Aiden wouldn&rsquo;t have a hope in that company. Then I realised that the kid was Aiden. From that moment on, I knew that life was about to get more complicated.&rdquo;<br><br>Despite his father&rsquo;s reservations, as well as his experiences with Arsenal, McGeady also went south for trials at Manchester City, Blackburn and Manchester United, with Celtic always in the background.<br><br>&ldquo;Celtic didn&rsquo;t have a proper youth development system in place at the time. It was pretty much that you signed for Celtic Boys Club, which had a tenuous link with Celtic Football Club. The boys were playing on clay pitches on a Sunday afternoon, against some local boys, beating them 10 or 12 nil and being given absolute dog&rsquo;s abuse by parents because they were wearing Celtic jerseys. They didn&rsquo;t have any sort of development plan in practice, there was no professional coaching. So that was when we decided to have a look at what English clubs had to offer as far as facilities were concerned and how they looked after and nurtured the youngsters. It was a learning experience for myself and for Aiden in particular and all of a sudden Celtic clicked. They started a youth development system which pretty much brought it up to scratch with English clubs.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic took Aiden on their books when he was 14, training three nights a week and playing at weekends while he continued to attend school. Like several top Premiership clubs, Celtic insisted that their trainees didn&rsquo;t play schools football and the seeds of McGeady&rsquo;s involvement with Ireland were then sown. The Scottish Schools FA insisted that players representing their under-age sides play schools football and McGeady fell through the net as a result.<br><br>&ldquo;When I was 15 I wanted to play for Scotland but I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; McGeady says. &ldquo;Then Packie Bonner phoned and asked me to go over training with Ireland and I thought, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the harm in that?&rsquo; I did quite well and got asked back and got to know the system really well and the boys. When I broke into the first team at Celtic there was all the drama about why I had picked Ireland rather than Scotland, but I already knew the set-up and wasn&rsquo;t going to change my mind.&rdquo; This despite the fact that Scotland once named him in a squad for an under-17s match against Northern Ireland and Berti Vogts, then the Scotland manager, invited Aiden and his father into a meeting at his office in Hampden Park.<br><br>&ldquo;I felt we should attend out of courtesy,&rdquo; John says. &ldquo;He said, &lsquo;Play for Scotland, stay at home, don&rsquo;t play for a foreign nation,&rsquo; which I found somewhat ironic coming from a German in charge of the Scottish international team. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, he was a nice guy, but Aiden was always going to play for Ireland.&rdquo;<br><br>Others in Scotland weren&rsquo;t quite so nice about it. While the Celtic captain Neil Lennon has received far worse abuse, McGeady has been routinely booed at several away grounds since he made his Celtic debut. And sections of the Scottish media refuse to let the issue lie.<br><br>&ldquo;I made my Ireland debut when I was 18 and now I&rsquo;m 20, but it&rsquo;s still brought up. Obviously it&rsquo;s annoying when you get booed every time you touch the ball, but it&rsquo;s not anything I can&rsquo;t handle. It&rsquo;s just part and parcel of football. I suppose everybody&rsquo;s got their own opinion and a lot of Scottish supporters think I&rsquo;m wrong playing for Ireland, but it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what they think, to be honest with you.&rdquo;<br><br>McGeady remembers being interviewed by Stuart Lovell of Setanta Sports after he was made man of the match when Celtic beat Falkirk at the beginning of October.<br><br>&ldquo;He said something like, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be going away with Ireland next week. You must be looking forward to that. Any regrets playing for Ireland now that Scotland are doing so well?&rsquo; Any time Ireland start doing badly and Scotland start doing well, it comes up again.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny how it works that way. There was this guy who played for Motherwell last year, Brian McLean. He signed from Rangers and he declared for Northern Ireland and played a few games for them. His grandparents were from Northern Ireland, or so they thought. He doesn&rsquo;t get the same stick that I get. And it turns out his grandparents aren&rsquo;t from Northern Ireland and he doesn&rsquo;t play for them any more.&rdquo;<br><br>McLean, of course, has nothing like the talent McGeady has. Adidas recognised McGeady&rsquo;s special qualities when he was 13, when they signed him up for a boot deal. As well as Brady, Sir Alex Ferguson also made a personal bid to take him down south. Nor did McGeady ever doubt his own abilities. His father has described him as &ldquo;petulant&rdquo; in his first professional season at Celtic at the age of 16 and McGeady accepts the criticism.<br><br>&ldquo;I was saying to myself, &lsquo;I am going to play in the first team this season,&rsquo; but I wasn&rsquo;t ready. The coaches were saying to me, &lsquo;You just have to be patient, patient.&rsquo; And I was like, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be patient. When you look at guys like Wayne Rooney, they&rsquo;re not patient, are they?&rsquo; It happened without me realising it really. I was patient and eventually I got in the first team.&rdquo;<br><br>Three weeks after his 18th birthday, he scored on his debut for Celtic against Hearts and was voted man of the match. Nine months later he was clapped off the pitch by Alessandro Nesta of AC Milan after a Champions League game and he has proved his appetite for big games by being consistently excellent in Old Firm matches. It would appear, however, that he has yet to convince Gordon Strachan that he has the consistency to guarantee a regular first-team slot. He made a brilliant start to this season, but had a poor game when Celtic travelled to Old Trafford in the Champions League in September and found himself as an unused substitute when Manchester United came to Celtic Park on Tuesday for the return leg.<br><br>&ldquo;I was very disappointed. All the lads were celebrating in the dressing room afterwards, but I found it difficult. It wasn&rsquo;t that I didn&rsquo;t feel part of it because I played in most of the qualifying games. You want to play in the big games and they don&rsquo;t come much bigger than that. It put us through in the Champions League for the first time in our history. I was happy, but it was just frustrating.&rdquo;<br><br>Injuries have intervened at crucial times in his quest for a regular first team place. Last season he was out for 10 weeks with a ligament injury and could only force his way back in when Celtic won the title in early April against Hearts. While on Ireland duty in October, he went over on his ankle, missing three games, and has only featured intermittently in the Premierleague since.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just frustrating that I&rsquo;ve not got back because I think I was playing the best football of my career. I played in every single game until I got injured and then I was out of the team. I&rsquo;ve not really featured much at all. Five minutes here and there. I know what I&rsquo;ve got to do to get back in. Keep working hard. The old clich&eacute;, really. Get my head down.&rdquo;<br><br>Well, not all the time. McGeady will be closely watching how Shaun Maloney&rsquo;s contract dispute with Celtic unravels over the next couple of months. Although McGeady can play on the right wing or in the &ldquo;hole&rdquo; &mdash; his favourite position &mdash; he has been pitted against Maloney over the left-midfield slot. Maloney, whose contract is up in the summer, will be free to talk to other clubs come January, while McGeady&rsquo;s own contract situation is also coming under the spotlight. His has 18 months left to run and Celtic are believed to have made an initial offer to extend it, but McGeady&rsquo;s progress under Strachan will have a huge bearing on whether the player will be seen at Celtic Park in his prime.<br><br>Martin Jol at Tottenham has publicly expressed his interest in the player, while McGeady, perhaps inevitably, has also been linked with re-joining Martin O&rsquo;Neill at Aston Villa. If Strachan doesn&rsquo;t consider McGeady to be his type of player, he would be wise to ship him on in the January transfer window, when Celtic could command a fee in the region of &pound;5m. The player himself would clearly like to test his talents in the Premiership. &ldquo;Eventually that is something that I would like to do,&rdquo; McGeady says. &ldquo;Every player has got aspirations to play in other leagues and do other things with their career, but I&rsquo;m happy at Celtic just now.&rdquo;<br><br>Should push come to shove, he is ready to fly the nest. And this time his father won&rsquo;t stop him. <br><i><br>Source: S Times Nov 2006</i><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%">  <b><u><br></u></b></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>McGeady seals Moscow move</h3></div>  (UKPA) &ndash;  45 minutes ago Aiden McGeady has joined Spartak Moscow from Celtic on a  four-year contract, the Scottish club have confirmed.The  Republic of  Ireland international had been linked with a move to  England, but will  now head to eastern Europe in a deal believed to be  close to  &pound;10million.McGeady told Celtic&#39;s official website: &quot;I  would like to  take this opportunity to thank everyone at Celtic Football  Club for  making my time here so enjoyable and memorable.

It&#39;s good business for Spartak and good business for us.&quot; <br><br>McGeady&#39;s   departure will provide Lennon with funds to bolster his squad and may   see Celtic revive their interest in Stoke winger Liam Lawrence. <br><br>The money generated from the record transfer could also help facilitate a loan move for Manchester City forward Craig Bellamy. <br><br>However, speaking on Thursday, the manager expressed sadness at losing such a talented player.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sorry to lose him, he is one of the entertainers in the game,&quot; said Lennon. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll   probably miss out on his peak years but he came to us and said that he   felt at the end of the season it would be better for him to move on. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s difficult to stand in the way of someone who doesn&#39;t want to be here.&quot; <br><br>One   player hoping to benefit from McGeady&#39;s exit is Pat McCourt, a winger   who has been on the fringes of the first team for two seasons now. <br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve probably lost the best player in the league,&quot; said the Northern Ireland international of McGeady. <br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s going to be a big hole. But it&#39;s up to someone to step up to the plate and fill it. <br><br>&quot;It&#39;s   up to whoever gets a shout and gets the jersey to hold on to it, and   I&#39;m hoping it&#39;ll be me. This year&#39;s the year I really want to kick on   and be a regular in the side.&quot; <br><br>Spartak, managed by former   Russian World Cup star Valery Karpin, lie in eighth position in the   Russian Premier League, having won only five of their 15 matches. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>The right choices on the field, and brave ones off it, have led Aiden McGeady to leave Celtic</h3>10 Aug 2010<br>link:   http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/celtic/the-right-choices-on-the-field-and-brave-ones-off-it-have-led-aiden-mcgeady-to-leave-celtic-1.1047162<br><br> 	                    It is a big decision but it was taken by a personality who has never shied away from making them.<br><br>  	  	                	                Aiden  McGeady will almost  certainly sign for Spartak Moscow this week after  travelling yesterday  to undergo a medical in Frankfurt. The collapse of  his move to Aston  Villa after Martin O&rsquo;Neill was denied immediate access  to transfer  money was followed by the player swiftly resolving his  future. McGeady  was highly impressed by the set-up at Spartak and buoyed  by coach  Valery Karpin&rsquo;s plans for him after a visit to Moscow.<br><br> What   seemed an unlikely option just over a week ago, suddenly became the   preferred route within a matter of days. The financial rewards of his   contract are obviously substantial but McGeady is already a wealthy   young man and this is a career move rather than a commercial decision.<br><br>  McGeady  was impressed by the opportunity to play in a bigger league  and for a  side involved in the group stages of the Champions League.  The Irish  internationalist is committed to becoming a better player and  has  ambitions to play at an even higher level. Neil Lennon alluded to  this  trait on Sunday when he praised McGeady&rsquo;s continuing efforts to  improve  physically and technically.<br><br> The  24-year-old player has  a future beyond Moscow but is determined to make  sure it is brighter  for his experience in a city now under the cloak of a  suffocating fog.      		<div class="big-quote">   <blockquote><br>     </blockquote>   </div>              As the deal to Villa was  crumbling, McGeady assessed his  options. And moved. It is a  characteristic that has marked his career.  Even as a child, McGeady knew  both his worth and his preferred  destination.<br> After  his first coaching session as an eight-year-old  at Busby, it was  apparent he had the talent. Liam Brady, the head of  youth development at  Arsenal, also knew where he would be playing his  football. &ldquo;He was down  here with us but we always accepted it was going  to be Celtic for him,&rdquo;  said Brady, who has worked with the winger in  the Republic of Ireland  set-up.<br><br> McGeady&rsquo;s next decision was the   one that has reverberated down the years.  He chose to play for the   Republic of Ireland as a young teenager after forming a close bond with   his grandparents in Gweedore, Donegal. Advised that he would face   criticism, even abuse, for picking the Republic, the young McGeady   insisted he would cope with it. He has.<br><br> In  an interview with  The Herald, he admitted he had been shocked by the  scale of the  invective at some grounds but quietly added that he had no  regrets.<br><br>  This strength of mind has  caused him problems. McGeady, famously, as a  youngster badgered his  mentor Tommy Burns about the lack of first-team  opportunities and later  had confrontations with Gordon Strachan and  Neil Lennon.  The  McGeady/Lennon fracas was merely the result of two  &ldquo;winners&rdquo; locking  horns. There was a darker element in his dealings  with Strachan, with  the player feeling singled out for criticism. <br><br>  This  culminated in a confrontation in December 2008 that left McGeady   devastated. He believed his Celtic career was over after a shouting   match in the dressing-room. Again, the player made an important   decision. He paid a substantial fine, trained quietly but effectively   and returned as Celtic&rsquo;s most influential player.<br> The  decision to  leave Celtic was not taken without substantial reflection.  He always  envisaged a career beyond Celtic Park and in the past had  talked about  both La Liga and the English Premier League as potential  workplaces.<br><br>  This view testified to his  ambition and to his disaffection with the  increasingly hostile  atmosphere surrounding him.  The abuse had become  extremely tedious and  so had some of the criticisms. The &ldquo;no end  product&rdquo; nonsense did not  evaporate on contact with reality.<br><br>  Last  season, for example, McGeady was joint first in the creation of  goals in  the SPL with 14 assists. Steven Davis of Rangers who spent  most of the  season playing wide with the champions, also created 14.  McGeady scored  seven goals to three by the Northern Irishman. Indeed,  as far back as  2007, McGeady was the most prolific creator of chances  in the league  with 16. He was not a regular taker of set-pieces so  statistics show he  was the best at creating goals from open play.<br><br>  These  figures also suggest that McGeady&rsquo;s decision-making on the field  was  not as poor as his detractors would insist. The &pound;10m paid by  Spartak  Moscow and O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s pursuit of the player would also lend  weight to the  theory that this is a player whose choices on the field  were regularly  impressive.<br><br> His decisions off it have been brave and sure. The advance on Moscow is his boldest yet.<br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>Aiden McGeady explains how leaving Glasgow is the most eloquent answer to his detractors</h3><br>Aiden McGeady is determined to continue his development in Moscow<br>Hugh MacDonald<br>The Herald<br>link:   http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/celtic/exclusive-aiden-mcgeady-explains-how-leaving-glasgow-is-the-most-eloquent-answer-to-his-detractors-1.1048663<br><br>Share   0 comments 16 Aug 2010<br><br>THE smog cloaking Moscow could not obscure Aiden McGeady&rsquo;s vision of the future.<br><br>Being   shuttled around a city wreathed in the smoke from spectacular forest   fires, the 24-year-old was quickly coming to a decision. Or, rather, two   decisions.<br><br>He wanted to be in Moscow and he wanted to be out of Glasgow. The move from Celtic to Spartak Moscow was thus inevitable.<br><br>McGeady   is aware that his &pound;10m transfer caused surprise, even shock in some   quarters. The player had been linked with Barclays Premier League clubs,   with Aston Villa leading the chase. Surely, the winger would be  joining  up with Martin O&rsquo;Neill? But that move foundered as the squalls  at Villa  Park gathered to produce the perfect storm that led O&rsquo;Neill to  walk  away from the club.<br><br>In contrast, McGeady took a voyage of   discovery. He flew to Moscow, talked to Spartak officials and seized  the  chance to accept another challenge.<br><br>If I feel it is the  right  thing to do, then I will do it. It is that simple. And I will  live with  the consequences Aiden McGeady <br>He will, of course, be  handsomely  compensated for his career move. Estimates of his wage range  from  &pound;40,000 to &pound;60,000 a week. McGeady will not discuss financial  terms, but  as a wealthy young man his protestations that money was not  the  deciding factor carry some weight.<br><br>&ldquo;What they were offering,  not  in terms of money but on the football side, was far greater than  any  other team who came in for me,&rdquo; he said of Spartak. &ldquo;The lure of  the  Champions League was huge. And this is a better league, too. I also  know  that people get transfers from the Russian league to Serie A, to  the  Premiership, to La Liga. Frankly, it was best for everyone if I  moved  on.&rdquo;<br><br>His first experience of the city sealed the move. As   pedestrians coughed and spluttered under the fumes from fires, McGeady   sat and quietly assessed what lay before him.<br><br>&ldquo;It was hectic,   very cosmopolitan. I liked it immediately. I was trying to get my head   round the idea that I would be here permanently. I wanted to see if I   could see myself living there, and I could.&rdquo;<br><br>His mind was almost   made up before he stepped on the plane to leave Glasgow. McGeady was   becoming restless, tired of living in a city where he could rarely feel   at ease and increasingly appalled at the level of abuse directed at  him.<br><br>&ldquo;I was getting fed up with Glasgow. I wanted to leave. Nothing against Celtic &ndash; it&rsquo;s Glasgow,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;If   you are not a footballer, it is a great city to live in. There are   loads of things to do and the people are very friendly but as a   footballer it can be a nightmare. When you are out everybody either   wants to shake your hand and praise you or they want to have a go at   you. If you have a bad result, then even going to the shops is   difficult.<br><br>&ldquo;You are hiding your face as you go past a group of   people because they will shout at you. Moscow is bigger and maybe I can   disappear into it a wee bit.&rdquo;<br><br>McGeady&rsquo;s decision to play for the   Republic of Ireland made him a target for a heightened level of abuse   from the stands. &ldquo;There are a lot of horrible places in Scotland for   that type of thing: Tynecastle, Ibrox obviously is always going to be   bad with the Celtic-Rangers rivalry, Motherwell, Falkirk. Some fans   there hate everything Celtic stand for and everything I stand for as an   Irish Catholic playing for Celtic.&rdquo;<br><br>There is a defiance,  however,  to McGeady. &ldquo;You enjoy going to those places because it makes  it even  better when you win,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>He was always aware that  to play  for the Republic was to place himself squarely in front of  ferocious  criticism. He was warned when he made the decision as a  teenager that  the reaction would not be pleasant, but McGeady was  surprised at the  vehemence of what followed.<br><br>&ldquo;It begins in the  warm-ups before  games with all sorts of stuff being shouted at you,  even from little  kids,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fair enough, you can have a shout at  somebody. Every  footballer expects that, but some of the stuff &hellip; you  would not get away  with it in any other walk of life but because you  are a footballer you  are expected to tolerate it. But if it happened in  public, on a street,  then nobody would be surprised if it developed  into a fight. It is  unbelievable what some people shout.&rdquo;<br><br>He has  never regretted his  decision to choose to play for Ireland. &ldquo;When I  made my debut for Celtic  there was a huge fuss made about it. Now I am  fed up talking about it.&rdquo;<br><br>McGeady  is, though, content about how  his life has developed. &ldquo;I am not afraid  to make decisions. If I feel  it is the right thing to do, then I will do  it. It is that simple. And I  will live with the consequences. I have  lived with the Ireland thing  for years. But I am happy with what I  decided. Yes, it turned people  against me. But I am not there to be  anybody&rsquo;s mate.&rdquo;<br><br>He deals  with criticism boldly and without any  attempt at false modesty. &ldquo;I know  what level of footballer I am. I know I  can be better but some of the  stuff levelled at me was just nonsense.&rdquo;<br><br>McGeady  addresses the  two major criticisms he has faced as a Celtic player. The  first is his  goalscoring, though his record of one goal every five  games is not too  shabby. &ldquo;I want to score more,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I remember  when I was younger  and was in the youth team I used to score a lot of  goals. I was a  great finisher. I made my debut playing as a second  striker but as I  have played more and more out wide I have seemed to  lost that part of  my game, that ability to slot in the chances. I have  lost that instinct  to score. I want that back.&rdquo;<br><br>The second criticism concerns the &ldquo;no end product&rdquo; mantra that has been a constant refrain by McGeady&rsquo;s critics.<br><br>&ldquo;How   many times have I heard that from people saying that my end product is   not good enough? Everybody can improve and I will try to do so, but  what  other winger sets up 14 goals in a season and does not take  corners or  free-kicks?<br><br>&ldquo;It is funny how people ignore statistics  when they  do not suit them. Pundits say it all the time and viewers  and readers  have it driven into them so they start to believe it. To be  honest, it  does my head in a wee bit and I will be glad to get away  from that.&rdquo;<br><br>The  overwhelming impression is of a young man ready  to move on. &ldquo;It is a  life experience. It is one of those things I will  enjoy,&rdquo; he said of  life in Moscow. &ldquo;If I was not a footballer, I would  like to go  travelling.&rdquo;<br><br>He added: &ldquo;I hear people saying it is a  bad move.  Can anybody explain that to me? What if I stayed at Celtic  and they were  struggling and I am off form or am injured? I would be  regretting the  chance not to go. I don&rsquo;t see in any way that it can be a  bad move.&rdquo;<br><br>McGeady, though, knows it will be a wrench leaving a club he loves and a family that is close.<br><br>&ldquo;Of   course, there will be will be difficulties at first. I expect that. I   can see why a lot of people would say no to Spartak because it is a   tough move to make. I accept that but I am determined to get through it.   I like the city already and it is a better level of football with the   Champions League in the offing.&rdquo;<br><br>He will, of course, be back in   Glasgow regularly, perhaps on football business. The Champions League   draw could bring him back to the city to face Rangers. He chuckles at   the prospect.<br><br>McGeady could also return later in his career to   the club that nurtured him. &ldquo;I will definitely miss Celtic Park,&rdquo; he   said. &ldquo;It is a great place to play football. It was an exhilarating   arena especially when you were playing well. The noise level was   incredible on Champions League nights or Old Firm matches. It was   tremendous to hear the roar if you got past the full-back.<br><br>&ldquo;So   every footballer would want to play there. Never say never. I am a   Celtic fan so anything is possible. Celtic would be a good place to come   back to play the last years of my career if they wanted me and I could   still perform at that level.&rdquo;<br><br>That is in the distant future.   McGeady remains focused on his challenge in Moscow. &ldquo;I am just desperate   to play,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have only been on the park for 55 minutes this   season. I want to go and win trophies for my new club. We are capable of   doing well in the league and the Champions League is a fantastic   prospect.&rdquo;<br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%">  <b><u><br></u></b></td></tr></tbody> </table><h3>Aiden McGeady lifts lid on bust-up with Gordon Strachan</h3><h3> </h3> Hugh MacDonald of The Herald<br>18 Aug 2010 	     <div class="article-body">               <font size="3">THE education of man and Bhoy can be a painful experience but it can also be inspirational, life-affirming.</font><font size="3"><br></font> 	  	                	                <font size="3">AidenMcGeady has been atthe centre of the storm. Hehas weathered it.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">The  24-year-old winger has been involved in two notorious altercations: one  with Gordon Strachan, his manager, and the other when Artur Boruc, his  team-mate, punched him after a training session. He brushes off the  latter as a piece of casual violence with no lastingrelevance.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">The Strachan episode, though, was devastating, but McGeady believes it provided him with an inner strength.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">The  events of December 13, 2008, were spectacular. McGeady trudged into the  dressing room after a disappointing 1-1 draw with Hearts to face a  manager who launched a verbal volleyathim.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">The  Celtic dressing-room erupted in noise as the player hit back. A row  that had been simmering since Strachan had joined the club had reached  boiling point. <br></font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">McGeady feared he had  played his last game for the club. &ldquo;I thought that was it. I thought it  was over,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My first reaction when I got home was that Iwould  have to move on. It was the culmination of many incidents,&rdquo; he said.</font><font size="3"><br></font>     		             <font size="3">However, the incident had  a beneficial legacy for the player. &ldquo;Frankly, it made me a stronger  person. It was a difficult experience, but I look back on it with the  feeling that I grew through it.</font><font size="3"> There were a lot of other players who  might not have come through what I came through under Strachan. A lot of  things happened that were extremely unfair.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">McGeady  feels he was singled out for criticism by the then Celtic manager.  &ldquo;Imay save all those bad times for a book in the future,&rdquo; he says,  laughing.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">He is unwilling to elaborate  but is expansive on how he came back to play for Celtic and improve as a  player. &ldquo;It toughened me,&rdquo; said McGeady. &ldquo;I felt every game I was going  into I had to play at my best because one bad game and I was pretty  much out of the team.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">&ldquo;That spurred me  on. There was an amazing feeling when you thought you had played well.  It was not one of joy, but of relief. The tension just slipped off you. I  felt so much better after the match. I felt Ihad guaranteed my place  fornext week.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">McGeady paid a fine of  two weeks&rsquo; wages &ndash; thought to be in excess of &pound;40,000 &ndash; and served a  suspension for the row with Strachan. He decided to take his punishment.  He believed his strength then lay in tackling work with a  quietprofessionalism.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">&ldquo;When I came back  to Lennoxtown after my suspension I was surprised to be back training  with the first team. To be fair, Strachan was better with me and came up  one day and said simply he was going to start me. And then I played for  the rest of the season.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">The season  ended with Strachan leaving the club after the title was lost to  Rangers. McGeady stayed when everyone predicted he would leave. <br></font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">However,  he was in no hurry to leave the club he supports because he believed he  still had work to do. His faith in the reward offered by hard labour  was fostered by his inspirational taskmaster, Tommy Burns.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">McGeady  won three league titles, two Scottish Cups and, two league cups at  Celtic. He was outstanding in the 2008/2009 Co-operative Insurance Cup  final, winning the man of the match award and scoring from the penalty  spot to seal a 2-0 victory in extra-time.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">But  one memory means the most to him. &ldquo;It has to be winning the league on  the last day in 2008,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It does not come any better than that.  You work all season and it all comes right on the final match at  Tannadice.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">It was made especially poignant because Burns, Celtic manager, coach, player and legend, had just died.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">&ldquo;He  was a great mentor. Ihave spoken about him loads of times, not just  since he passed away,&rdquo; said McGeady. &ldquo;The reason for that is how he  helped me as a man and as a coach. He would work me every single day,  spurring me on to become a better player.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">McGeady  laughs as he recalls some of the training sessions he endured as Burns,  almost manic in his enthusiasm, would push him on. &ldquo;Sometimes it got  beyond a joke,&rdquo; said McGeady, the affection unmistakeable in his voice.  &ldquo;He used to say: &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s stay out and you can hit 15 crosses in&rsquo;. We  would do that and then he would say: &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s hit another 15 &hellip; another 15 &hellip;  another.&rsquo; BeforeI knew it I had hit about 100crosses.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">His  verdict on Burns is simple but heartfelt. &ldquo;He had that love of football  that rubbed off on me and the other boys. Everything he said made  sense. He advocated continual practice. He said that if you worked and  worked and worked to make every part of your game better by just half a  per cent then it would all add up to a significant improvement.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">Asked  if he thought of Burns as the move to Spartak Moscow became  increasingly attractive, McGeady answered. &ldquo;Yes. I was sure Moscow was  the right choice but part of that is because of what Ilearned from  Tommy Burns. <br></font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">&ldquo;He was a football man and  I know he would believe this was the right move for me. This is a great  opportunity because of solid football reasons. Everybody who knows  anything about the game will see why I have gone. This is a massive club  with great ambitions.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">McGeady was  encouraged on his trip to Moscow by the enthusiasm shown to him by  Dimitri Popov, Spartak sporting director, and Valery Karpin, the  manager. <br></font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">The player is a football  obsessive. He retains memories of matches and opponents. Lasting  impressions were made when Celtic won a Champions League qualifier in a  penalty shoot-out at Parkhead in 2008.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">&ldquo;I  remember that game very well,&rdquo; said McGeady. &ldquo;We all came back into the  dressing-room raving about how good a technical team Spartak were. They  had excellent players all over the pitch and moved the ball quickly and  accurately.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">He added: &ldquo;That is the  sort of team I want to play in. I am not saying anything against Celtic  because we had different attributes, but Ibelieve Spartak will suit me  as a player.&rdquo;</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">Popov and Karpin  encouraged the player immediately. &ldquo;I asked them straight away what they  expected of me,&rdquo; says McGeady, remembering his visit to Moscow earlier  this month. &ldquo;They just said they wanted what I had been doing for the  past couple of years. They said: &lsquo;We have been after you for years&rsquo;.&rdquo;</font> <font size="3">McGeady will play on the left or right of a midfield three, bolstered by two holding midfielders.</font><font size="3"><br></font> <font size="3">&ldquo;I  was really impressed about what the management knew about me,&rdquo; he says.  &ldquo;That really sealed the deal.

He admits that, initially, football seemed less appealing  than his Sega Mega Drive, the sort of story that makes youth coaches  groan and pine for the good old days when kids ... kicked a ball about  in the street. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t actually interested in football, I wasn&rsquo;t at  all. Then, when I was eight or nine, my friend was going to train with a  football team and asked me if I wanted to go. I went along and as soon  as I started kicking the ball I liked it, but it was definitely a late  start.&rdquo; <br><br> His father John, a former professional with Sheffield United whose  career was curtailed by a cracked kneecap, was ambivalent to his son&rsquo;s  ambivalence to football. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t put any pressure on him,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I  wanted Aiden to have a profession because of what happened to my  career. It was really bizarre the way it first happened. My two brothers  have both got sons that are football mad, Aiden&rsquo;s younger than both of  them and we used to go down to Cathkin for a kickaround. I said to my  brother, Pat, that I&rsquo;d take Aiden along to see if he was going to be  interested in even kicking the thing. I bought him a wee pair of  Maradona football boots and he went up to my brother with the ball at  his feet. My brother is six foot and Aiden started moving about in front  of him. I said, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s he trying to do, Pat?&rsquo; and Pat said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s  trying to beat me&rsquo;. I don&rsquo;t think he even knew what he had to do, it was  just instinct.&rdquo; <br><br> Soon the late starter was making up for lost time. It quickly became  apparent in games for Our Lady of the Missions primary school on  Saturdays and Busby boys club on Sundays that a latent talent had been  tapped. No ball was safe. Having mastered a football, McGeady was soon  keeping up a tennis ball 500 times and a golf ball 200 times, after  watching a video of his hero, Diego Maradona, doing so. At his father&rsquo;s  insistence, each juggling exercise involved both feet. <br><br> &ldquo;Maybe because I had played the game myself, I realised that Aiden  had a gift and that the only way it was going to come to fruition was  through proper guidance. I sat down one night with Elaine, my wife, and  said, &lsquo;Apart from anything else, I have got a major responsibility  here&rsquo;. There was never any danger of me living my life through him  because he had far more natural ability than me.&rdquo; <br><br>    John decided to raise the bar: it was time to move Aiden from the  nice grass pitches that Busby played on where nice boys applauded each  other off at the end. &ldquo;My friend ran a team in the Gorbals and I thought  it would be a good idea for Aiden to start playing with guys who could  toughen him up, guys who were a bit streetwise.&rdquo; Mick Gillespie, who ran  Govanhill cubs, had been a schoolboy friend of John&rsquo;s and played for  Queen&rsquo;s Park. He took responsibility for the next stage of Aiden&rsquo;s  development. &ldquo;He used to make deals with Aiden before the game. He would  say for the first five minutes play two-touch football, the second five  minutes do what you like then two-touch again for five minutes. It made  him more of a team player, more aware.&rdquo; <br><br> By the time Aiden started at St Ninian&rsquo;s secondary school, others  wanted to make deals with him. Arsenal, Celtic, Manchester United,  Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester City all made overtures. At United,  McGeady stood out from the crop of boys brought from England, Scotland  and Ireland and Wales to one trial. At Arsenal, John recalls that Aiden,  who wore glasses then, looked like &ldquo;Harry Potter&rdquo; when handed a top  with sleeves that swallowed his tiny arms. However, he didn&rsquo;t look out  of place in the ensuing match against a side from Auxerre in front of  Liam Brady and Don Howe. &ldquo;At the end, Brady came over and said, &lsquo;He&rsquo;s  got all the ability in the world but he wants it too, he&rsquo;s got that  mental toughness&rsquo;,&rdquo; adds John. &ldquo;&lsquo;He got kicked a few times but he got  the guys back&rsquo;.&rdquo; <br><br> Aiden was as impressed by Arsenal as they were by him. Of all the  English clubs, they were the one who seriously threatened Celtic for his  signature as a schoolboy. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave home because my dad  told me he did it when he was 16 and was homesick, and I didn&rsquo;t want to  go down that path.&rdquo; There was another factor. George Adams, now head of  Rangers&rsquo; youth development, but then in charge of Celtic&rsquo;s schoolboy  scouting. <br><br> &ldquo;He was a genuine guy who said what he thought. He would come and  watch me play and then phone afterwards to say he was still interested.&rdquo; <br><br> COURTED by clubs but also by countries. There was an interested  spectator when McGeady played in that trial at Manchester United. Darren  Fletcher had been attracted by the hype that had accompanied McGeady  south. &ldquo;He completely ran the show and stood out a mile against all the  best young players in the country,&rdquo; says Fletcher. &ldquo;Andy Perry, the  chief scout at United, told me he was special and he wasn&rsquo;t wrong.  Afterwards, I met him and told him all about United and what it was like  to live down there. I was about 15 or 16 at the time and ready to sign,  but he was 12 or 13 and going round a few clubs.&rdquo;  Fletcher and McGeady shared another dilemma. Whether to play for  Scotland, the country of their birth, or Ireland, the country of their  heritage. Fletcher had to contend with Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane  as aggressive ambassadors for each cause but was always going to choose  Scotland despite the fact that his mother, Bridget, is from County Mayo.  McGeady slipped through Scotland&rsquo;s system because Celtic, at that time,  forbade their signings from playing schools football of any form for  Scotland but had no problem with Ireland, whose sides of the same age  were run by the FAI.  &ldquo;I come from an Irish background, I go over there for holidays [to  Gweedore in Donegal where his grandmother, Kitty, lives] but it&rsquo;s not  really anything to do with that, that&rsquo;s just the way I was brought up,&rdquo;  explains McGeady. &ldquo;When I was 15 I wanted to play for my country and  because I didn&rsquo;t play for my school, Scotland schoolboys wouldn&rsquo;t let  me. I thought, &lsquo;Fair enough, I&rsquo;ll just go back to playing normal  football with Celtic&rsquo;, but then Packie Bonner [the former Celtic and  Ireland goalkeeper] phoned and asked me to go over for training and I  thought, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the harm in that?&rsquo;. <br><br> &ldquo;It was a sort of get-together of the teams. I did quite well and got  asked back and was involved with all the teams &mdash; 15s, 16s, 17s. After  that, I knew the set-up really well and all the boys. When I broke into  the first team at Celtic there was all the drama about why I had picked  Ireland rather than Scotland, but the thing was I already knew the  set-up and wasn&rsquo;t going to change my mind.&rdquo; </div></div><h3> </h3> <br>Despite this assertion, officials at the Scottish Schools FA insist  they were innocent and that other players from club sides, who didn&rsquo;t  play for their schools, were selected for the international team at that  time. Berti Vogts later made a personal plea for a switch of allegiance  in his office at Hampden but it was too late and Brian Kerr has since  fast-tracked McGeady into Ireland&rsquo;s senior squad, giving him his full  debut against Jamaica last June. Ireland have a deeper pool of talent  than Scotland right now and are therefore more likely to be at the big  tournaments that McGeady craves, but the downside is that holding down a  place in their squad will be more difficult than if he had opted for  the country of his birth. &ldquo;I have had a few games here and there but I  would really like to break through and become a regular. First, you have  to do that at your own club. The thing everybody wants to do is play at  a World Cup against the best players in the world. I have still got  loads of time left to do that but eventually I would like to. 1994 was  the first one I watched and I remember Maradona running to the cameras  to celebrate his goal against Greece before he was banned.&rdquo; <br><br> One of his uncles went to see an 18-year-old Maradona destroy  Scotland at Hampden in 1979. Alan Hansen, who played against him that  day, jokes that he is still untying the knots from his legs, but a  reminder of this match brings a smile from McGeady for a different  reason as he sits talking at a table in the Room restaurant in the  salubrious surrounds of One Devonshire Gardens in Glasgow&rsquo;s west end.  &ldquo;My uncle was at the game with his friend and said, &lsquo;What do you think  of that boy Maradona?&rsquo; and he said, &lsquo;Nah, I don&rsquo;t rate him&rsquo;.&rdquo;  McGeady lacks the stocky explosiveness of his hero or Wayne Rooney  but he is a box of tricks, perhaps the closest thing Celtic have  unearthed to Jimmy Johnstone since &lsquo;Jinky&rsquo; tormented defenders in the  late 1960s and early 1970s. He has been used largely wide on the left  this season by O&rsquo;Neill, a position which allows him to cut inside onto  his slightly stronger right foot, as he recently did to score a  memorable goal against Dunfermline, his fifth of the season.  JOHN McGEADY&rsquo;s career at Sheffield United was starting as Johnstone&rsquo;s  was ending at the same club and both were right-wingers, although  different in style. McGeady senior&rsquo;s main asset was speed. &ldquo;I made my  debut when I was 17 in the equivalent of what is the Premiership now,  the old First Division, on Boxing Day 1975 and I played 11 first-team  games on the trot. Then we played Manchester City just after they had  won the League Cup. There were a couple of minutes to go and I was going  down the right wing at pace. I went past Willie Donachie and all my  weight was on my left foot and he came in and his studs caught my left  knee cap. It was an accident, he didn&rsquo;t mean it, but I heard a crack and  when I went for an X-ray they said my kneecap was broken. I wasn&rsquo;t  looked after properly, I think the specialist made a few bad decisions  because I broke it another three times and eventually had it removed.&rdquo;  He made it back to the first team before heading to the United States,  where the money was better than the football, then came back to briefly  play in Scotland, but his injuries had robbed him of his pace and he  worked for his father in the building trade, which he hated, before  training to become an English teacher, which he loves. <br><br>    So what does he think when he watches his son teasing experienced  defenders? Does he not worry that one day Aiden will also fail to get up  from one of their challenges? &ldquo;Not at all. I didn&rsquo;t have great balance,  but Aiden seems to. When he does get kicked, he absorbs the impact and  gets up and gets on with it. Jimmy Johnstone had that, so did Johan  Cruyff. Cruyff never had one knee injury in his whole career, just the  odd pulled muscle. Nobody got kicked more than Jimmy but he never had a  serious injury. I don&rsquo;t worry because if it&rsquo;s going to happen, it&rsquo;s  going to happen.&rdquo; <br><br> It already has to another promising young Celtic player. John Kennedy  has required a series of operations to rebuild his left knee after a  shocking challenge by Ioan Ganea of Romania when he made his Scotland  debut last March, and the defender will not return until 2006. A  reminder of how precarious football is as a profession to McGeady, if it  was necessary after his father&rsquo;s misfortune. <br><br> &ldquo;It was terrible for John, because he was playing so well at the time  and had broken into the first team, but he&rsquo;s a resilient guy. I think  he&rsquo;ll come back and do well.&rdquo; <br><br> The number of youngsters pressing for first-team places is perhaps  reminiscent of the early 1970s when a group, collectively dubbed the  Quality Street Kids and including the likes of Kenny Dalglish, Danny  McGrain, Lou Macari, George Connelly and Vic Davidson, were pressing  Jock Stein for first-team places at the expense of the Lisbon Lions. It  remains to be seen whether McGeady, Kennedy, Ross Wallace, Shaun Maloney  and David Marshall, who was taught English by John McGeady for two  years, can make such an impression on O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s established team. &ldquo;Only  time will tell really,&rdquo; replies McGeady, wisely, to this possibility.  &ldquo;We have only played a handful of games between us. It would different  if we were all in the team together and playing well.&rdquo; <br><br> He has learned to play patience. His father described him to me as  &ldquo;petulant&rdquo; in his first year as a professional at Celtic when we spoke a  year ago, and McGeady now accepts that he expected too much, too young.  &ldquo;I was 16 and saying to myself, &lsquo;I am going to play in the first team  this season&rsquo;, but I wasn&rsquo;t ready. If you think I am small now, I was a  lot smaller then. I think I was just kidding myself on. Ross [Wallace]  played in a testimonial when he was quite young and I just wanted to do  the same. Tommy Burns [Celtic&rsquo;s director of youth development] always  says it&rsquo;s not about when you make your debut, it&rsquo;s if you stay there.  I&rsquo;ve sort of needed a clip round the ear every so often and I&rsquo;ve had it  off them. The coaching set-up is good at Celtic and I think there&rsquo;s  going to be a few more coming through.&rdquo; <br><br> When McGeady was initially called into first-team training, he hardly  distinguished himself. &ldquo;I had an absolute beast because I was just so  nervous. The ball was coming to me and going under my foot and everyone  was shouting at me.&rdquo; <br><br> He is aware that a player with his trickery &mdash; his favourite is an  improvised version of the Cruyff turn &mdash; can easily earn a reputation as a  show-off. &ldquo;If I am keeping the ball up that&rsquo;s just to improve my  control, I would never do anything like that in a game. Sometimes  Ronaldinho is described as doing too many tricks but as long as there is  an end product then nobody can really complain. Earlier in the season, I  would get to the byline and my crosses wouldn&rsquo;t be as good as I thought  they should. Lately, since I have come back into the team, I have been  setting up more goals from those positions which is pleasing because  that&rsquo;s really your job when you are playing left or right midfield.&rdquo; <br><br> It is easy to forget that it is only a year to the week since he made  his debut for Celtic, in which he scored against Hearts at Tynecastle.  Already, he has seen off Juninho, who failed to consistently provide the  extra flair O&rsquo;Neill was looking for and has gone back to Brazil. Then,  just when it seemed McGeady might have tied down one of those precious  first-team places, Craig Bellamy arrived on loan from Newcastle to  provide another alternative of speed and movement to Celtic&rsquo;s manager.  He has had to be content with a place on the bench for the last two Old  Firm games, despite good form in the run-up to them, but appreciated  O&rsquo;Neill taking the time to explain his omission to accommodate Bellamy. <br><br>His  most striking performance so far was against AC Milan in the Champions  League, at Parkhead in December, when he terrorised Fabricio Coloccini,  the Italians&rsquo; makeshift right-back, and left a lasting impression on  Paolo Maldini. &ldquo;He has talent, a good personality and calmness,&rdquo; said  the great man afterwards. &ldquo;Celtic lack a player who can beat people, who  can do something different to alter the course of a game and perhaps he  can become it.&rdquo; McGeady glows when this compliment is relayed to him,  the mask he keeps on his emotions slipping for perhaps the only time in  an hour or so of chat. &ldquo;The AC Milan game was the first Champions League  game I played in where I realised I could maybe cut it at this level.  It&rsquo;s unbelievable to get a compliment from a player like Maldini. He&rsquo;s  been playing at the highest level for near enough 20 years.&rdquo; <br><br>Indeed,  he is old enough to be McGeady&rsquo;s dad. That may have been the night when  the boy wonder became a man, although he should still be permitted a  few trips back to his childhood with a ball when the mood takes him. <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%">  <b><u><br></u></b></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3><span class="diffAdd">What has happened to Aiden McGeady?

Folk would come to watch him play just to see how easy he found dribbling past much older boys who had no clue how to stop him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> McGeady would later estimate he went on trial 13 different times at Arsenal. Sir Alex Ferguson apparently took to phoning his house. But to McDowall&rsquo;s great joy the little skinny kid who seemed born with a ball at his feet chose Celtic, which just so happened to be the team he supported.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> &ldquo;You only discover one Aiden McGeady in a generation,&rdquo; said McDowall as his prot&eacute;g&eacute; was establishing himself as the most exciting prospect at Celtic for longer than anyone cared to remember.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> And yet this was Roy Keane about the same player just this week.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> &ldquo;My reaction to Aiden&rsquo;s performance? He can do a lot better but maybe that&rsquo;s the story of Aiden&rsquo;s career.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Ouch.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> That McGeady came into Keane&rsquo;s firing line &ndash; after the Irish lost to Belarus - would have come as little surprise to anyone in Ireland. They have watched this player win 82 caps over 12 years and yet still cannot make up their mind about him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Actually, that&rsquo;s not quite true. Some have no doubts; most notably former player turned pundit Eamon Dumphy who just can&rsquo;t see why there is any fuss over a winger who doesn&rsquo;t score goals, provide any assists and finds it difficult to beat a man, which is supposed to be his forte.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> McDowall predicted that McGeady at 30 would be on track to win 100 caps, who by the age of 24 would win every domestic trophy in Scotland, and then go onto make a fortune from a &pound;12m move to Spartak Moscow and have a highlights package which makes him look like a word beater.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> But what must he, and the many McGeady admirers, think of him now?</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> He flopped at Everton, was deemed not good enough to even be part of the Sheffield Wednesday squad for the Championship play-off last weekend and, when not being criticised by Keane, is currently looking for a new club.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> So many questions.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Did his talent justify the hype? Was he ever really that good in the first place? Has he wasted his career? The answers are yes (mostly), yes (absolutely) and no (not really)</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> But McGeady has not become the player he could have been - it&#39;s time to take when you can&#39;t get a game for Sheffield Wednesday - and his best years really do seem to have come at Celtic, the club he left for Russia in 2010. Although this is hardly a tale of failure.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Since then he has made a right few bob from his tax-free years in Moscow. He owns property</span><span class="diffFormatting" title=""> </span><span class="diffAdd">including shares in at least one restaurant in his home city. But he did okay in Russia, no more than that, and then Everton was supposed to be the perfect club for him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> McGeady was 28 when he moved to Goodison and a goal on the first day of the 2014/15 season, a lovely curled finish after a typical dribble, was really the one and only highlight.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> McGeady still made Martin O&rsquo;Neill squad for the European finals in France but there are many of the green army who have had enough of him. His last start came over a year ago. He is very lucky to have made the cut.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Against Belarus, after a bright start, he began to lose possession and misplace passes. This did not go unnoticed by the crowd. There were even a few boos directed at him. Some might even suggest this, as Keane said, sums up the career of Aiden McGeady. Good at the beginning and then it all goes a bit meh.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> &ldquo;I just think he&rsquo;s got amazing talent, I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gone on with Sheffield Wednesday this year, for me he should have been lighting up the Championship,&rdquo; said former Ireland winger Damien Duff when speaking to the Irish Examiner.</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it is injury problems, or he didn&rsquo;t fit with the manager or what, but I&rsquo;d love to see him go to France and do well, his ability is a dying breed. I love him to bits. Even in training every day, I thought I could dribble until I saw this kid, he&rsquo;s just on another planet.&rdquo;</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Article continues after...</span><br><span class="diffAdd">  </span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers wants to pack out the stadium</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Brendan Rodgers gets to work at Lennoxtown</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Rangers legend John Brown promotes the season ticket renewal deadline and predicts a good season for his old club</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> John Brown: Rangers are years away from the...</span><br><span class="diffAdd"> Karim Benzema poses with the Champions League Trophy after the final match between Real Madrid and Club Atletico de Madrid at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza.
