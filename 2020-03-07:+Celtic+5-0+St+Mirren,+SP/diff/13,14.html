Picture: Ross Parker/ SNS<br>Leigh Griffiths scores his hat-trick goal against St Mirren. Picture: Ross Parker/ SNS Copyright: 2020 SNS Group<br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/celtic/celtic-5-0-st-mirren-leigh-griffiths-hits-hat-trick-and-announces-i-was-born-ibrox-2440723<br>A first hat-trick in four years for Leigh Griffiths provided another indication the Celtic striker is making a real fist at rediscovering his irrepressible best following his mental health and fitness issues of 2019. Yet the 29-year-old didn&rsquo;t restrict such indicators to the 5-0 whipping of St Mirren that pushed the gap over Rangers, with two games in hand, to 16 points.<br><br>There was the impishness of old in how he dealt with his post-match media duties, especially when the subject turned to the club&rsquo;s ancient adversaries and a trip to Ibrox next up for Neil Lennon&rsquo;s men. It&rsquo;s not simply that Griffiths is itching to play in that derby after a restorative two months when he has plundered goals &ndash; eight in all &ndash; and partnered Odsonne Edouard in Celtic&rsquo;s revitalising 3-2 team reshaping. He presented it as some sort of destiny.<br><br>&ldquo;I was born for Ibrox,&rdquo; Griffiths said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been beaten there with Celtic. I have started there twice and scored twice with two victories. If the manager [right]starts me, or has me on the bench to go on and make an impact, I&rsquo;ll be ready to go.<br>Celtic: Get the latest team news, match previews and reports<br><br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m desperate to play in a game of that magnitude but what the starting 11 is, that&rsquo;s up to the manager and the coaching staff. There will probably be another ten players itching to be on the bench so he&rsquo;s got a difficult job.&rdquo;<br><br>The forward says there is more to come from him &ldquo;all day long&rdquo; after his contribution at a canter against a St Mirren side devoid of the obduracy of their last visit &ndash; which manager Jim Goodwin confessed was not unrelated to picking a team with an eye on the critical relegation tussle with Hearts on Wednesday.<br><br>The interplay between Edouard &ndash; who netted his 28th of the season when he spun 180 degrees at the edge of the area before planting in the corner for the fourth early in the second period &ndash; and Griffiths would likely have done for the Paisley team whatever line-up they fielded.<br><br>The visitors were unfortunate that, for the first of what proved his fifth triple for Celtic, Griffiths appeared offside after ghosting in behind the St Mirren backline to tuck away a flighted-in ball from his French strike partner. An opener fashioned after only 18 minutes, Griffiths then created and finished a classy second on the stroke of half-time &ndash; his &ldquo;favourite&rdquo; of an afternoon that earned him a first hat-trick since he netted three times in an 8-1 win over Hamilton Accies in January 2016.<br><br>&ldquo;I wanted to get the ball out of my feet and shoot, but the defender got back too quickly. I then managed to work a wee one-two with Tom [Rogic] and just clip the ball over the keeper which was a nice finish.&rdquo;<br><br>Griffiths was matter of fact about his 74th minute third &ndash; &ldquo; was just what I normally do, get it out my feet and hit the target&rdquo; &ndash; but when he opened his body, and lazered the ball into the corner from 20 yards, it was so vintage him, that it said everything about his recovery to a status that so many thought was permanently beyond him.<br><br>The further sheen for Celtic came with a fifth goal in stoppage time, an 89th league goal in a league campaign in which they have harvested 61 points from a possible 66: the result of Sam Foley&rsquo;s penalty-box trip on substitute Hatem Abd Elhamed that allowed Callum McGregor his 13th goal of the season, from the spot.<br><br>Goodwin was philosophical about his team&rsquo;s heaviest defeat of the season on an afternoon he elected to leave key performer Ilkay Durmus on the bench. &ldquo;There was an element of picking a team today with a view to Wednesday night,&rdquo; the St Mirren manager said. &ldquo;We set up in a manner to give us the best chance of picking up something from the game. But I&rsquo;d be lying if I said Wednesday night wasn&rsquo;t more important.<br><br>&ldquo;We go into every game trying to win it but we knew how difficult it would be here. Celtic have played 16 games here in the league and won 15, with Rangers the only team to beat them. They put four, five, six or seven past teams all the time at Parkhead and we&rsquo;re on the receiving end of a sore one this afternoon. But these games against the Old Firm won&rsquo;t define our season.&rdquo;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><div>  BBC<br>Leigh Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Celtic extended their lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership to 16 points after easing aside St Mirren.<br><br>Griffiths scored twice in the first-half - from Odsonne Edouard&#39;s cross, then after a one-two with Tom Rogic. Edouard netted before Griffiths&#39; third while Callum McGregor converted a late penalty as Celtic edged closer to a ninth consecutive title.<br><br>Neil Lennon&#39;s side - who have played two more games than Rangers - have won 12 of their 13 domestic games in 2020.<br><br>St Mirren, meanwhile, slip to 11th and are now just three points clear of bottom side Hearts.<br><br> Reaction &amp; as it happened<br><br>No complacency, no surprises<br><br>Any chance of a shock St Mirren victory looked slim. It is 30 years since the Paisley side had last won in the east end of Glasgow - a young Paul Lambert putting the final goal past Pat Bonner in a 3-0 win.<br><br>In the here and now, Celtic were aiming to go 16 points clear at the top for 24 hours at least, with St Mirren looking for anything to ease their relegation fears.<br><br>Although history hung heavy against the visitors, Jim Goodwin&#39;s side began the match well as they sported a sturdy back three with the wing-backs getting St Mirren up the field.<br><br>But one of those wing-backs - Calum Waters - switched off for a second and allowed Griffiths to ghost in at the back post to finish calmly from close range to make it 1-0.<br><br>That dented the confidence of the away side as Celtic began to pepper the St Mirren goal, Vaclav Hladky having to pull off a series of fine saves to keep out Edouard, James Forrest and Rogic.<br><br>Tony Andreu managed a swerving shot from 20 yards which Fraser Forster comfortably saved, but any chance of a St Mirren revival evaporated on the stroke of half time.<br><br>A wonderful moment of interplay on the edge of the box between Rogic and Griffiths put the Scotland striker in and he dinked the ball past Hladky to make it 2-0.<br>Odsonne Edouard<br><br>Getting anything from this match would have been a bonus for St Mirren, their impending midweek encounter against Hearts of greater import in terms of how this season pans out.<br><br>As for Celtic, this was all about ensuring no complacency crept in with such a massive gap over Rangers at the top of the table and a meeting with their city rivals at Ibrox next weekend.<br><br>Griffiths rifled in another shot which Hladky touched wide, but it felt almost inevitable Celtic would score again.<br><br>Edouard&#39;s footwork had been impressive all afternoon, and he turned neatly in the box before firing home with ruthless efficiency as the game ceased to be any kind of contest.<br><br>There was icing on the cake for Celtic and Scotland as Griffiths lashed home from the edge of the box to seal a fine hat-trick - taking his tally for the season to 11.<br><br>McGregor fired home a late penalty as Celtic ran out very comfortable winners.<br>Man of the match - Leigh Griffiths<br><br>Griffiths could not be coming to the boil at a better time, with Celtic closing in on a ninth title in a row, a showdown with Rangers next weekend, and massive matches for Scotland now only weeks away.<br><br>He looks sharp and hungry again, and that wand of a left foot will always be with him. The best compliment you can pay him is that he is now starting to look like the Griffiths of old.<br>&#39;I&#39;m pleased for Leigh&#39; - reaction<br>Five-goal win is &#39;fantastic&#39; for Celtic - Lennon<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon: &quot;Leigh&#39;s been working hard since the beginning of the year. I&#39;m just pleased for him personally.<br><br>&quot;And I&#39;m delighted for Tom Rogic. We&#39;ve been rotating him and Ryan Christie and he shows great intelligence and great feet.&quot;<br><br>St Mirren manager Jim Goodwin: &quot;We didn&#39;t really get close enough to Celtic, we didn&#39;t show enough aggression all over the park.<br><br>&quot;Celtic are miles ahead of anyone in this league. It&#39;s quite scary really, they probably never got out of second gear this afternoon and still managed to put five past us so we&#39;ve just got to take it on the chin.&quot;<br><br><br>Celtic: Leigh Griffiths hat-trick sends message to Steve Clarke - Neil Lennon<br><br> From the section Celtic <br><br>Leigh Griffiths scores Celtic&#39;s fourth goal in the 5-0 win over St Mirren<br>Leigh Griffiths scored a hat-trick as Celtic beat St Mirren 5-0<br><br>Leigh Griffiths has sent a message to Scotland manager Steve Clarke with his first hat-trick in four years, says Celtic manager Neil Lennon.<br><br>Celtic thrashed St Mirren 5-0 on Saturday, with Griffiths taking his goals tally for the season to 11.<br><br>The 29-year-old striker missed a large part of the season through personal problems and injury, but eight of those goals have come this year.<br><br>&quot;He has answered all his critics,&quot; Lennon said.<br><br>&quot;People were saying he is finished here and that was never the case.&quot;<br><br> Celtic 16 points clear after win over St Mirren<br> Griffiths &#39;ready to go&#39; for Scotland<br><br>Griffiths has not played for Scotland since a 2-0 win over Albania in September 2018 but is keen to get back into head coach Clarke&#39;s squad for the Euro 2020 play-off semi-final with Israel on 26 March.<br><br>&quot;It is down to Steve - he has been watching all the games I am sure,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;If he hasn&#39;t seen Leigh today, that might be a message to him from the player himself.<br><br>&quot;His timing is pretty good. If you need a goal and you have a player there, why not?<br><br>&quot;We have worked with him and were patient, so he owes the club a lot and with performances like that he is starting to pay it.&quot;<br><br>Odsonne Edouard and Callum McGregor were also on the scoresheet as Celtic created a 16-point gap at the top of the Scottish Premiership, albeit having played two games more than second-placed Rangers.<br><br>However, Griffiths stole the headlines with his first treble since an 8-1 win over Hamilton Academical in January 2016.<br><br>&quot;He is getting there, but there is more to come from him, no question of that, but definitely good signs,&quot; Lennon added.<br><br>&quot;He can get fitter, stronger, more endurance into his game.<br><br>&quot;He has come a long way and I think that hat-trick will mean a lot to him personally.
