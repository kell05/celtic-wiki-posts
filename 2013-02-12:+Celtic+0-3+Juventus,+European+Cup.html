Grand or what? He later stated he was taken out of context and kind of apologised. <br>  </li><li>  Paddy McCourt dropped from squad, only one to be so. Signs of discontent over him or vice versa? <br>  </li><li>  Efe Ambrose played in final for Nigeria in Africans Nations Cup Sunday past which they duly won. What a great season for him, and congrats and respect to him. However he ended up surprisingly starting this game after 48 hours of celebrating beforehand. He cost us two goals in this game. <br>  </li><li>  Pope Benedict resigned in an unprecedented move in the previous day due to health reasons.   </li><li>  Michael Owen (ex-England international): &quot;Gutted. Celtic deserve so much more. They have been outstanding. Particularly annoying having witnessed so many dirty tricks by the Italians.&quot;</li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Review</h3>(Arsene P of KDS forum)  <br>In the cold light of day, the game boiled down to them taking the chances presented to them on a plate, and us not creating clear cut chances.<br><br>Neither keeper had anything other than bread and butter collections to deal with (apart from the goals, obv.)<br><br>The continued man-handling stramashes at our corners were annoying, mainly because the ref made such a show of booking the two of them early doors, then bottling the subsequent re-occurrences. He also made some other baffling decisions, but I haven&#39;t seen any replays to confirm or deny my natural inclination that the ref was rubbish. Not to mention the 5th and 6th linesmen. WTF were they looking at? Pointless.<br><br>All in all, I reckon Juve stuck to their game plan and capitalised on the mistakes. whilst we played at random, it seemed. Two full backs marauding at the same time leaving the two CHs isolated was always going to put them under pressure at times.<br><br>We at least showed we can play a wee bit, but I can&#39;t help feeling we fell in to the trap Juventus set us by letting us come on to them while they were confident in their rugby abilities to defend the set pieces and not let clear cut chances be made, and just wait for a mistake to pounce on. On another day we may have scored the goal to get the place rocking, but a favourable result last night just wasn&#39;t in the stars.<br><br>If we had a wee bit more composure at times, we may have created better chances, but as it was from where I could see, we had two sitter headers and multiple long range efforts which ultimately weren&#39;t good enough to trouble Buffon.<br><br>The tie is done, and that is the only true disappointment and annoyance. <br><br>At 0-1 it was a great game. Exciting, tense and all of the things that make football the game it is. At 0-2 the heads went a wee bit, on and off the field, and when the third went in, everybody knew that it is all over.<br><br>Pirlo eventually ran the show for them, and we had decent performances from most. I&#39;m not going to analyse individuals as we all know who effed up for the goals, but given the sterling performances over the whole campaign I wouldn&#39;t say anything against any of our players for their contribution, unlike the many big game glory hunting fannies who know eff all about the game slagging off our players for the slightest mistake assuming that Juventus were on the same level as Dundee and expecting miracles.<br><br>(SaMule of KDS forum)<br>Forster - obviously a bit rusty still, could have done better at the first goal and probably the second too. Other than the three goals though I don&#39;t remember them testing him at all.<br><br>Izaguirre - excellent, best he&#39;s played in a long time. <br><br>Wilson - minor quibble about not being quick enough to react at their first goal, but other than that was great. Got us out of trouble more than a few times.<br><br>Ambrose - had one of those weird games where he was actually pretty good for 99% of the game, but his three mistakes led to two goals for them and a missed goal for us. Pretty sure Matthews was actually about to come on for him when Lustig got injured. What if?<br><br>Lustig - had a very good game, would have liked to see him take his man on a bit more often than he did but I can&#39;t really quibble with the crosses he put in instead. Him going off appeared to upset us a bit.<br><br>Mulgrew - didn&#39;t have a bad game, but didn&#39;t have a great one either. Wasn&#39;t even taking most of the set pieces which is usually the only reason I can think of for keeping him in the side.<br><br>Wanyama - wasn&#39;t going to let anyone dribble past him or get the ball of him. If he wasn&#39;t playing football he&#39;d be putting atlas stones on plinths.<br><br>Brown - still got all the energy of his younger days but has now combined that with real intelligence and an ability to pass that I never thought he&#39;d have. Great game.<br><br>Commons - was excellent in the first half, but for all the shots he had on target not one of them really tested Buffon. Needs to try looking up every now and again and thinking about where the goalkeeper is before he shoots.<br><br>Forrest - ran all night but did very little of note. The Juve defenders dealt with him easily enough.<br><br>Hooper - see Forrest. Neither of them could get anything out of what was a very well organised defence.<br><br>Subs:<br>Matthews - I know he played for over half an hour, but I genuinely don&#39;t remember him doing much, good or bad.<br>Watt - see Forrest &amp; Hooper<br>Kayal - see Matthews, just for less time. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3>  <div>  <div class="home-team">  <h3 class="team-name">  Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list">  <li>  01 Forster   </li><li>  03 Izaguirre   </li><li>  04 Ambrose   </li><li>  06 Wilson   </li><li>  21 Mulgrew   </li><li>  23 Lustig (Matthews - 58&#39;

Claudio Barzagli, Leonardo Bonucci and Martin Caceres &ndash; who added a considerable element of cynicism to their consummate mastery of space and timing.<br><br>At the other end of the field, Juve made few openings but demonstrated the art of expert exploitation with an early and crucial goal from Alessandro Matri and late strikes by Claudio Marchisio and Mirko Vucinic. In marked contrast, Neil Lennon&rsquo;s decision to field Efe Ambrose rebounded upon him.<br><br>The Nigerian had played in his country&rsquo;s triumph over Burkino Faso in the Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday but did not return to Glasgow until the day of the match.<br><br>Nevertheless, Lennon believed that the deployment of Ambrose trumped his other back line options and named him in the starting line-up.<br><br>&ldquo;We need a miracle,&rdquo; Lennon admitted afterwards. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the harsh reality of Champions League football and some of my young players will learn a huge lesson tonight.<br><br>&ldquo;I thought for 70-odd minutes, until the second goal, we were by far the better side &ndash; but you can&rsquo;t give away goals like we gave away, sloppy.<br><br>&ldquo;Efe was poor for the first goal but we had good chances to equalise. Then we switched off defensively for the second goal and the third goal was poor.&rdquo;<br><br>He added ruefully: &ldquo;We took a gamble on Efe Ambrose.&rdquo;<br><br>Within three minutes Ambrose was hauled back to earth in cruel fashion after the euphoria of Johannesburg. Only a few seconds earlier the 24-year-old had been part of the powerful opening surge which saw Celtic surf on the familiar billows of passion from the stands to force two corner kicks, the second of which saw him shoot narrowly past.<br><br>Ambrose was instantly exposed by the simplest move in the book, a punt upfield from the Juve defence which caught him in two minds and allowed Matri to fasten on to the dropping ball and slot it through Fraser Forster&rsquo;s legs. The ball crossed the line, although Kelvin Wilson scooped it out again &ndash; the match officials did not signal a goal &ndash; but the defender&rsquo;s attempted clearance was anticipated by Marchisio, who drove high into the roof of the net to guarantee that Juve&rsquo;s scoring record would, one way or the other, extend to 19 successive games.<br><br>This could have been a body blow but Celtic came off the canvas as though nothing untoward had occurred. Remarkably, the territory they found most promising was immediately behind Andrea Pirlo and in front of Gianluigi Buffon&rsquo;s penalty area. With 10 minutes played &ndash; and at an unsustainable tempo &ndash; a pattern had emerged, with Celtic pressing and shooting on sight of goal but taking risks with two on two at the back, which Juve repeatedly attempted to exploit.<br><br>By the interval another theme had surfaced as the Juve defenders realised that they were being indulged by the Spanish referee in rough treatment of Gary Hooper. After being manhandled by Buffon, the English striker gave his opponents the satisfaction of seeing him lose his temper in a clash with Stephan Lichtsteiner, both of whom were cautioned.<br><br>The second half presented Celtic with an opportunity and a difficulty. On the plus side, Juve were clearly vulnerable on their left, but James Forrest was unable to make sufficiently menacing inroads and Hooper lacked the physical presence to disrupt the back three.<br><br>The only remaining promise was now from set-piece play and, sure enough, Celtic&rsquo;s one outstanding chance came from a corner kick played short by Kris Commons to Charlie Mulgrew, who placed a typically precise cross on to the head of Ambrose. The Nigerian, though, looked bemused by his clear view of goal and merely bounced his header into the arms of Buffon.<br><br>That, however, was not the end of his miserable evening. The coup de grace was administered with seven minutes remaining when Ambrose allowed the ball to lodge between his boots and was robbed by Vucinic, who beat Forster to finish the tie before making way for Nicolas Anelka.<br><br>For the first time in six Champions League home games the Celtic crowd was silenced. Three months of euphoria, generated by their immortal group stage triumph over Barcelona, had been replaced by the imposition of another sort of reality.<br><br>Lennon and his players are entitled to reflect with satisfaction on the passage that brought them this far and their fans will pay them the tribute of following them as they observe the formality of the return leg in Turin.<br><br>The shroud, though, has already been draped over Celtic&rsquo;s participation in a tournament which yielded so much pleasure for them.<br><br>Match details<br><br>Celtic (4-4-2): Forster; Lustig (Matthews 59), Wilson, Ambrose, Izaguirre; Forrest, Brown (Kayal 80), Wanyama, Mulgrew; Commons (Watt 73), Hooper.<br>Subs: Zaluska (g), Matthews, Kayal, Ledley, Miku, Watt, Lassad.<br>Booked: Hooper, Forrest, Brown.<br>Juventus (3-5-1): Buffon; Barzagli, Bonucci, Martin Caceres; Lichtsteiner, Vidal, Pirlo, Marchisio, Peluso; Matri (Pogba 80), Vucinic.<br>Subs: Storari (g), Pogba, Giovinco, Anelka, Padoin, Quagliarella, Marrone.<br>Booked: Lichtsteiner, Padoin.<br>Referee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spain).<br><h3>  Celtic 0 Juventus 3: Agony for Celtic as Efe Ambrose gamble backfires against ruthless Turin giants</h3>13 Feb 2013 00:01  <br>Daily Record<br><br>CELTIC need a miracle in Turin after the Italians capitalised on Neil Lennon&#39;s decision to play Ambrose in their Champions League last-16 showdown.<br>Kelvin Wilson tried to keep it out Kelvin Wilson tried to keep it out<br><br>ON reflection, perhaps it would have been better to give him the night off.<br><br>Just because team-mates call Efe Ambrose Morgan Freeman, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily follow that the script is always written with him in mind.<br><br>If that were the case, Ambrose would have won the African Cup of Nations for his country on Sunday night and kept enough in the tank to race halfway across the globe and produce more heroics for his club in one of the greatest triumphs of Celtic&rsquo;s recent history.<br><br>But in reality it was all too much for the big Nigerian who left Parkhead last night a crestfallen and exhausted figure, knowing he had just been turned over by the Men in Black.<br><br>In other words, he had just walked into the wrong movie.<br><br>Not only did Ambrose start the night horribly with a defensive lapse which allowed Alessandro Matri to open the scoring and the Italians to dictate the action from then on.<br><br>But in the second half when this tie was still in the balance, he made an even bigger blunder when offered the chance of redemption at the other end. But he made a Shawshank of the header and Celtic&rsquo;s hopes escaped with it.<br><br>Not long after that the utterly faultless Claudio Marchiso fired Juventus into a two-goal lead.<br><br>And before Celtic had regrouped Mirko Vucinic completed the Italian job with a third goal after another piece of sloppy play by Ambrose.<br><br>It will take a miracle now to stop Celtic&rsquo;s adventure from ending here.<br><br>In fact, let&rsquo;s face it, the tie was over last night. There will be no way back in Turin next month because the task is now so large it&rsquo;s insurmountable.<br><br>This was hardly the way it was supposed to end. It was meant to be so much more romantic and rewarding for Neil Lennon and his players.<br><br>Hopes had been so high a few hours earlier. Lennon came bounding off the team bus, clenching a fist to the crowd as the first roar of the night went up &ndash; a noise so ferocious that it nearly startled old Brother Walfrid out of his slumber.<br><br>One by one his players followed him up the steps, carried in through the front doors on a thunderous wave of goodwill.<br><br>This was it. Two long months spent waiting for this moment were over. It was time to go to work.<br><br>Inside the ground, the corner reserved for the travelling fans was already filling up rapidly. For a while they may have been looking around, wondering what the fuss was all about. They would find out soon enough.<br><br>Gradually, the vast slopes began to awaken as Celtic&rsquo;s supporters filed into position and as they did, the night air began to crackle in that unmistakable manner.<br><br>It&rsquo;s a weird science alright but a unique chemical reaction takes place every time UEFA&rsquo;s anthem is boomed out into this already highly-charged atmosphere.<br><br>Celtic Juventus Celtic continued to battle - and had chances<br>Rob Casey/SNS Group<br><br><br>It may sound a bit of a cliche but it&rsquo;s true nonetheless. There is nowhere quite like it on nights such as these. It doesn&rsquo;t just tickle the senses, it claws at them until the body experiences a higher state of consciousness. It is the ultimate performance enhancer.<br><br>If only Peter Lawwell knew how to capture and bottle it he could have supplied Lance Armstrong and made himself a small fortune.<br><br>Trouble was last night it was not only Celtic&rsquo;s players whose eyes were bulging on the adrenalin rush. Juventus were sucking it in too and, amid the madness of it all, they got off to a flyer. Less than three minutes after the first whistle they were in the lead after a bit of jet-lagged defending from Ambrose who had only just stepped off the red eye from Lagos to make it here on time.<br><br>The Nigerian was still half dozing when Federico Peluso floated a high ball in his general direction.<br><br>Rather than step forward to deal with it, Ambrose hesitated and allowed Matri to muscle him out of the way and barge through to poke a low finish under the advancing Fraser Forster. Although Kelvin Wilson slid in to hack it out from under the bar, replays later showed the ball had already crossed the line.<br><br>In any case, Marchisio was on hand to remove all doubt by lashing it into the roof of the net by way of insurance.<br><br>The fact that Marchiso was so far forward and so alert so early in the match was a sign of Italian intent.<br><br>Celtic Juventus But Juve counter-attacked and Marchisio hit a shot<br>Alan Harvey/SNS Group<br><br><br>They were sharp and impressive in the opening exchanges, shuttling the ball at pace and looking to isolate Ambrose and Wilson with a succession of longer, higher probes.<br><br>But they had to operate at full speed because that&rsquo;s the pace Celtic were setting for them.<br><br>Even before the opener, Victor Wanyama had tested Gianluigi Buffon with a tasty drive which the keeper fumbled around his left-hand post.<br><br>Buffon would make further saves to keep out another Wanyama effort and two more from Kris Commons all inside the opening 15 minutes. Charlie Mulgrew also cracked one into the keeper&rsquo;s side netting as Celtic charged around, hunting for their opening.<br><br>And yet they knew a second goal would render them unconscious and the situation unrecoverable.<br><br>There were dangerous moments, such as when Vucinic picked out Marchiso with a cross to the back post but this time the midfield man sliced a volley over the top.<br><br>And so it continued, this constant, meaty cut and thrust. Celtic kept on peppering Buffon&rsquo;s goal but without ever making the veteran perform heroics.<br><br>When the outstanding Commons did conjure something a little out of the ordinary, an overhead kick from Mikael Lustig&rsquo;s cross, it caught Buffon flat-footed but bounced wide. This was as close as the home side would come to a first-half leveller.<br><br>But they headed inside with heads held high after as strong a 45 minutes as they had produced all season.<br><br>The real worry for Lennon at the break was that, even at their best, Celtic weren&rsquo;t really rattling the Italians or dragging them out of their comfort zone.<br><br>He might also have spent the interval wondering if the Spanish officials might be a bit more generous or even just alert in the second half. They didn&rsquo;t appear interested in clamping down on some rough tactics when Juve were defending set-plays and this had become a source of real annoyance to the home fans.<br><br>The fact that moments after the restart Lennon could be seen applauding ref Alberto Mallenco for awarding a fairly obvious foul suggested he too was nearing the end of his tether.<br><br>Celtic striker Gary Hooper (centre) receives some rough treatment from Juventus pair Gianluigi Buffon (right) and Stephan Lichtsteiner Celtic striker Gary Hooper (centre) receives some rough treatment from Juventus pair Gianluigi Buffon (right) and Stephan Lichtsteiner<br>SNS<br><br><br>Lennon did not wait long to make a change, Adam Matthews replacing the limping Lustig before the hour.<br><br>And moments later he looked on in disbelief as Ambrose blew his big chance to even things up.<br><br>The defender was lurking in the penalty box as Celtic worked a short corner. He was then picked out perfectly by Mulgrew&rsquo;s whipped delivery but although Ambrose was all alone, unmarked just six yards from goal, he managed only to fluff a header straight into Buffon&rsquo;s arms. This was such an awful waste that it was bordering on unforgivable.<br><br>And Juventus were quick to dish out the punishment. In 76 minutes, Marchiso cut inside Scott Brown, leaving Ambrose in his slipstream before crashing a shot past Foster and ripping the heart and soul out of this stadium.<br><br>Then, eight minutes from time, Marchiso plunged in one last knife. He robbed Ambrose and slipped a perfect pass through for Vucinic to slam home Juve&rsquo;s third of the night.<br><br>If helping Celtic to win this thing for a second time was on Ambrose&rsquo;s Bucket List then he&rsquo;ll just have to try again next year.<br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  BBC</h3>By Alasdair Lamont BBC Scotland  <br>Comments (241)<br><br>Celtic were given a harsh lesson in Champions League knockout football by the old masters of Juventus.<br><br>Brimming with confidence on the back of some tremendous European performances and results, Neil Lennon&#39;s Celtic were picked off ruthlessly.<br><br>Alessando Matri put the Italian side ahead in the opening moments, taking advantage of poor defending.<br><br>Two late goals from Claudio Marchisio and Mirko Vucinic ensured the return leg will surely be a formality.<br>Celtic in Turin<br><br><br>Celtic were unable to lift themselves to the heights of the wins over Barcelona and Spartak Moscow in the group stage, although despite conceding an early goal they were dominant for large periods of the last-16 tie.<br><br>And as the match moved into its latter stages it was the Scottish team who looked most likely to score again before Juve twice more picked off their tiring opponents to take a firm grip on the contest.<br><br>Celtic midfielder Victor Wanyama sent a blistering shot goalwards with only a minute played, which Gigi Buffon turned round the post, as the Scottish side looked to capitalise on their passionate home support.<br><br>But with just three minutes gone a straight-forward looking long ball from Federico Peluso exposed the home side&#39;s defensive frailties.<br><br>Efe Ambrose - straight back in the team after featuring in Nigeria&#39;s Africa Cup of Nations success on Sunday - was caught underneath the ball and Matri was able to nudge him aside to slide it through Fraser Forster&#39;s legs and over the line, despite Kelvin Wilson&#39;s efforts to keep it out.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s response was to pepper Buffon&#39;s goal with shots from outside the box, with the Italian dealing well with efforts by Wanyama and Kris Commons, who also sent a wonderful overhead kick narrowly wide.<br><br>But for all their pressure, Celtic did little to truly threaten the Italian goal, while the crowd grew restless as a result of the referee&#39;s perceived unwillingness to give decisions in their side&#39;s favour, with grappling in the penalty area rarely punished.<br>Milestones for Juve<br><br>Juve, for their part, looked happy to soak up what Celtic had to throw at them and play on the counter-attack.<br><br>The home team&#39;s first clear view of goal came with more than an hour on the clock, but when it did materialise it should have brought about the equaliser.<br><br>Charlie Mulgrew&#39;s curling cross provided Ambrose with the ideal opportunity to atone for his earlier misjudgement, but his header was weak and straight at Buffon.<br><br>Celtic were then taught a lesson in incisive football when they fell further behind.<br><br>The deftest of touches by Matri found Marchisio, who twisted in from the left of the penalty area to stroke the ball beyond Forster.<br><br>Marchisio was heavily involved as Juventus effectively killed the tie with a third goal, putting the ball on a plate for Vucinic to beat the keeper from close range after Ambrose was again at fault and caught in possession.<br><br>Juventus sparkled only in flashes, but they did so brightly enough to record an ultimately commanding victory, with Celtic now heading to Turin looking to retain the respect already attained on this season&#39;s run.<br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>90:00 +3:05 Full time<br><br>Full Time The referee blows for the end of the match.<br>89:54<br><br>Victor Wanyama challenges Leonardo Bonucci unfairly and gives away a free kick.
