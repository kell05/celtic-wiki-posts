One  of the most controversial seasons ever is drawing to a close, however one last round of chaos at Tynecastle just about topped it all. <br><br>After  refereeing cover-ups, conspiracy theories and parliamentary summits to  discuss Old Firm matches, season 2010/11 added another chapter to its  book of infamy last night. In the 49th minute of play, Celtic&#39;s  celebrations following Gary Hooper&#39;s second goal were cut short. A man  leapt from Tynecastle&#39;s main stand to sprint down the track and assault  Lennon. The surprised Celtic manager barely had time to react before  stewards pounced on his assailant, but that did not stop Lennon swinging  his boot at the flattened thug several times. In fact, twice he  mistakenly connected with one of the grounded stewards as his rage took  over.<br><br>Few could blame him given the letter bombs, death threats,  24-hour security and everything else he has tolerated of late. No-one  should be subjected to physical abuse for simply doing their job,  especially when that job is managing a football team. Where was his  protection? Lennon hurled a few expletives at his attacker as he was  marched down the tunnel by police and the Irishman was later described  as &quot;shaken but fine&quot; by his assistant, Johann Mjallby.<br><br>Hearts may  now be punished. It might only have been one brainless buffoon but that  he emerged from a section of home supporters to attack Lennon leaves  the Edinburgh club open to possible sanctions from the Scottish Football  Association.<br><br>Perhaps there should also be action taken against  Celtic for the equally unacceptable conduct of their supporters in the  Roseburn Stand. Groups of them fought with police and stewards in the  aftermath of the attack on their manager, accompanied by deafening  chants of &quot;we are the IRA&quot;. Feet and punches were swung at the local  constabulary as things threatened to get completely out of control in  the away end.<br><br>On the field it was actually quite the opposite.  Celtic were in total command of a match they had to win to keep their  SPL title hopes alive. David Obua, Hearts&#39; Ugandan midfielder, was red  carded on 32 minutes for an innocuous slap at Charlie Mulgrew.<br><br>By then Celtic were already 1-0 ahead after Kris Commons had  dispossessed the dithering Marius Zaliukas to tee up Hooper for a  12th-minute opener.<br><br>Hooper struck the second to unwittingly spark mayhem shortly after the interval, then late in the game  Commons earned two cautions for diving and leaving the field of play  respectively, the second in celebration after he converted Celtic&#39;s  third.<br><br>The visitors dominated Hearts virtually from start to  finish but their performance was overshadowed by events shortly after  half-time. &quot;How the lad ever got through there needs to be looked at, we  don&#39;t condone it in any way,&quot; said Jim Jefferies, the Hearts manager.  &quot;Thankfully nobody, particularly Neil, was hurt. The club will help the  police and authorities to make sure that never happens again and that  the right course of action is taken against the person who got free.  It&#39;s just nonsense.<br><br>&quot;I never had a bad feeling before the game. I  thought it would be a great atmosphere but it was a different type of  atmosphere for some reason. Whether it was because we got beat at  Rangers on Saturday, and a week ago Celtic were in front and then handed  the initiative back to Rangers, these things boil up. They have a  chance to win the league on the last day now but I don&#39;t know if there  was something last night that was going to boil over.&quot;<br><br>Mjallby  echoed Jefferies&#39; sentiments. &quot;What happened to Neil, it&#39;s a dark day  for Scottish football. It&#39;s an absolute disgrace,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;ve never  seen anything like it. Obviously he (Lennon) is a bit shaken. I saw  someone coming and obviously we didn&#39;t react at first but we were  obviously a bit shocked, all of us.&quot;<br><br>Mjalby admitted the incident  could prompt Lennon to question his future as manager of Celtic. He  added: &quot;Of course Neil has had the death threat and obviously what can  you do? The guy could&#39;ve had anything in his hand. It was shocking. We  all know Neil is a strong character but how much can a guy take?&quot;<br><br>Hearts  will appeal the red card issued to Obua after referee Craig Thomson  acted on the advice of his assistant referee, Keith Sorbie. Jefferies  said Thomson told him Obua was dismissed for swinging a punch at Mulgrew  and stressed the sense of injustice did not help the simmering  atmosphere. &quot;I felt there was a bit of hostility in the atmosphere but  I&#39;ve got to say I don&#39;t think the linesman did the referee any favours.<br><br>&quot;You  always felt it was simmering but I think that incident sparked it off a  little bit more. I asked Craig what Obua was sent off for and he said  it was a punch. I was within inches of them and Charlie had a wee pop at  him (Obua) verbally and it was nothing. David brushed him aside. There  was no way that was a punch. To get sent off for that was a terrible  decision.&quot;<br><br>Hearts had started in buoyant mood since Dundee  United&#39;s defeat at Ibrox 24 hours previously confirmed the Edinburgh  club&#39;s place in Europe for next season.<br>But little more than half an hour in they were 1-0 down after another  aberration from their captain, who was caught in possession midway  inside his own half. Obua&#39;s sending off for raising a hand to push  Mulgrew in the back of the head made for an insurmountable hurdle. <br><br>Hooper  collected Ki Sung-Yeung&#39;s pass to poke the second beyond Kello, and  Commons executed an expert jink on Zaliukas to skin the Lithuanian and  drive home the third. The Scotland internationalist had been cautioned  for diving just moments before, and when he set off to celebrate with  Celtic supporters he earned a second yellow to  add to compound a night  of nonsense in Gorgie.<br>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none"

                      And the win means Celtic are a point behind leaders and holders Rangers ahead of Sunday&#39;s final round of games.</div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      Celtic had gone into what was always going to be a potentially  fiery encounter knowing that a defeat would hand the title to their  Glasgow rivals.                             <br><br>                            Lennon sprang a surprise in central defence, restoring Glenn  Loovens in place of Thomas Rogne, with Charlie Mulgrew moving up into  midfield in place of James Forrest as the Celtic manager perhaps  anticipated a bit of a battle.                             <br><br>                            The pre-match build-up had been given added spice by hints from  Lennon that teams, including Hearts, had been less than competitive  against title rivals Rangers in recent weeks.                             <br><br>                            Although Lennon denied he had suggested that Hearts had not been  trying, it was predicted that the remarks would provide extra  motivation for Jim Jefferies, his side and their fans.</div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      However, with Dundee United&#39;s defeat by Rangers ensuring that  Hearts will finish third, three points meant less for the Tynecastle men  and it was Celtic who were first to every ball from kick off.                             <br>                            Daniel Majstorovic, Hooper and Georgios Samaras, who had started  ahead of Daryl Murphy up front, all threatened as the ball bounced  dangerously around the home penalty box.                             <br><br>                            Hearts captain Marius Zaliukas was back in central defence,  along with Ismael Bouzid, after being left out against Rangers following  instructions from Hearts majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov.                             <br><br>                            The return of their first-choice central defensive pairing  should have strengthened the home side, but it was a mistake by the  Lithuanian international that handed Celtic the lead.                             <br><br>                            Zaliukas was dispossessed by Kris Commons as he looked to spray  the ball upfield and the Scotland winger fed it perfectly into the path  of Hooper for a simple, low finish past Marian Kello.                             <br><br>                            The inclusion of the goalkeeper, who had also been left out  recently for mysterious &quot;personal reasons&quot;, and striker Stephen Elliot  had Hearts close to full strength.                             <br><br>                            Celtic, though, were making them look like a side that had not  won a league match since 19 February and Commons twice in quick  succession came close to extending the lead.</div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      The winger&#39;s 18-yard drive was pushed superbly on to a post by  Kello and, when the ball was turned back into the six-yard box by Mark  Wilson, it deflected off the former Derby man&#39;s shin and flew a foot  wide of the unguarded net.                             <br><br>                            Ian Black had been lucky to escape a red card for an earlier  two-footed challenge on Samaras, but team-mate Obua could perhaps count  himself unfortunate to be given his marching orders.                             <br><br>                            Mulgrew had stuck his elbow forceably into the Uganda utility  man&#39;s chest and, although the Hearts player barely brushed his  opponents&#39; hairline with a flailing arm, the assistant referee ruled  that he had lifted his hand in retaliation.                             <br><br>                            Celtic virtually ended the game as a contest in the opening minutes of the second half.                             <br><br>                            Ki Sung-Yeung wriggled his way to the edge of the box and set up  Hooper for a clinical, low finish with the outside of his foot.                             <br><br>                            As the Celtic fans celebrated, one man advanced from the stands  and appeared to aim a punch at Lennon before being hauled away by  security.                             <br><br>                            The Celtic manager looked stunned before a smile eventually  returned to his face as Commons fired a powerful 25-yard drive just  wide.                             <br><br>                            Commons had another drive beaten away by Kello before Bouzid  provided Hearts&#39; first threat with a backward header that looped just  wide after 62 minutes.                             <br><br>                            The match finished in further controversy when Commons found the  net with a long-range effort before being sent off after picking up a  second yellow card for rushing into the crowd to celebrate.                             </div>
