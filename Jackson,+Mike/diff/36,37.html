He had been pursued by Manchester Utd but chose to become a <a href="/page/Kelly%27s+Kids" target="_self">Kelly Kid</a> (at Celtic) rather than a Busby Babe (at Man U).  <br><br><blockquote>  <i>&quot;I&#39;d been down at Old Trafford for a couple of weeks and played a couple of matches but when I received a telegram to come up and play for Celtic against Dunfermline, I jumped at the chance. Apart from the fact that I&#39;d supported them as a boy, I was getting homesick down south. So I came up and played, Celtic offered me a contract after the game and I signed for them that night.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>He made his debut in a goalless league clash with Dundee at Parkhead on December 7th that year, and things got little better for him in his time trying to make a name for himself as a player at Celtic. <br><br>A clever and elegant attacker Mike Jackson had a good eye for goal but was ultimately let down by a lack of real pace. <br><br>Mike Jackson came through the Celtic ranks with players who would ultimately go on to be Lisbon Lions (he was one of the feted &#39;Kelly Kids&#39;). In retrospect, his record was a very good one in goal scoring. Mike Jackson reflected back with hindsight that he might very well have been hasty but that he was frustrated at his lack of first team opportunities. <br><br>He took time to settle in and was a regular from the start of the 1958/59 season (a poor season for Celtic finishing 6th in the league), and came to the attention of many with a double scored in a 3-1 victory over Dunfermline in March 1959, both goals scored late on in the match to take Celtic to victory.<br><br>In the first half of the 1959/60 season, he was a regular scorer, but then was dropped out the First Team and wasn&#39;t back in as a starter until August 1961. Season 1959/60 wasn&#39;t a stellar one, as Celtic finished ninth in the league, but Mike Jackson had scored 8 goals in 12 league games and so could at least prove on paper that he was producing the goods. Looking at the games he played in that season, it was more the defence rather than the attack that was the problem.</div><div></div><div><br>Season 1961/62 was a better time, with Celtic finishing third behind Dundee &amp; Rangers, and Mike Jackson may not have been prolific but still scored a number of goals, including 3 doubles. However, he little scored against the tougher sides in the league that season, and that maybe reflected that he had now hit a glass ceiling. The season following he played little for the first team, his final match being a 1-1 draw with Kilmarnock in the league. <br><br>However, he did get to play in a bit of history in Celtic&#39;s first ever European competition match, a 4-2 defeat away to Valencia in the Inter-Cities Fair Cup (1st Round, 1st leg).</div><div></div><div><br>He was unfortunate in many ways. He made his debut not long after the magnificent league cup win of 1957 (7-1 over Rangers), but then Celtic were not to win another trophy till 1965. Celtic were heavily underachieving, and the environment was very poor for any aspiring player, with the club management increasingly demoralised by the constant inept meddling by the board as well as the increasingly apathetic coaching staff.<br><br>He made in total 74 appearances for Celtic in the main competitions and scored 30 goals before joining St Johnstone in April 1963.<br><br>He went on to have a long playing career before finally retiring from playing at the age of 41. He played for Third Lanark, Drumcondra, Athlone Town, Clyde, Morton, Queen of the South, Clydebank, Hamilton Accies and Benburb.<br><br>One little bit of trivia on Mike Jackson is that he used to think of himself as a bit of a crooner, and regularly mimicked brat-pack star Dean Martin. He was then given a nickname by his team-mates of &#39;<i>Dino</i>&#39; [pronounced <i>&#39;Dee-no</i>&#39;] but as Billy McNeill said that is despite only Mike believing that he actually sounded like the great old singer.</div><div><br><b>Post-Playing Career</b><br>After his playing career Mike Jackson put his excellent football brain to good knowledge working as a coach, manager and scout. He started as Reserve coach with Albion Rovers, coached Benburb in 1974 and became Queen of the South coach in September 1974. <br><br>He was then appointed manager at Palmerston Park from August 1975 to May 1978. During this time he was asked by Billy McNeill, then managing Aberdeen, of his opinion of a certain ginger-haired Dundee player, whom Queens had just beaten, by the name of Gordon Strachan. He replied that the young lad, unlike most of his fellow Dundee players had not stopped trying and running. On the basis of this recommendation McNeill signed Strachan to Aberdeen. <br><br>He continued his managing and coaching career with spells at Morton, Albion Rovers, Partick Thistle and back again to Queen of the South before finally joining Celtic as a scout in 1988. In 1987 when Jack McGinn wanted to bring Billy McNeill back to the club as manager the negotiations took place at Mike&#39;s house in Crosshill. Mike&#39;s scouting role at Celtic took the form of compiling vast dossiers on teams for Billy McNeill (including behind the Iron Curtain in West Berlin &amp; Budapest). <br><br>He eventually moved on to become involved in the Youth Training Scheme (YTS) in Scotland, a role which saw him point young footballers who failed to make the grade into other lines of work. His undoubted talents acquired through a long playing, coaching and managing career as well as his work with YTS led to Leeds Utd recruiting him as their scout for Scotland and was involved in recommending Mark Viduka to David O&#39;Leary at Leeds Utd in 1999.<br><br>Later he was working at Celtic, employed <font color="#333333">as a popular pundit on <a href="/page/Celtic+TV" target="_self">Celtic TV</a>, and was still very much <span class="diffAdd">(longlife) </span>friends with many of the great unit of players from the 1960s, in particular Billy McNeill and John Clark.</font><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career</h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1957-63</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  57</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  8</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  8</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  74</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals:</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  23</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  3</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  4</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  30</td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <div align="center">  Mike himself says that he scored 32 goals in 78 games, but this difference is due to that he is including Glasgow Cup games.</div>  <h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3>none  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Jackson%2C+Michael+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  </div><h3>  Mike Jackson: I will miss my best friend, Billy</h3><br>By: Joe Sullivan on 24 Apr, 2019 16:52<br>Tweet<br>http://www.celticfc.net/news/16073<br>THE most enduring of the friendships that Billy McNeill made in football was his bond with Mike Jackson. That friendship went on for over 60 years and went far beyond being just team-mates, and the former Celt was distraught at the plight and the passing of his best pal.<br><br>Mike said: &ldquo;I was up to see him every other day, but it was a blessing that God took him. As much as I&rsquo;d love him to be here with me, it&rsquo;s a relief for him.<br><br>&ldquo;He was such a lovely, big, principled man. I was the best man when he and Liz got married. I first met him in 1957 and we all trained together at night, three nights a week at Celtic Park.<br><br>&ldquo;Everything came from there and since 1957, we&rsquo;ve been best pals. My kids and their children are like brothers and sisters &ndash; just one great big family. As friends we were in each other&rsquo;s pockets all of the time and the friendship has continued right down to our children and I&rsquo;ll miss him awfully &ndash; it was so sad.&rdquo;<br><br>Mike also revealed that Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever on-field motivator wasn&rsquo;t just a captain on the pitch, but off-field as well.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;He was a born leader, even back in the early days arranging holidays. The first time a crowd of us went away on holiday, it was to the Channel Islands. There was the likes of John Divers and Jim Conway there at the time, and Billy organised all of that.<br><br>&ldquo;We were saying, &lsquo;Where will we go?&rsquo; Billy said, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ve never been to the Channel Islands, let&rsquo;s go there,&rsquo; and a year later he was saying, &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go to Spain.&rsquo; Billy organised everything for those trips.<br><br>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we called him Cesar, as he was the captain and he ran the ship, and made sure everybody was alright. We&rsquo;d have been lost without him. In fact, we wouldn&rsquo;t have gone anywhere.&rdquo;<br><br>He added: &ldquo;I was honoured to be the best man at his wedding and that friendship had gone right down to our children, who, like us, have lived out of each other&rsquo;s pockets.<br><br>&ldquo;I lost my wife 18 years ago and I was never out of the McNeill house as it was a second home to me. He was such a nice man and it was a pleasure and an honour to have known him.&rdquo;<br><br>The Celtic team line-up from the picture above:<br>Back row: Dunky MacKay, Neilly Mochan, Frank Haffey, Eric Smith, Billy McNeill<br>Front row: Matt McVittie, Jim Conway, Bertie Peacock, Mike Jackson, Sammy Wilson, Bertie Auld<br><br><div>(Derry City v Celtic, May 17, 1958) </div><div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3></div><div></div><br></div>
