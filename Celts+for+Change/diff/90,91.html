Individual boycotts of the matches saw attendance figures hit lows but there was no organised movement or direction.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000">In 1993, a group of concerned Celtic supporters banded together to form the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; pressure group in order to challenge the frustration and near-impotence that many fans were feeling over the events surrounding our club. The aim and focus was to channel all the supporters&#39; energies in one direction to push for change in the club. <br><br>The original and main committee members were:</font> <br><ul>  <li><font color="#000000">David Cunningham (co-founder of &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39;),</font></li><li><font color="#000000">Brendan Sweeney</font> (co-founder of &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39;, later of the <a href="/page/Celtic+sites+-+Jungle+Bhoys" target="_self">Jungle Bhoys</a> group and <a href="/page/Supporters+-+Celtic+Graves+Society" target="_self">Celtic Graves Society</a>)<br>  </li><li><a href="/page/Supporters+-+Matt+McGlone" target="_self">Matt McGlone</a><font color="#000000"> (editor of the belligerent &#39;<a href="/page/Once+A+Tim" target="_self">Once a Tim</a>&#39; fanzine and later the &#39;<a href="/page/The+Alternative+View" target="_self">Alternative View</a>&#39; magazine)</font>   </li><li><font color="#000000">Colin Duncan, </font>  </li><li>  <font color="#000000">John Thompson.</font></li></ul><font color="#000000">Notably this wasn&#39;t the first organised group, and the demise of the original &#39;<a href="/page/Save+Our+Celts" target="_self">Save Our Celts</a>&#39; group back in around 1990 was always something to bear in mind. The situation at Celtic had worsened since then and this time there was no way back for the group without potentially losing the club as well.</font>   <br><br><b>Organisation &amp; Action Points</b><br><font color="#000000">Word spread quickly (aided by the </font><font color="#000000"><font color="#000000">&#39;<a href="/page/Once+A+Tim" target="_self">Once a Tim</a>&#39;</font> fanzine) and the group quickly put together various courses of action in order to be able to push for change whilst finely balancing their actions without hurting the team on the pitch. The latter was an impossible mission, and there&rsquo;s no doubt the off-field tensions were hampering the on-field results but there was nothing that could be done about this.</font> <br><img align="right" alt="Sack the Board, Back the Team - Celts for Change" height="487" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/r4o129AmyoeMQt8mapDk3w78786/GW335H487" title="Sack the Board, Back the Team - Celts for Change" width="335"><br><font color="#000000">The group organised various modes of direct action to highlight the club&#39;s plight. Regular town hall meetings grew in size and later influence, starting from an initial meeting of just 50 people to full halls of hundreds of people in a short space of time. Demonstrations outside the &#39;Bank of Scotland&#39; head offices (Celtic&#39;s then bankers) drew increased media attention with newspapers and television taking note, and escalated the campaign for the board&rsquo;s removal. &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; was empowering the support in the struggle and quickly after years of disillusionment the support in increasing numbers was backing the group as their best option to vent their views. It was a sad indictment of the old board that it had to come to this.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000">One of the most notable actions by the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; was to declare an official boycott of the re-arranged game on 2nd March 1994 v Kilmarnock. Unknown to the board, &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; had employed an agency to calculate and count the actual numbers who did turn up at the game, having a person stand at each turnstile to count the numbers going in. Their attendance estimate was around 8225, the official club figure was around 10,055. This difference at first may seem insignificant to some, but the 10k figure actually was a significant benchmark as it was an estimated break-even attendance requirement for the club to remain operationally profitable. The level was breached and it can be taken that the organised boycott was a success albeit a sad one as well (no one wants to hurt their club but it was the only way to force change). </font><br><br><font color="#000000">There were some errors made and the group was not immune to criticism. At one of the larger meetings, Matt McGlone on stage phoned up Michael Kelly (a then member of the Celtic board) at his home to get him to answer to the audience. It was an attention grabbing stunt but even some &#39;<i>Celts For Change</i>&#39; supporters claimed it was intrusive and unnecessary. Regardless of the group&rsquo;s aims, Michael Kelly should not have been accosted as he was when he is at home (likely with family). It was underhand and reflected poorly on the group. If a media person had done this to one of the Celtic players, the support would have been incensed about the intrusion.<br><br>The organised boycotts were also criticised. For some, watching Celtic is one of the few real pleasures and escapes they have in life, and the organised boycott created friction between certain sections of fans, some seeing it as contradicting the maxim to &quot;<i>Sack the Board, Back the Team</i>&quot;. However, in fairness to &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39;, a boycott was probably their strongest and only real weapon, and the only way to accelerate the whole process. It produced results despite any short-term damage it may have made to the club.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000">One thing has to be made quite clear about the group. Daft rumours amongst a paranoid minority were spreading that the members were in the pockets of the &#39;<i>Rebel</i>&#39; shareholders (e.g. Brian Dempsey, Fergus McCann &amp; David Low etc). At one point, allegations were made that the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; organisers were working on behalf of the &#39;<i>Rebel</i>&#39; shareholders. All this was nonsense as some had never even met any of the senior players amongst the &#39;<i>Rebel</i>&#39; shareholders. It was a difficult and stressful time, and showed how petty &amp; nasty it was getting. On the other hand, it is a fair question to ask but the most these guys actually got through the whole travails was a free pint or two from the meeting attendees.</font> <br><br>Disappointingly, the more established Celtic Supporters&#39; Affiliation &amp; Association groups were not very supportive at first with some initially unhelpful public comments from some leading members. There is a myth that the whole support was fully united against the old board. The reality was that there really were differing viewpoints with a small minority even still behind the old board (including one very vociferous proponent called Gerry McSherry). The &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; <span class="diffAdd">group </span>had to go through a lot to prove themselves for the majority to actually get behind them, and finally galvanise the support into a concerted effort to help bring about change.<br><br><b>The Board&#39;s final downfall...</b><br><font color="#000000">The end game in 1994 was one played out mostly by the major shareholders and financiers, but the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; men were the ones who through their efforts had laid the foundations and created the environment to provide confidence to the Rebel investors (such as McCann and Keane) that Celtic had substance and was worth fighting for. Without them, other outside investors could have come in and would have acted as vultures after waiting till the club entered administration (which was thankfully avoided).<br><br>&#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; were there throughout, organising members and sympathisers in picketing outside the club&#39;s offices as talks went on inside. The celebrations as the announcements were made that the board was ousted led to the loudest cheers heard at Parkhead for many a year, and relief and satisfaction for the &#39;Celts for Change&#39; organisers of a job well done. They&#39;d played an important part in the whole set of events. As the Finance Advisor to the Rebel Group, David Low, put it:<br></font><blockquote><div><i>&quot;There is no doubt the emergence of Celts for Change was a catalyst  that brought the takeover to a successful and rapid conclusion. The  movement exploded onto the scene and when ordinary fans in numbers  started making their feelings known, picketing the bank and exerting  pressure, the Board had no chance. They were instrumental in bringing  about the necessary change.&quot;</i></div></blockquote><br><font color="#000000">The victory was sweet but there were personal costs to the group organisers which outsiders never knew. Taking in the amount of time and energy that the whole campaign and organisation took up, some members had to deal with personal costs and issues in terms of lost time with family but also damaged relationships with family and friends stemming from their work for the group.</font><br><br><font color="#000000">So why did they do it all and carry on with all that it entailed? The members were doing it simply for their love of the club and their fellow fans on the terracing. The club has an ethos and broad community that no other club has, and that is what fuelled them to push for change. </font><br><br><font color="#000000">At the end of it all, whilst many of the &#39;Rebel&#39; shareholders were themselves wealthy men and found themselves to have won control of the club, the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; organisers simply went back onto the terracing with the gratitude and respect of the support. Matt McGlone in time an exception by being offered a small role at Celtic. <br><br>The revolution instituted by Fergus McCann has made many almost unaware of the club&#39;s previous state, and even blas&eacute; about it. This is dangerous, and everyone must at one point remind themselves of what the club had gone through to get to where it is now. Celtic were literally minutes away from administration. Everyone should remember the part that the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; organisers played in the history of the club and the struggle for its survival; they are not just a mere footnote. Too often their part has been sidelined, and this must be addressed by all commentators reflecting on that era. </font><br><br><font color="#000000">The people behind &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; are what the soul of Celtic is all about, and for their part in the removal of the old Biscuit Tin board from the club, the Celtic support will forever respect them. A set of truly deserving people who had been for too long a bunch of unsung heroes. The Celtic fans will always hold them in high esteem for all that they did beyond what could ever be asked of anyone.</font><br><br><b>Post-Script<br></b>In May 2013, with renovations being carried out around Celtic Park in preparation for the Commonwealth Games of 2014, the &#39;<i>Celts for Change</i>&#39; group was officially honoured with a plaque at Celtic Park. <br><br>This plaque is situated in front of the Jimmy Johnstone Statue at the front end of Celtic Park, and is a fitting tribute to the main people behind the group. <br><br>Belatedly done some may <span class="diffRemove">say</span><span class="diffAdd">argue</span> but maybe time needs to pass before honouring people in this way. <br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Celts for Change - Pic" height="559" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/ieGIHwqw4gQQIZVnkf5ZLQ143286/GW747H559" title="Celts for Change - Pic" width="747"><br><br>McGlone.

Pure panic set, all the writing had came off during the wash cycle &amp; he thought how am I going 2 explain that 1 to the Bhoys, the other was the fight 2 get it in2 the ground as the stewards had been alerted to refuse its entry, so David Cunningham wrapped it up inside his coat. Never to be beaten &amp; refused entry with the banners we eventually came up with the sweatshirt idea. The Celts For Change efforts, journey &amp; memories are priceless.

Five supporters formed the group back in 1993 in a bid to challenge the frustrations that fans were feeling towards the direction the club were heading in.<br><br>Brendan Sweeney, Colin Duncan, Matt McGlone, David Cunningham and John Thompson were the original members whose efforts helped bring vital change to the club, with Fergus McCann taking over and saving the club in March 1994.<br><br>Four of the Celts for Change founders were reunited at Celtic Park last weekend.<br><br>A paving stone was dedicated to the group at the foot of the Jimmy Johnstone statue, at the front door to Paradise. The engraving reads: &lsquo;Celtic Football Club acknowledges the efforts of the &lsquo;Celts for Change&rsquo; supporters&rsquo; group September 1993 &ndash; March 4th 1994 in helping to bring change at the Club.&rsquo;<br><br>Celtic Chief Executive Peter Lawwell, who unveiled the paving stone, praised the Celts for Change founders for their efforts. He expressed his delight at the club&acute;s turnaround since the early 1990s and how the Celtic supporters can now enjoy dominance in Scottish football.<br><br>&quot;This is a very special football club and unique in many ways,&quot; Peter Lawwell said, &quot;and in my view that&acute;s mainly down to the supporters.<br><br>&ldquo;It&acute;s great for the families to be here to see first-hand what their fathers, their brothers and sons have achieved for Celtic.<br><br>&ldquo;The uniqueness of the Celtic support is they found leaders who wanted to hold the people in charge to account. Being second, third or fourth to Rangers wasn&rsquo;t good enough for Celtic and that was the catalyst, it was the turning point.<br><br>&ldquo;The ownership has led to a consistency in the board, the management and the objectives of the club and in football the prize for stability is massive. Dermot Desmond has provided that over the years. He has guided that and directed that, and at the end of the day we are in a position, in 2013, where we are the dominant force in Scottish football. That&acute;s where we are today and it&acute;s our intention to keep that going for many years.&quot;<br><br>The Celts for Change group attracted the backing of supporters when they began in 1993 and they continue to earn the respect of those who can now see the long-lasting effects.<br><br>Brendan Sweeney, however, was keen to stress that it was down to the efforts of all the Celtic fans.<br><br>&quot;We weren&rsquo;t there to tell the fans what to do,&quot; he explained. &quot;We were there to do what the fans wanted us to do, we were representing them. We were five working-class guys from The Jungle, with all different opinions, but we all shared the same bond.<br><br>&quot;It&acute;s fantastic to have this plaque. For me it signifies the people at the club and how in touch they are with the Celtic supporters. For 20 years we&acute;ve seen a lot of people come and go but the support is the one thing that remains constant.<br><br>&quot;That&acute;s here no matter who comes and goes. To organise this is a fantastic and generous act, and it&acute;s really fitting 20 years after it was formed. It&acute;s very humbling. We could never have dreamed, 20 years ago, of having the club we have just now.&quot;<br><br>Matt McGlone was equally proud and reflected on the long-term success the group have achieved.<br><br>&quot;If you create something from the heart, then you will always get a result,&quot; he said. &quot;That&acute;s what this group did and there has been a massive change in this club from 1994 and has been carried on.<br><br>&quot;The tarmac was laid down for people like Peter and his predecessors to build on something, and when you look at the club just now you can see how dominant we are.<br><br>&quot;Even if there was a single brick that would have been great but there&acute;s a huge stone and I&acute;m eternally grateful. The group&acute;s name is outside the front door at Celtic Park and that&acute;s magnificent.<br><br>&quot;I think more people realise what was achieved now, more than they did 20 years ago. But it&acute;s not about me, it&acute;s not about individuals, it&acute;s about the tens of thousands supporters who took it on. I&acute;m totally in awe of the stone and I thank the club for it.&quot;<br><br>The intentions of the group were heartfelt and gained widespread support from fellow Celtic fans. Colin Duncan explained why he got involved.<br><br>&quot;It meant everything at the time,&quot; he said. &quot;Celtic, and my son, meant the world to me so to be involved was a privilege. We wanted to lend a hand to try and bring something new to Celtic.<br><br>&quot;This stone is very well-deserved and even if I take myself out of the equation I can see how much the other guys put into it. They were all very determined because they all loved Celtic.&quot;<br><br>David Cunningham echoed those sentiments. He said: &quot;It all started back when the club was going through a really bad spell. A few of us got together because we didn&rsquo;t want to see our club going down the tubes.<br><br>&quot;It grew from there and we helped change the club around. It was great at the time and it&acute;s still great. It&acute;s now really nice to have this stone, I&acute;m really proud of it and it&acute;s been a great opportunity for us to get together again and celebrate it.&quot; <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3>  <h3>  </h3><br><img align="bottom" alt="Banner - Pic" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/hpOO_QX5ZXXkJvKO2PSzDg1103690" title="Banner - Pic"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Celts for Change - The Celtic Wiki" height="670" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/58149e09d41bc0ff26c817f3b42498ad/GW750H670" title="Celts for Change - The Celtic Wiki" width="750"><br><h3>  </h3><br></div>
