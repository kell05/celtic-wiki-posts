It&#39;s a bit like   saying to Orson Welles: &quot;Yes, yes, Citizen Kane, greatest movie ever,   blah blah. Now, tell me about those sherry commercials...&quot;  But the   League Cup is what we&#39;ve gathered in Newton Mearns to discuss, and   Fallon, a lovely old man with a craggy face, a rasping Irish brogue and a   wife who&#39;s sat on the edge of her seat in case she&#39;s needed as a   prompt, is too polite and too modest to attempt to seize hold of the   agenda. Trouble is, if I&#39;m feeling disconcerted, so is Fallon. &quot;It&#39;s so   long ago, son,&quot; he says. &quot;In my career I got too many kicks in the  head,  and too many times I had to head that big heavy ball away. The  rule was  it was only supposed to be 16 ounces, blown up. But see when  water got  into it? Like a bloody cannonball, so it was. If you got in  the way of a  cracking shot you&#39;d be waking up in the infirmary, asking  what the  score was.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">We shouldn&#39;t be surprised that Fallon is  struggling to  remember that 1956 victory over Partick Thistle. He will  be 89 in July  and the last time he counted, there were only two other  survivors from  the 3-0 win and one of them suffers from Alzheimer&#39;s.  There&#39;s isn&#39;t  really scope for a class of &#39;56 reunion. Add to that,  Celtic&#39;s  relationship with this competition has always been pretty  eccentric.  They would later appear in 14 consecutive finals, winning  six in a row  then losing four on the trot &ndash; but it took them all of the  League Cup&#39;s  first decade to get their name etched on it. Dundee had  won it twice by  then, and East Fife three times. To cap it all, the &#39;56  final was  decidedly non-classic, despite Celtic and Thistle having two  goes.  According to The Scotsman, the first match in front of a crowd  of 59,000  was hugely disappointing, an &quot;inept&quot; affair with Celtic  mostly to  blame. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The Wednesday afternoon replay, for which the  attendance almost  halved, was &quot;another poor display from both teams ...  drab and  blundering&quot;. Who&#39;d want to remember any of that? I&#39;m just  about to say,  &quot;Sorry, Mr Fallon, I&#39;ll not detain you any longer on this  fine,  daffodil-budding afternoon&quot; when he breaks into a smile. &quot;Billy  McPhail,  he got two of our goals. Billy was the younger brother of  John, who  played for us before &ndash; both grand lads. John was nicknamed  Hooky because  he aye kicked with the outside of his foot. Billy, a  hairdresser to  trade, was Teasy-Weasy. John went out of the game pretty  early. He liked  his wee drink &ndash; most of the players did. And Billy,  don&#39;t you know,  died of brain damage. Too much heading of that bloody  big ball!&quot; Then  Fallon looks over to Myra, his wife of 52 years, and  says: &quot;Did I do all  right? Do you still love me?&quot; And Myra says: &quot;Yes,  if you up my  housekeeping.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sean and Myra have one son and five  daughters and  the youngest of them, Siobhan, has popped in for the next  chapter of his  story, the almost mythical 7-1 drubbing of Rangers with  which Celtic  kept hold of the League Cup, even though everyone in the  family,  including all the grandchildren, must have heard it a thousand  times  before. Fallon, as we&#39;ve established, isn&#39;t a boastful man; he  just gets  asked about that game a lot. It remains the biggest winning  margin in  any British final, the biggest in an Old Firm game and  Rangers&#39; heaviest  defeat. &quot;We hadn&#39;t been doing that well, and Rangers  were top dogs in  Scotland,&quot; says Fallon. &quot;But that day everything went  right for us and  it all went wrong for them.&quot; A crowd of 82,253  witnessed what The  Scotsman called &quot;the most astonishing final ever  staged&quot;. Rangers, in  the quaint language of the time, were lacking  &quot;something akin to  sociable cordiality&quot;, their defence &quot;affected by  indecision to a  paralytic degree&quot;.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic &quot;knew a bad team when  they saw one&quot; and  rattled in goals of &quot;magnificent precision, such as  can only be  described in boys&#39; serial story papers&quot;.&quot;Of course we were  elated at the  end,&quot; adds the left-back. &quot;But more for the supporters  than ourselves. I  remember the manager Mr (Jimmy] McGrory&#39;s team talk.  Very stirring, so  it was. He told us to think about all those people  who&#39;d stood out there  in the rain, hail and snow and how much we owed  them. &#39;For God&#39;s sake,&#39;  he said, &#39;give them a performance today.&#39; I  think they were pretty  enamoured with what we did.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Billy McPhail  helped himself to three  more goals &ndash; all with his head. There was  crowd trouble involving what  The Scotsman termed &quot;brawling,  bottle-throwing hooligans&quot;. Five of the  goals were missed off the TV  coverage; a lens cap was blamed, although  some Celtic fans accused BBC  Scotland of a Rangers-favouring conspiracy.  The Gers goalie was George  Niven and &quot;What&#39;s the time? ... Seven past  Niven!&quot; became a popular  Glasgow street-corner exchange, with the win  also being celebrated in a  song which ripped off a Harry Belafonte hit.  Did Fallon and his  team-mates &ndash; fellow Irishmen Bertie Peacock and  Charlie Tully among  them, along with the two Bobbys, Collins and Evans &ndash;  commiserate with  the opposition? &quot;We tried, but we couldn&#39;t find them!  They must have  been hurting because Celtic v Rangers was a great, great  rivalry in our  day, too, although I had good friends in the Rangers  ranks, guys like  Corky and Deedle (George Young, Willie Waddell].</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The  League Cup  had been a bit of a bogey tournament for us up until those  years, but I  think for Celtic fans even now it&#39;s still special and  that&#39;s because  of 7-1.&quot; The tale of how Sean Fallon came to play for  Celtic is another  that appears to have been ripped from the pages of the  Hotspur or the  Hornet. He advises me to have another slice of sponge  cake while he  tries to remember it, but the old memory-box is whirring  nicely now. &quot;A  few miles up the coast from Sligo, where I was born,  there was a  little seaside resort called Strandhill. Scots lads used to  go on  holiday there and see if they could pick up girls. But swimming at   Strandhill was tricky, and one time my sister Lily got into   difficulties. I was a lifeguard but wasn&#39;t there that day and her   rescuer turned out to be the son of &#39;Nap&#39; McMenemy, who was a grand   player for Celtic. &quot;Our two families became very friendly and they&#39;d   send me across Celtic books and strips. I liked Gaelic football but the   high heid yins who ran it looked down on &#39;soccer&#39;, which was a bloody   stupid attitude, so I think I ended up choosing football because of   that. &quot;And when it came to going full-time with a club &ndash; I was a   confectioner to trade &ndash; Celtic were my team because my father, who was   in the Great War and got hit by a dum-dum in the Dardanelles, was   hospitalised into Glasgow, where he used to watch them play. West Brom   offered me much more money but I&#39;d always dreamed of going to Celtic,   even though they were tight with the old pennies.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In his first   full season, 1950-51, Celtic won the Scottish Cup, beating Motherwell   1-0. Three years later, the Hampden attendance again topped 130,000 for a   2-1 triumph over Aberdeen which completed the double. &quot;We couldn&#39;t   score a goal &ndash; our first had been an o.g. &ndash; so I got put up front and   managed to get the winner. Not bad for a full-back.&quot; But the 1950s,   especially when compared with the revolution effected by Stein, were   lean for Celtic. &quot;Scottish football was a lot more competitive back   then,&quot; says Fallon, who had a spell as captain. &quot;Apart from Rangers,   Aberdeen were always tough. Clyde won a cup, didn&#39;t they? Every club   seemed to get a wee shot. And games with Hibs and Hearts were aye   lively. Gordon Smith at Hibs &ndash; what a beautiful footballer although he   was a contrary fellow who kind of looked down on you. Against Hearts one   time I got my collar bone broken.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Myra: &quot;Wasn&#39;t it Sammy Baird of Rangers who did that?&quot; &quot;No, Sammy wouldn&#39;t have dared. He&#39;d have known I&#39;d have come after him.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Arm   in a sling, Fallon played on that day. His nickname was &quot;Iron Man&quot; but   he says he no more deserved the appellation than any other 1950s   footballer. &quot;You played hard, you got up again &ndash; not like now. But the   thing that wasn&#39;t in Celtic&#39;s favour at that time was our age. We  were  getting on in years and a lot more pace had started coming into  the  game.&quot; Myra is laughing. &quot;Tell him,&quot; she says. &quot;Well,&quot; says Fallon,  &quot;I  lied about my age to get signed. I said I was 24; really I was 28. Mr   McGrory found out when a lot of us had to get passports for a foreign   trip. He wasn&#39;t happy but a lovely man, so he was.&quot; Creaking  they might  have been &ndash; John McPhail borrowed a trick from Ferenc Puskas  of  shortening his stride to give the impression of speed &ndash; but the  Celtic  of the 50s had a great camaraderie, and old pals are flashing  through  Fallon&#39;s mind now. &quot;Bobby Collins, rare wee player &ndash; heart of a  lion.  Willie Fernie, Fife boy, great touch, kept the ball so close. Neil   Mochan &ndash; scored the best of the seven against Rangers. Billy Craig &ndash;   ach, whenever anyone was injured we&#39;d give him a game. </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">I&#39;m kidding, he   was Myra&#39;s brother. &quot;And Charlie Tully! Wonderful player, awfie man. My   digs were in Rutherglen, Miss McGuigan&#39;s, and Charlie would stay over  if  he had a drink in him rather than face the wife. I&#39;ll never forget  the  first time he sat on the ball &ndash; against Rangers! No-one, as far as I   knew, had ever done that before. Their players looked stunned. We all   used to get given passes to games, and Charlie always played with them   in the pocket of his shorts. If he was playing well he&#39;d hand them out   to the opposition: &#39;Here, you&#39;d be better off watching me from the   stand.&#39; In a cup-tie at Falkirk he scored two goals straight from   corners.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Tully was among those who questioned the signing of   Jock Stein as a centre-half from Llanelli. &quot;A few of the guys thought he   was too old. When I was captain I made him my vice-captain so he&#39;d get   more respect. At that point it was still a secret that I was actually   five months older than Jock!&quot; Stein didn&#39;t forget that gesture and when   he became Celtic manager he made Fallon, forced into retirement  through  injury after 254 appearances plus eight caps for the Republic  of  Ireland, his No 2. A reserve-team trainer, he&#39;d made a couple of key   signings before Stein took charge. &quot;I brought Ronnie Simpson in. We&#39;d   had a string of goalies who&#39;d been bloody terrible. I also brought back   Bertie Auld. Jock said to me: &#39;Jesus, you&#39;ve signed trouble.&#39; but that   one worked out fine as well.&quot;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The Fallon signings continued to   flow into what became the Lisbon Lions team, also the one after that:   Bobby Lennox, Tommy Gemmell, Kenny Dalglish, Danny McGrain. Later,   managing Dumbarton, he was supposed to have tried to lure a   veteran-class Johan Cryuff to Boghead. &quot;Ach, sorry to disappoint you,   son, but that was a publicity wheeze. I kidded on I&#39;d gone out to   Amsterdam to meet him. Jock had a million made-up stories designed to   gain a wee advantage. I was trying to play you press-boys like him. &quot;We   hit it off right from the start, the Big Man and me. In our playing  days  there was a ritual after training of going to Ferrari&#39;s in  Sauchiehall  Street for our lunch, and Jock and me would always be  trying to see what  films were showing at the Paramount across the road.  Sometimes Bertie  Peacock would come with us. We loved Westerns the  best. Jock&#39;s favourite  was John Wayne; mine was Gary Cooper.&quot; </span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Cooper  seemed to get through an  entire shoot-&#39;em-up career using only &quot;Yup&quot;  and &quot;Nope&quot;. In the dugout  alongside Fallon, Stein was similarly a man  of few words. &quot;He was too  busy concentrating on the game. I can still  see him grinding his fist  into his palm. He opened his mouth at  half-time, of course, but what he  said was always instructive. He knew  football so well.&quot; Lisbon was  thrilling confirmation of that &ndash; the  night Stein, like his cowboy hero,  got to be called John. By 1967,  Celtic had League Cups coming out of  their ears but a decade before,  they were relieved to have finally won  it once. &quot;Just a wee piece of  the history,&quot; says Fallon with his  customary deference.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Nice  story, nice man, but I worry that I&#39;ve  tired him out. &quot;No no, I&#39;m just  getting warmed up. I want to make it to  90, you know.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t we just,&quot;  laughs Myra.  </span></div>
