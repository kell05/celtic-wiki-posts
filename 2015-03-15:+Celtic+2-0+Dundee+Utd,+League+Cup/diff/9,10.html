Papers and TV try to make a hoo-haa over it. Thing is that when you look at the pictures, it doesn&#39;t add up (Broony in pictures from the day in training has his head shaven but the night out picture shows him with longer hair, so likely the press taking an older picture and trying to stoke up trouble). <br> </li><li>14-year-old Celtic fan Jordan Mount leads the team out for the match. Proud moment for him and his family. He has special needs but is a die-hard who watches the Celts at Celtic Park. <br> </li><li>Minutes applause led by Dundee Utd fans for Frank Kopel (RIP) &amp; the campaign for free care to dementia sufferers under 65. He was a very good player from the 70s who died at the age of 59 from dementia. He was too young to qualify for care - -diagnosed at 53 - there is a campaign by his family to change that.</li><li>Guidettie stropy at end of game as he didn&#39;t get to take the penalty in the match. He went down the tunnel, but came back out and in fairness was amicable with the rest thereafter.<br></li><li>Incredibly, VVD red card from last Sunday is rescinded. Very unexpected but welcome by Celtic fans en masse. Celtic had made a strongly worded statement about the red card. <br> </li><li>Celtic to play Dundee Utd incredibly four times in the space of two weeks (league, league cup, Scottish Cup and Scottish Cup replay). <br> </li><li>Guidetti ends up in a little giggle situation after singing a song for an interview that has the line &quot;The Huns are Deid&quot; which seems to create dumb comments from some sections of the media, the Zombies and Nil By Mouth. <br> </li><li>Paper talk: Celtic &lsquo;look to sign [Liverpool legend] Steven Gerrard on loan&rsquo;. <br> </li><li>Sevco get a new fan appointed director on board, he is soon enough put under investigation for posting an offensive Islamphobic picture on Twitter.

Didn&#39;t see Jackie  McNamara&#39;s comments and probably never will.  Very very pleased that  the manager&#39;s got a trophy to show, hope there are two more on the way.<br><br>As  for the game, we didn&#39;t look so hot for large stretches, and I didn&#39;t  think much of Stokes&#39; performance (I know others did, I have to go back  and look again).  Commons did his Commons thing, which is to suck most  of the time and then get you a goal.  Excellent work by him, Guidetti  and Forrest are two players who seem to be showing an unseemly amount of  desperation, that whole penalty incident was an awkward waste.  I  thought Johansen was off, Brown was quiet and Biton was restrained but  did his job in midfield.  Craig Gordon continues to be an absolute star.<br><br>And the ref had a good game.  Shocking stuff.   						 						 						 					<br><br>(joe lead of KDS)<br> Easier than thought it would be.  Main points for me:<br>- We now have a knack of winning when not playing our best<br>- Efe had me twitching a couple of times and cant believe DU didn&#39;t exploit him<br>- No. 25 is my favourite number - not quite Lubo but not seen as much commitment and ability for a long time<br>- Broonie a bit subdued, must have had a bad pizza<br>-  Stokes had his best game for a while, took the easy option in his  distribution at the start, as his confidence grew he tried some clever  balls that deserves credit<br>- Izzy had a very heavy left foot at  times, no he&#39;s not world class but there are few LFBs around and he is  better than the the vast majority<br>- Jackie McNM is not the best of managers and failed to exploit our weaknesses<br>-  Guidetti is not a Celtic Striker, he doesn&#39;t want to be here nd he  doesn&#39;t like having a crack at goal and will travel far to ensure he  doesn&#39;t have to<br>- Bitton is really a ghost he has a knack of creating a situation without breaking sweat or changing pace<br>- Not all referees are against us as it was a push rather than shoulder to shoulder<br>- I want to take the next penalty<br>- Its amazing how quickly a new pitch can be created<br>- Ronnie is the way forward<br>- Drinking on a Sunday is great<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Dundee United</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Cierzniak         </li><li>    02  Dillon   Dismissed      </li><li>    14  Morris         </li><li>    05  Fojut         </li><li>    03  Dixon         </li><li>    16  McGowan   Booked      </li><li>    20  Butcher         </li><li>    06  Paton   Booked   (Erskine - 72&#39;

It is one down, two to go for the Norwegian coach in his pursuit of the elusive domestic treble after his team claimed the League Cup for the 15th time in the club&rsquo;s history.<br><br>Scorers: Celtic - Commons (28), Forrest (79)<br><br>This was far from the most distinguished or thrilling final this competition has ever produced but Celtic merited their first piece of silverware under Deila&rsquo;s guidance, goals by Kris Commons and James Forrest taking the trophy to Parkhead for the first time in six years.<br><br>For Dundee United, it was a second successive disappointment in major finals after their loss to St Johnstone in the Scottish Cup last May.<br><br>Jackie McNamara&rsquo;s side were left to reflect on a wretched afternoon for their captain Sean Dillon who was off the field injured when Celtic opened the scoring in the first half and who was then sent off 11 minutes into the second half to scupper their hopes of a recovery. Celtic could even afford the luxury of a missed penalty by Forrest in the closing stages.<br><br>The four-match series between these teams now moves on to Wednesday&rsquo;s Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Celtic Park, the next hurdle between Deila and that treble only previously achieved for Celtic by Jock Stein and Martin O&rsquo;Neill.<br>Virgil Van Dijk and Kris Commons celebrate after the latter opened the scoring. Picture: Lisa Ferguson Virgil Van Dijk and Kris Commons celebrate after the latter opened the scoring. Picture: Lisa Ferguson<br><br>The recently relaid playing surface at Hampden certainly looked much better than the rutted pitch which had disfigured the semi-finals of this tournament, although there were still a few irregular bounces which suggested it was far from perfect.<br><br>It perhaps explained why neither side were able to fully find their passing rhythm, with countless moves from both breaking down in and around the penalty areas.<br><br>Celtic were the more threatening<br><br>in the early stages of the match and Dillon came to his team&rsquo;s rescue in the third minute when he cleared off the line after Virgil van Dijk had risen to meet an Anthony Stokes corner from the left.<br><br>A mistake by Calum Morris, recalled to the centre of United&rsquo;s defence after injury, presented Celtic with their next sight of goal. Leigh Griffiths pounced upon a badly underhit passback from Morris and after taking the ball around goalkeeper Radoslaw Cierzniak, the striker might have done better than drag his shot wide from a tight angle.<br><br>United were struggling to create anything of note from open play but they did manage to call Craig Gordon into action for the first time at a set piece in the 17th minute. Ryan McGowan&rsquo;s long throw-in from the right caught the Celtic defence flat-footed and Gordon raced off his line to make a brave save at the feet of John Rankin.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s 28th-minute breakthrough came when United were temporarily down to ten men, Dillon having limped off to have stitches inserted in a shin wound he suffered in a challenge with Van Dijk.<br><br>United&rsquo;s decision to wait for Dillon&rsquo;s return and not make an immediate substitution backfired as they fell behind. Their recast defence were badly out of position when Celtic counter-attacked swiftly after a poor free kick at the other end by Paul Dixon had gone straight to Gordon.<br><br>Stokes broke free on the left and his low cross found Commons in the heart of the penalty area. His initial shot took a slight deflection off Jaroslaw Fojut and was well saved by Cierzniak, the big Pole diving to his left to get a hand to the ball. But Commons reacted quickest to the rebound, ramming home a shot from close range.<br><br>United appeared disorientated and the confusion over Dillon continued when, just as they were about to send Blair Spittal on in his place, the Irish defender re-emerged to return to the action four minutes after the goal had been scored.<br><br>It required a fine save by Cierzniak, diving low to his right, to prevent Commons doubling Celtic&rsquo;s lead with a well struck right-foot shot after a clever turn on the edge of the penalty area. United rallied in the closing stages of the first half and had a penalty claim turned down by referee Bobby Madden when Ryan Dow went down after being nudged off the ball by Scott Brown. It came into the category of &ldquo;soft, but seen them given&rdquo;.<br><br>Dow was the liveliest and likeliest of United&rsquo;s players in the attacking third of the pitch. Just before the interval, he got on the end of another long throw-in from McGowan but his header did not unduly trouble Gordon.<br><br>Mario Bilate, preferred to Henri Anier as the replacement for the suspended Nadir Ciftci in attack for United, toiled to impose himself on proceedings. He did burst into life six minutes into the second half, showing good strength to barrel his way past Van Dijk before getting in a shot which took a deflection off Jason Denayer before being well saved by Gordon low to the goalkeeper&rsquo;s right.<br><br>But United&rsquo;s hopes of building momentum in their search for an equaliser diminished hugely with Dillon&rsquo;s dismissal in the 56th minute. The defender caught Emilio Izaguirre late with a high tackle which, if not malicious, was certainly dangerous and gave referee Madden little option but to reach for his red card. McNamara replaced Bilate with Anier in a bid to give his short-handed side fresh energy for what was now a seriously uphill task.<br><br>United were admirably gutsy in their efforts to retrieve the situation but were unable to seriously trouble the Celtic defence.<br><br>Deila made a double change with just over 20 minutes left, introducing Forrest and John Guidetti for Commons and Griffiths. Their arrival proved effective in stretching United in the closing stages and it was the substitutes who combined to give Celtic the insurance of their second goal in the 79th minute.<br><br>With United caught out by a rapid counter-attack, Guidetti received a pass from Stefan Johansen and laid the ball back into the path of Forrest who drove a firm right-foot shot beyond Cierzniak from around 20 yards.<br><br>The winning margin should have been more emphatic for Celtic but they squandered the opportunity to add gloss to the final scoreline with four minutes remaining. Forrest went down under Dixon&rsquo;s challenge from behind in the box, prompting the referee to immediately point to the spot.<br><br>Forrest and Guidetti became involved in an unseemly argument over who would take the penalty. It was Forrest who prevailed but his confidence was misplaced as he struck a tame effort straight down the middle which Cierzniak saved with some ease.<br><br>Dundee United: Cierzniak, Dillon, Morris, Fojut, Dixon; Paton (Erskine 72), Rankin; McGowan, Butcher, Dow; Bilate (Anier 59).

He eluded a series of challenges, but still ran out of space and support before anything meaningful could occur.<br><br>United were strong, muscular and stoic, while Celtic kept probing for the delicate, subtle pass. They were handed an opening when Griffiths was cute enough to intercept Callum Morris&#39;s pass back, but then from a tight angle could only skew his shot into the side-netting.<br><br>It took misfortune and, perhaps, an element of misjudgement, for United&#39;s good work to be undone.<br>James Forrest pings home Celtic&#39;s second goal 11 minutes from full-time<br><br>James Forrest pings home Celtic&#39;s second goal 11 minutes from full-time<br><br>Dillon suffered what appeared to be a nasty cut from a stud mark after an accidental collision with Van Dijk. He was off the field for two minutes when Celtic scored, with Commons reacting more sharply than Fojut when his shot was parried away by a brilliant Cierzniak save. Pouncing on the rebound, Commons drilled the ball into the net.<br><br>Jackie McNamara was exasperated on the touchline, turning round to yell at his staff while Dillon was still inside the dressing room being treated. The United manager was on the verge of bringing on Blair Spittal - the player was stripped and waiting at the touchline - when Dillon finally reappeared. The damage was done, though, to the scoreline and to United&#39;s best hopes of triumph.<br><br>They felt momentarily aggrieved when, after surging into the penalty area, Dow was nudged in the back by Scott Brown and went to ground, although a penalty would have been a harsh judgement however much United demanded one.<br><br><br>Celtic could rely on more space opening up after the break, with United having to chase an equaliser. Their cause was further enhanced when Dillon was sent off for a straight-legged challenge on Emilio Izaguirre. There didn&#39;t seem any malicious intent, but it was a dangerous enough tackle to merit the dismissal.<br><br>The decision irked McNamara, who was eventually spoken to by the referee Bobby Madden.<br><br>A second goal was inevitable, though. Morris repelled two shots with diving tackles, before Forrest eventually steered the ball into the net from 20 yards. The Celtic substitute was less composed minutes later, when he missed from the penalty spot after being bundled over by Paul Dixon.<br><br>The miss was particularly chastening, since some of his team-mates had wanted him to let John Guidetti take the penalty. The fans chanted for it to be Brown, but at the end of a difficult week for the Celtic captain, he would have taken most satisfaction from lifting the trophy at the end.<br><br>And with his team leading the Scottish Premiership and with a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay with Dundee United to come, Brown will hope to have his hands on more silverware by the end of the season.<br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Dundee United 0, Celtic 2.<br>90:00 +3:18 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Dundee United 0, Celtic 2.<br>90:00 +1:12<br><br>Attempt missed.
