Picture: SNS<br>The league challenge started in Gorgie last August as Brendan Rodgers kicked off with a 2-1 win courtesy of a late debut goal by Sinclair after he had come off the bench.<br>Star strikers Moussa Dembele and Leigh Griffiths were out injured for the return to Edinburgh but the former Manchester City and Aston Villa forward rendered their absence irrelevant with two well-taken goals in three first-half minutes.<br>Midfielder Stuart Armstrong added a third with a drive and Patrick Roberts scored a wonderful fourth before Sinclair notched his third from the spot with seven minutes remaining.<br>It was a championship wrapped up in style for the Hoops, who are unbeaten in 30 league games since the start of the season, winning 28 and drawing two, and the club remain on course for a domestic treble.<br>Hearts had started the game encouragingly enough but could not recover from Sinclair&rsquo;s double-whammy and they remain two points behind fourth-placed St Johnstone.<br>For a fixture which is rarely short of incident and talking points, the first one of the afternoon was the absence of Dembele and Griffiths from the Hoops ranks with respective hamstring and back problems.<br>Both, however, had missed the 4-0 home win over the Jambos at the end of January.<br>Winger Roberts replaced Dembele as the main striker while Hearts also showed one change with midfielder Perry Kitchen taking over from Arnaud Djoum.<br>Celtic midfielder Callum McGregor was offside when he converted a Sinclair pass in the first minute of a typically frantic first half.<br>Hearts striker Esmael Goncalves drew a fine save from former Hearts goalkeeper Craig Gordon in the 10th minute with a powerful drive from the edge of the box, before thwarting the same player minutes later after he had been set up by Jamie Walker.<br>The visitors raced up the other end and McGregor tamely side-footed a pinpoint Sinclair cross past the post from eight yards.<br>Hearts looked the more likely to draw first blood and Gordon had to punch clear a Krystian Nowak header from Walker&rsquo;s corner but a moment of magic in the 24th minute turned the game in Celtic&rsquo;s favour.<br>A classic one-two between Sinclair and Roberts inside the box ended with the former driving high past helpless Jambos goalkeeper Jack Hamilton.<br>Three minutes later Sinclair was released through the middle by Roberts and he raced clear to knock the ball past Hamilton for his fifth goal against Hearts this season and his 20th in total in all competitions.<br>There seemed little belief among those in maroon, summed up early in the second half when striker Bjorn Johnsen blasted a shot high over the bar when he had options.<br>Moments later, at the other end, winger James Forrest&rsquo;s shot was deflected in by Hearts defender Tasos Avlonitis but the offside flag was up.<br>However, there was no mistaking the validity of Armstrong&rsquo;s goal in the 55th minute as the in-form midfielder, who made his Scotland debut against Slovenia last Sunday, drove in from the edge of the box after taking a Kieran Tierney pass.<br>The 1,476 Celtic fans behind the goal stepped their celebrations up further when Roberts curled in number four with his left foot from just inside the box after being slipped in by McGregor.<br>As some of the home fans in the crowd of 16,539 began to drift away, the champions kept pressing for number five.<br>And when Nowak was adjudged by referee Kevin Clancy to have tripped Sinclair inside the box, the Hoops attacker got up and slammed the penalty high past Hamilton to complete a memorable afternoon for him and the rampant visitors.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  BBC<br><br>By Clive Lindsay<br><br>BBC Sport<br><br> 4 hours ago From the section Football <br><br>Celtic&#39;s Scott Sinclair celebrates<br>Scott Sinclair has scored six goals in three games against Hearts<br><br>Celtic clinched a sixth consecutive Scottish title with a flourish as three-goal Scott Sinclair again proved to be a thorn in the flesh of Hearts.<br><br>Brendan Rodgers&#39;

defensive frailties had come home to roost and Armstrong&#39;s 20-yard drive after the break and Roberts&#39; deft chip from the edge of the penalty area ensured the title was on its way back to Glasgow.<br><br>Sinclair completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot after being pulled down by Krystian Nowak.<br><br>What now for Celtic?

The defeat was deemed the worst in Celtic&#39;s history.<br><br> Report: Celtic beat Hearts 5-0 to win Premiership<br> A fitting way to win title, says Rodgers<br> Celtic&#39;s title triumph by numbers<br><br>There were calls, by Celtic&#39;s own supporters, for much of the team to be binned. Joey Barton - then at Rangers - went on Twitter and posted emojis of faces crying tears of laughter and tears of sadness.<br><br>There were GIFs of a slapstick Efe Ambrose, there was thunder and lightning about the ineffectiveness of Scott Brown, who was deemed, by Celtic people, &quot;an embarrassment to the club&quot; and &quot;our worst captain ever&quot;.<br><br>This was not how Rodgers imagined life to be in a job he described as a dream come true.<br>Five key Celtic moments this season as they close in on the Premiership title<br><br>In the chronicling of Celtic&#39;s sixth successive title win there are many landmarks and even though that Red Imps game was in a different competition in a different country, it has its place in the story.<br><br>It showed Rodgers how desperately lax Celtic could become, how a lack of professional pride could dog them in the most extraordinary and humiliating of ways.<br><br>He kept a calm demeanour but that loss was an affront to the values he holds dear - hard work, honesty, bravery.<br>Rapid conversion<br><br>Rodgers tells a story about Dedryck Boyata that cuts to the heart of what he looks for in a player. Boyata was out of the Celtic team and almost a forgotten man. Rodgers had given him things to work on to improve his performance but the centre-half was still nowhere the first team.<br><br>One evening Rodgers had to run a late-night errand to Lennoxtown. It was around midnight when he left. He heard some noise coming from the gym and poked his head around the door. In there on his own, working away, was Boyata. Rodgers knew in that moment that the Belgian was not finished at Celtic. A player with that kind of desire is exactly what the Northern Irishman wants at his club.<br><br>Everything changed under Rodgers - and quickly.<br><br>When Celtic needed a player to step up and convert a penalty in the last minute of a game against Astana that would put them into the final round of Champions League qualification, one of Rodgers&#39; new signings did the job. On his 20th birthday, Moussa Dembele gave the first small sign of what a sensational signing he was going to become, what a coup Rodgers had pulled off in getting him for the trifling sum of &pound;500,000.<br>Moussa Dembele<br>Dembele was signed from Fulham for a modest development fee<br><br>Dembele is on 32 goals for the season and is one of the most talked-about young players in Europe. He is just one feelgood story among several.<br><br>Four days later, on the opening weekend of the league season, Celtic were level at 1-1 after an hour. Rodgers turned to his bench and brought in another of his recruits, Scott Sinclair. With nine minutes left, Sinclair got the winner, an early illustration of what he was going to bring to the table in the months ahead.<br><br>The 28-year-old former Chelsea and Manchester City forward was a busted flush until Rodgers renewed their relationship that had blossomed so well at Swansea. He has got 21 goals.<br>Familiar faces flourish<br><br>Even at that early stage of the campaign, Celtic fans were noticing a difference in their team. Brown was slowly getting back to his combative best, James Forrest was more of a consistent performer than before, Dembele and Sinclair were scoring goals and creating goals, and in late October a new and improved Stuart Armstrong emerged.<br><br>Armstrong had been shunted out on the left side of midfield under Ronny Deila despite everybody telling the manager he needed to play in a central role. His confidence had become shot, his role in the team peripheral.<br><br>Rodgers had not started Armstrong in some key games early in the season - both legs of the Hapoel Beer Sheva tie, the thumping victory over Rangers at Celtic Park, the ill-fated trip to Barcelona, the huge occasion that was the home game with Manchester City, the home game with Borussia Monchengladbach, the League Cup semi-final against Rangers.<br>Stuart Armstrong<br>Armstrong was one of six Celtic players in the Scotland line up for this month&#39;s win over Slovenia<br><br>It was only when Armstrong started, and scored, in the league win against Ross County on 26 October that he got a sustained run in the team. And he was different player. Strong, influential, a creative threat, a leader, a goal-scorer.<br><br>He has 13 goals this season and is now a Scotland international.<br><br>In helping his club, Rodgers is also helping his adopted country, not just in the fantastic renaissance of Armstrong, but in the reinvigoration of Brown and the continuing development of Kieran Tierney, a young player whose future gets brighter by the month.<br>Yawning gap<br><br>Celtic have all the financial advantages, it&#39;s true. They were always going to win the league, that&#39;s obvious.<br><br>Even those who believe in miracles gave up all hope of a title race as early as late October when Celtic held a nine-point advantage over the field. Nine became 13, then 16, then 19.<br><br>This is what they should be doing, of course. But they didn&#39;t do it last season. At this point of the season 12 months ago, Celtic held just a four-point advantage over Aberdeen, albeit with a game in hand. It was only in April that they kicked on and stretched clear.<br><br>This season, Celtic were out of sight even before the marketing people had a notion of dressing-up Leigh Griffiths as a Christmas elf. They&#39;d disappeared over the horizon by the turn of the year.<br>Scott Sinclair celebrates a goal against Rangers<br>Sinclair has had a huge impact in his debut season for the champions<br><br>It&#39;s understandable to downplay Celtic&#39;s domestic dominance, but it&#39;s worthwhile exploring it all the same. We think of them rampaging their way to the title, unbeaten and largely unthreatened. We think of the hammerings they&#39;ve dished out. In league matches they&#39;ve scored four or more goals against eight out of the 11 teams in the Premiership. They got five against Rangers, St Johnstone and Motherwell. They got six against Kilmarnock.<br><br>Easy? Unquestionably. But they&#39;ve had to graft at times. Before this weekend they&#39;d won 27 league games and 12 of them had been by a goal.<br>Mentality of relentlessness<br><br>This cuts to what some rival managers say about the greatest improvement that Rodgers has introduced - hard work and improved fitness.<br><br>They have the talent, but what other managers keep saying is that as much as Dembele and Sinclair and Armstrong and Brown have made them borderline unbeatable domestically, it&#39;s their physical and mental robustness that is the key change.<br><br>As one Premiership manager said recently, &quot;They&#39;re relentless. When they have you on the ropes their hunger to finish you off is greater than it&#39;s been for a long time.&quot;<br><br>That&#39;s backed up by their scoring record. In all competitions, Celtic have scored 28 goals after the 80-minute mark in matches this season.<br>Tom Rogic scored a last-minute winner at Fir Park in early December<br>Tom Rogic scored a last-minute goal in a dramatic 4-3 win at Fir Park in early December<br><br>That playing to the last whistle is down to Rodgers. He&#39;s trying to create a culture that&#39;s not just going to work domestically but internationally. The chants of &#39;Here we go, ten in a row&#39; are all very well to him, but what he wants is not just success at home but growth in Europe - the true testing ground.<br><br>Winning the title was a formality, but it&#39;s how they won it that counts. They&#39;ve found new players and reawakened others.<br><br>It&#39;s not just another league title that Celtic fans are celebrating, it&#39;s the belief that better days lie ahead for this team on a bigger stage, if only they can keep it together and add to it.<br><br>Rodgers is not the type of manager to settle for what he has. A title is always to be cherished, but he&#39;ll see it as just another stop on a much longer journey.<br><br><div class="lx-stream gs-u-box-size gs-t-sport lx-lts--robo-text"><div class="lx-stream__feed"><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at   </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Heart of Midlothian 0, Celtic 5.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+2&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Heart of Midlothian 0, Celtic 5.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 89&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt missed.
