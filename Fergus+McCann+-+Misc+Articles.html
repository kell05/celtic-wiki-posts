The other one is Saddam Hussein!</h3>Daily Record 1998<br><br>Celtic supremo Fergus McCann was yesterday branded &quot;devious, dictatorial and arrogant&quot; by a High Court judge.<br><br>The astonishing personal attack came as Lady Cosgrove ruled on the club&#39;s cash battle with ex- boss Lou Macari.<br><br>She described him as &quot;an amiable man&quot; - but threw out his pounds 430,000 damages claim for unfair dismissal.<br><br>Shattered Macari, who now faces a pounds 250,000 legal bill, said last night: &quot;I can&#39;t believe it.&quot;<br><br>He is now considering an appeal against the ruling.<br><br>The judge also dismissed Celtic&#39;s pounds 250,000 counter claim against Macari.<br><br>However, she had some stinging criticism for Parkhead chief McCann, who spoke for the club at a bitter court hearing.<br><br>Lady   Cosgrove said: &quot;He was frequently reluctant to answer the precise   question posed and I formed the impression of a rather devious   individual.<br><br>&quot;I had the clear impression of an uncompromising and   somewhat arrogant employer who expected unquestioning compliance with   his instructions and unfailing deference to his views.&quot;<br><br>She described his dealings with Macari as &quot;extremely demanding and even dictatorial&quot;.<br><br>The former Celtic striker left Stoke City in October 1993 to take over as Parkhead boss.<br><br>In April 1994, McCann took over at the club - and two months later Macari was out on his ear.<br><br>In   his action at the Court of Session, Macari claimed the club broke his   contract which had a clause in it saying he couldn&#39;t be sacked in the   first year.<br><br>But Celtic said they had couldn&#39;t be sacked in the first year.<br><br>But   Celtic said they had every right to dump him as he refused to move his   home from Stoke to Glasgow, was often an absentee manager and didn&#39;t   provide McCann with weekly reports.<br><br>Lady Cosgrove said she backed Macari&#39;s claim that McCann was out to get him from the outset.<br><br>She   said: &quot;I formed the impression that he clearly would have preferred to   have a manager of his choice as opposed to one who had been appointed  by  the old board.&quot;<br><br>But she added: &quot;Macari, who impressed me as  an  amiable but not particularly astute individual, seemed to appreciate   either the nature of the man who had become his employer or his   methods.&quot;<br><br>She said McCann had invested a lot of his cash and the new board had given him full executive powers.<br><br>So he was entitled to issue orders which Macari had to obey.<br><br>Lady   Cosgrove said: &quot;His approach was that there required to be a sharp   change of emphasis from family tradition to commercial enterprise if   Celtic were to maintain their position as a leading club.<br><br>&quot;It   appears that Macari unfortunately failed to come to terms with the   changing situation and the realisation that the ways of the old board   were not the ways of his new employer.<br><br>&quot;Whether through   understandable anxiety about losing his job or through a stubborn,   rather blinkered belief that the way things had been previously was   right, he forced the issues to the point of confrontation.&quot;<br><br>Lady   Cosgrove said Macari should have moved home to Glasgow and she  described  his excuses for not doing so as &quot;shot through with  contradictions&quot;.<br><br>She said he had devoted himself with all his energies to the job during his short spell at Parkhead.<br><br>But the question was whether McCann had acted reasonably in demanding he spend more time at the club.<br><br>She   said: &quot;The fact Macari insisted on carrying on as he saw fit seems to   me to be a further example of his attitude and of a rather stubborn   refusal to change his ways.<br><br>&quot;His view of himself as a   professional who would not in any circumstances take instructions from   an employer did not allow him to acknowledge the reality of life   embodied in the maxim, `He who pays the piper calls the tune&#39;.&quot;<br><br>Lady Cosgrove&#39;s 83-page judgment ruled Macari was &quot;in clear breach of his contract of employment&quot;.<br><br>But   she rejected Celtic&#39;s claim they were entitled to recover the pounds   250,000 they paid Stoke for Macari as he had broken his contract.<br><br>The club are also facing a pounds 250,000 legal bill, but spokesman Peter McLean said Celtic were &quot;very pleased&quot;.<br><br>However, the only winners in this case were the lawyers - who between them pocketed something like pounds 500,000.<br>COPYRIGHT 1998 Scottish Daily Record &amp; Sunday<br>No portion of this article can be reproduced without the express written permission from the copyright holder.<br>Copyright 1998 Gale, Cengage Learning.

The other two MUST follow before Celtic&#39;s ambition can start to match that of their deadliest rivals at Ibrox.<br><br>The managing director last week called Pierre Van Hooijdonk, Jorg Cadete and Paolo di Canio the Three Amigos.<br><br>Brown, McCann and Venglos had turned into the Three Cowboys. And now the Hole in the Wall Gang has to be disbanded altogether.<br><br>Brown and McCann conspired to botch the appointment of a head coach when they gave the job to Venglos and then left him to get on with proving he wasn&#39;t up to the task he&#39;d been given.<br><br>Brown interfered in team matters in my opinion and Venglos allowed him to buy and sell without giving the coach his place.<br><br>It was the kind of interference which drove Wim Jansen from the club. And Murdo McLeod. And David Hay. And very nearly saw Paul Lambert and Craig Burley take the same route.<br><br>Venglos is cast in the role of victim and does little to put anybody off the idea. But victims don&#39;t get a six figure salary for acting as a puppet.<br><br>Celtic suffered as a direct result of having no central defenders against FC Zurich in their UEFA Cup tie on Tuesday night.<br><br>WHO approved the transfer of Malky Mackay to Norwich City earlier in the season in that case?<br><br>And WHY wasn&#39;t defensive cover bought for him after he&#39;d gone?<br><br>That was managerial incompetence and there was an air of celebration about Celtic Park yesterday in the wake of Brown&#39;s exit.<br><br>There to hear the news of Brown&#39;s farewell was the PR guru who had been asked to privately canvas journalists and discover if the general manager&#39;s image could be reinvented.<br><br>I was one of those asked if the public relations disaster could be given an image makeover.<br><br>The discussions were supposed to be confidential. But I decided to go public on the subject this weekend BEFORE Brown walked.<br><br>Why should I have helped Celtic to secretly make good their mistakes while their fans were enduring a very open humiliation.<br><br>Now Brown has gone. And McCann is going. Venglos would be better off arranging a removal van as well. He will NOT be part of the new Celtic.<br><br>In the meantime I would offer the club&#39;s spin doctors one piece of advice for free.<br><br>A dark cloud started to lift over Celtic Park at one o&#39;clock yesterday afternoon. There is one figure who should now be brought into the place in an ambassadorial capacity.<br><br>The club and supporters need to be reunited to show a sense of being compatible and committed to a single aim. His name is Billy McNeill.<br><br>He shouldn&#39;t pick the team. He shouldn&#39;t negotiate the players&#39; contracts.<br><br>But he should be allowed to help give the club back its integrity and dignity.

Fergus is Celtic&#39;s real saviour after hauling club back from edge of oblivion.     </h3><div> 29 Oct 1999</div>   <div class="p402_premium">  Byline: JAMESTRAYNOR The only Scottish journalist Fergus McCann would speak to  <br><br> FERGUS McCANN doesn&#39;t take strolls down memory lane but he does do the odd whirlwind tour back into a past that will be with him as long as Celtic have a future.  <br><br> He might be a more relaxed and yes, even more humourous man now that six years have passed since he left Parkhead, but even as he and his family blend into Boston where they now live, Celtic will never be left too far behind.  <br><br> McCann rarely returns but he will be in Glasgow next weekend for the unveiling of the Brother Walfrid statue because he believes the club and the fans need to recognise their past. However, he won&#39;t stay long.  <br><br> The team aren&#39;t playing on the Saturday and McCann no longer has immediate family members living in Scotland. So he plans to head back across the Atlantic after the ceremony,anxious to avoid becoming centre stage again.  <br><br> &quot;My time with Celtic,&quot; he says, &quot;is over. Other people are running the club and making good progress and Fergus McCann is what he always was, a supporter.&quot;  <br><br> However,he is a fan with a part of his life wrapped like a vine around Celtic and even though he would dispute the notion, this little man from Croy, who has Canadian citizenship but has set up home in Massachusetts, was one of the club&#39;s major players.  <br><br> Forget Henrik Larsson. The former chairman is more of a Celtic saviour than the Magnificent Seven, even though it was McCann who forged the huge deal that kept Larsson at the club a few years longer.  <br><br> The Swede was a prolific scorer and his game intelligence lifted the team to heights no one could have expected but it was the business brain below the bunnet that led Celtic back from the brink.  <br><br> It was McCann and a few other men who saved Celtic from going under 11 years ago when they faced financial ruin andthebankhadsetadeadlineforclosure. At the time it was thought Celtic had 24 hours, although some now ridicule that belief, claiming it was a figment of an over-excited media Buttheman closest to thelobbyingand backroom manoeuverings claims Celtic were teetering on the brink. &quot;It is not a myth,&quot; he says with that sharp machine-gun delivery of his.  <br><br> &quot;The bank had set a noon deadline and I had to put in my money even though I didn&#39;t have control of the club. But I knew having done that there was no way in the world the directors could continue.  <br><br> &quot;Unfortunately they then exacted payment for their shares which I thought was a bit...well, let&#39;s say the same people who were telling other shareholders the official rate waspounds 2orpounds 3a share and please sell us your shares were then saying we want pounds 300 a share.  <br><br> &quot;The morality of that, among people like Michael Kelly was,I think,something to be despised.&quot;  <br><br> McCann had no time for those who were ousted and yet because he was a supporter he had initially offered Celtic help without much in return, but for reasons known only to themselves the directors turned him down.  <br><br> &quot;I spoke to the club in 1992,&quot; he continues. &quot;Jack McGinn was chairman and I&#39;d sold off my golf tour business so I had a bit of money.  <br><br> &quot;My proposal was to put 12,000 seats at each end of the stadium and have 48,000 standing and that would allow for season- ticket holders but the directors didn&#39;t want that. They said, &#39;Season-ticket holders are trouble.They ask for everything&#39;.  <br><br> &quot;The question the directors always seemed to be asking me was, &#39;When areyou going back to Montreal and I realised they were terrified of change that might threaten their positions.  <br><br> &quot;But I&#39;m glad my proposal wasn&#39;t accepted because it was very generous. I would have been lending money at half interest rate and working for nothing with no say or control.  <br><br> &quot;They just couldn&#39;t take yes for an answer and at the time I didn&#39;t have an agenda to take over Celtic.&quot;  <br><br> McCann then started talking to other businessmen in Glasgow because he was now convinced Celtic had little idea of management or marketing but he added: &quot;Eventually it also became clear integrity wasn&#39;t there either.  <br><br> &quot;I had a plan which would mean I was going to have to put up the majority of the money and be the controlling shareholder or one of the others would have to do it.  <br><br> &quot;I would have been happy to have put in pounds 1million and not have any say but my plan wasn&#39;t supported by everyone who&#39;d said they would back it, so I had to put in more.  <br><br> &quot;My initial project needed pounds 7.2m butI had to make it pounds 9m so what didn&#39;t start as a business decision quickly became one because when you put in two thirds of everything you have it has to be on a business level.&quot;  <br><br> Although there were many obstacles to be overcome as McCann dragged the club towards financial stability,he got there in the end and left withpounds 40m - a sum which still bothers some people.  <br><br> McCann, though, believes everyone had the chance to benefit and says: &quot;I make no apologies for what I did. I wanted to make the club viable and this was not a donation. It was an investment.  <br><br> &quot;I hoped the fans would come in with me because that wasa big part of the plan. It was to make the club public and have supporters as shareholders.  <br><br> &quot;I always felt it could be done because Celtic were not being marketed properly but there were risks and when we were preparing for the share issue everyone told us it was the wrong time.  <br><br> &quot;We had just lost to Raith Rovers in the 1994 League Cup Final and I remember being at Celtic Park before the deadline for the share issue and it was pouring with rain.  <br><br> &quot;I saw all those supporters lined up and I felt then that this thing we were trying to do was going to happen.  <br><br> &quot;I felt a very heavy responsibility. I knew I just couldn&#39;t let these people down.  <br><br> &quot;But when the question of me leaving with a profit comes up I say I didn&#39;t do what I did to make a loss. If that had happened then the fans would have lost,too.&quot;  <br><br> As well as the directors, many others, including players such  as Paolo di Canio, Pierre van Hooijdonk and Jorge Cadete, and the SFA  incurred the wrath of McCann who was infuriated when Celtic had to rent Hampden while Parkhead was being rebuilt. At the time Celtic fans said they would rather have seen investment in the team but McCann&#39;s vision was for a massive, modern ground. &quot;It was important for business reasons,&quot; he says. &quot;But it is now a symbol for us. It dominates the skyline and Celtic&#39;s fans are proud of it.  <br><br> &quot;We even got some support from the City of Glasgow who were kind enough to sell us the air above Janefield Cemetery. That was their contribution.&quot;  <br><br> McCann&#39;s interview, the only one he intends giving, will be shown in full on Setanta Sports tomorrow night after Celtic&#39;s match against Dundee United and it shouldn&#39;t be missed.  <br><br> He talks at length about the importance of Celtic&#39;s charitable work and the fight against bigotry but he also lobs a hand-grenade or two at the SFA. Apart from the Cadete registration fiasco, McCann felt the authorities wronged his club over the Hampden issue and is also critical of the National Stadium.  <br><br> &quot;pounds 64m of public money to make it Glasgow&#39;s third-best stadium,&quot;he says.  <br><br> But he&#39;s far from finished: &quot;Hampden wasn&#39;t a friendly environment for Celtic ... we were not surrounded by friends ... I felt I had to fight the club&#39;s corner.  <br><br> &quot;Larsson&#39;s deal was very rich but he was good value for it ... I had common interests with David Murray but we were also trying to beat each other&#39;s brains out ... the fans booed me but Iunderstand.&quot;</div><h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Tax exile McCann ends Celtic era</h3>Sunday, April 4, 1999 Published at 10:00 GMT 11:00 UK<br>BBC<br><br>Fergus McCann (with arms aloft) rejuvenated Celtic<br><br>It was the end of an era at Celtic on Saturday as Fergus McCann left Parkhead after stepping down as managing director.<br><br>McCann,   who has taken the club from the brink of bankruptcy to the top of the   Scottish game in five years, plans to live in Bermuda as a tax exile.<br>But   as the Canadian-Scottish entrepreneur walked away from Paradise - as   the ground is known by fans - yet another managerial crisis loomed.<br><br>Speculation   has been mounting that team coach Dr Jozef Venglos will quit at the  end  of the season, following the lead of Wim Jansen, from whom he took   over.<br><br>McCann received a standing ovation as he took his seat to watch the champions&#39; 5-0 win over Dundee on Saturday.<br><br>It was in marked contrast to last August when he was jeered as the championship flag was unfurled.<br><br>His   time at Celtic has been marked by a love-hate relationship with the   fans, and within recent months Kenny Dalglish and Simple Minds singer   Jim Kerr launched a move to wrestle control of the club away from him.<br><br>Now the club looks likely to miss out on the Scottish Premiership title to arch-rivals Rangers.<br><br>Slovakian   team coach Dr Venglos said: &quot;I will make a decision in the next 10   days.

Hence the guided tour of Gayfield. Details are a bit  scant as yet but it is believed the American actor has his heart set on  making a movie about a heroic but slightly eccentric figure who saves a  ramshackle Scottish football club from the pit of despair and guides it  to a cup final victory.<br><br>Far be it for me to dish out advice to  the man who once gave advice to Don Corleone but Duvall made a big  mistake when he went looking for inspiration at Gayfield. What he should  have done was what I did yesterday morning and take in the  awe-inspiring view from the centre circle at Parkhead, home of Celtic  FC.<br><br>If Duvall was looking for a ramshackle football club that has  been saved from the pit of despair he need look no further than the  famous Glasgow team. And if he was looking for a role model for the  &#39;saviour&#39; figure he need look no further than the man who made it  happen: Fergus McCann.<br><br>Some time within the next month or so,  McCann will sell off his shares in Celtic and retire to Bermuda to play  golf. His departure will end a five-year tenure as the club&#39;s chief  executive during which he has been ridiculed, abused, booed by his own  supporters and this is the absolutely salient point kept the promises he  made them when he took over the club on March 4, 1994.<br><br>Standing  in the centre circle at the new Parkhead, it is almost impossible to  believe that five years ago the very same ground was a decrepit slum; or  that its owners were just hours from bankruptcy; or that the team that  took the field every week could scarcely beat Arbroath never mind  recapture the glory days when the club challenged for European trophies.<br><br>McCann  bought a majority shareholding in Celtic for &pound;9.4 million. That kind of  money is loose change to the likes of Jack Walker. But for McCann, an  emigre Scot and life-long Celtic supporter who made his money selling  golf holidays in Scotland to North Americans, it represented most of his  lifetime&#39;s earnings. It was a real risk.<br><br>He arrived in Glasgow  from his Canadian home and set about implementing a five-year plan. This  involved wiping out the club&#39;s debt, building a new stadium and  restoring the club&#39;s fortunes on the pitch by winning the Scottish  Premier League as a prelude to becoming a force in Europe again.  Finally, he promised to hand over ownership of the club to the fans.<br><br>Five  years on, the 60,000-seat ground is complete, the debt has gone and the  league has been won. As of this season Celtic are one of the five  best-supported clubs in the world behind Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund,  Inter and Barcelona. They now have 53,000 season-ticket holders  (compared to 7,500 when McCann arrived). Steps have been taken to rid  the club of the last vestiges of sectarian bigotry and return it to its  charitable roots. As promised, the fans will get their chance to buy  McCann&#39;s shareholding when he goes.<br><br>It&#39;s been a remarkable  turn-around. However, what is more remarkable is that a significant  number of Celtic supporters will probably be glad to see McCann  disappear off to Bermuda.<br><br>One reason is that McCann has a  forthright manner in dealing with the prima donna antics of fans&#39;  favourites like Pierre Van Hooijdonk and Paolo Di Canio. It didn&#39;t  endear him to some on the terraces. It scarcely mattered that subsequent  events proved him to be right in both cases.<br><br>But no one apart  from Camilla Parker Bowles has had a worse press than Fergus McCann. For  instance it wasn&#39;t so long ago that he was compared to Saddam Hussein  on the front page of Scotland&#39;s biggest-selling tabloid. McCann&#39;s  friends say he has become immune to the personal abuse but it would be a  shame if such garbage was allowed to obscure his achievements at  Celtic.<br><br>Perhaps Robert Duvall could put the record straight if he ever got round to making Fergus The Movie.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  The man who changed Celtic so radically also had a lighter side </h3><i>(The Herald Oct 2008)</i>   <br>The   Official History of Celtic Football Club weighs in at four DVDs and   more than seven hours.

History&#39; delves into periods of turmoil and gives a   platform to thosewhose contributions to the club are mired in   controversy.<br><br>Michael Kelly, the former director eventually ousted   by Fergus McCann, is allowed his say. Kelly&#39;s arguments defy logic  but,  as a leading protagonist, his inclusion remains justified. So,  too,  that of Jock Brown,who had a short but controversial spell as  general  manager in 1997-98. At one point, Brown rhymes off the  successful 97-98  squad, most of whom arrived at the club during his  time there, before  adding: &quot;Now, don&#39;t mistake me, I&#39;m not taking  credit for that ...&quot;<br><br>It is gold. Comedy gold.<br><br>However, it is the documenting of the McCann era which makes for the most fascinating viewing.<br><br>The   Scots-Canadian emerges as the key figure in the club&#39;s history, along   with Jock Stein and Brother Walfrid. In fact, McCann should be   remembered as an important figure in British football. His five-year   plan was the perfect template for the development of a modern club. He   was first to introduce the season ticket culture on a grand scale, which   proved to be the platform for the club&#39;s prosperous future.<br><br>McCann   recalls: &quot;The stadium had to be rebuilt and peoplewere saying why  don&#39;t  you just buy the players Fergus? We&#39;ll stand in the mud.<br>But the stadium was a tool. We had to have a season-ticket base.<br><br>&quot;Jack   McGinn was saying, We don&#39;t want season-ticket holders, they are   nothing but trouble.&#39;Well, I just couldn&#39;t live with that marketing   philosophy at all.The answer is that you have got to fill the park. The   average crowd was 28,000 and we built a 60,000- seat stadium. How smart   was that?<br>Well, it was the right thing to do.&quot;<br><br>McCann also   pushed through football&#39;s first really successful share flotation. He   did so shortly after the club&#39;s defeat to Raith Rovers in the 1994   Coca-Cola Cup final, hardly the ideal market conditions.<br><br>&quot;I had   many doomsayers saying you won&#39;t raise money from supporters&#39;,&quot; he   recalls. &quot;They will talk a lot but they won&#39;t put their hands in their   pockets&#39;. I remember the night before the deadline I was standing   looking out of the window of my office in the Jock Stein lounge. It was a   Friday night, pouring rain and there were people lined up waiting to   invest before the deadline. It was such a daunting moment that I felt I   can never let these people down&#39;. Twelve thousand fans came up with   cash. No other club has had that happen.&quot;<br><br>That McCann was a visionary is well documented. That he possessed an acerbic wit is less so.<br><br>Andrew   Smith, the former editor of the Celtic View and an entertaining   contributor to &#39;History&#39;, was a witness to many of the millionaire&#39;s   eccentricities. <br><br>Such was McCann&#39;s parsimony that he would   frequently admonish Smith for scoffing toast in the player&#39;s lounge and   even administered a toaster&#39; ban. &quot;No one ever worked with Fergus. You   worked for him,&quot; recalled Smith.<br><br>McCann had a nice turn of  phrase  and Smith, a respected football writer onThe Scotland on Sunday,  has  included some of his favourite McCann quotations in his newbook,  The  Celtic Miscellany&#39;, a splendid stocking filler. Here are some of  his  best lines:<br><br><ul><li>  &quot;The Three Amigos.&quot; </li></ul>On the  big  screen, they were the hapless bandits. To McCann they were Celtic   strikers Pierre van Hooijdonk, Jorge Cadete and Paolo di Canio,who   attempted to extort salary increases by crying to the press that the   club&#39;s owners had reneged on (fictitious) verbal promises to improve   their contracts.   <br><br><ul><li>  &quot;Principles, sir? Sorry, I can&#39;t afford them.&quot; </li></ul>From   George Bernard Shaw&#39;s Pygmalion, McCann scoffingly recited this   whenever it was suggested he occupied the moral high ground by not   giving in to monetary demands.   <br><br><ul><li>  &quot;And all the stars that never were, are parking cars and pumping gas.&quot;</li></ul>The lyric from the Bacharach and David song Do You Know the Way to San Jose,<img height="16" src="http://static.wikifoundry.com/img/ticon/ticon_spacer.png" width="1">which McCann offered as a retort to a press man who asked if he was worried about losing stars&#39; on pre-contract agreements.   <br><br><ul><li>  &quot;The dog barks but the caravan moves.&quot;</li></ul>After   the club&#39;s share issue was an outstanding success, McCann offered the   old Eastern proverb as a retort to critics, chief among them ousted   director Kelly, who predicted it was doomed to fail spectacularly.   <br><br><ul><li>    &quot;Do you believe that stuff the old man was saying the other night at   the Oso Negro about gold changin&#39; a man&#39;s soul so&#39;s he ain&#39;t the sort  of  man as he was before findin&#39; it?&quot;</li></ul>A line from The Treasure of Sierre Madre McCann would recite when despairing at the greed of footballers and their agents.   <br><br>During   the building of the stand on the site of the old Rangers end, the   increased height of the new structure brought complaints from residents   in the council houses behind it.They claimed the stand was causing   interference with their television pictures and demanded compensation.   McCann said he would make a payment to all those who brought their TV   licences up to the club.

If the appointment of Jock Stein as manager in 1965 and the  capture of  the European Cup two years later are, in the context of  achievement on  the field of play, unarguably the high-water marks of  that entire  period, the arrival 10 years ago of Fergus McCann as  owner/managing  director led to ramifications that have been  wider-ranging and certainly  more crucial. <br><br>The Scots-Canadian  millionaire&#39;s first act, to  rescue Celtic from bankruptcy and closure,  would be enough in itself to  mark him as the most influential player  since the earliest days. His  subsequent achievements and legacy led  directly to the team&#39;s present  pre-eminence and to widespread  recognition among business analysts that  Celtic are one of Britain&#39;s  most efficiently run clubs. <br><br>In Frank  Capra&#39;s film It&#39;s A  Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) is  given a fairy-tale  opportunity to see how life in his small town would  be if he had never  been born. A series of misfortunes - including a  decrepit Bedford Falls  in the hands of a plutocrat with its people  impoverished and miserable  - remind him of the enormous contribution he  has made. McCann can  claim a similar distinction. His resolute financial  prudence, forceful  execution of his business plan and refusal to wilt  in the hurricane of  criticism he had to face throughout his five-year  tenure transformed  Celtic Park itself from a midden into a 60,000-seat  palace and his  genius for marketing brought in 53,000 season-ticket  holders. <br><br>Without  McCann, there would have been no renaissance,  no Martin O&#39;Neill as  manager, no Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton, Alan  Thompson or John Hartson  to help lift two championships, with a third on  the way, no run to the  Uefa Cup final last season to confirm Celtic&#39;s  re-emergence as a  credible presence in Europe. <br><br>It was he who  assembled a plc  board of financial heavyweights such as Brian Quinn,  former deputy  governor of the Bank of England, Sir Patrick Sheehy,  ex-chairman of BAT  Industries, and Dermot Desmond, the Irish money  machine. And it was  they who continued his policies and, ultimately,  appointed O&#39;Neill. <br><br>McCann&#39;s  qualities also made him a serious  amount of money, his original &pound;9  million investment making five times  that amount when, as promised, he  sold up at the end of his five-year  scheme. McCann never tried to  conceal his intention to capitalise,  claiming from the moment of  accession that he expected a healthy return.  <br><br>He also knew that,  in the event of failure, he could lose a  substantial percentage -  around half, it was said - of the fortune he  made as an entrepreneur in  the 25 years since he left Scotland for  Canada aged 24. Curiously,  there remain any number of people ready to  paint him as some  fly-by-night who ran off with the club&#39;s money. This  is a failure to  understand how capitalism works. <br><br>But to mention  McCann in the  same breath as Stein, far less to argue that he was more  important to  the club (as opposed to the team) is, to a substantial  number, to  commit sacrilege. The most extraordinary aspect of McCann&#39;s   extraordinary achievements is that he was vilified almost throughout his   time at Parkhead. <br><br>Rangers&#39; predominance, founded on a   willingness to spend untold millions that led to their present economic   difficulties, blinded the majority of fans to the long-term wisdom of   McCann&#39;s policies. They were not helped by a disgracefully hostile   majority in the media, who portrayed the managing director as a   tight-fisted, bumbling, dithering, selfseeking capitalist who knew   nothing of football. <br><br>When some tried to explain why Celtic could   not afford to spend fortunes on players - for example, McCann was in   the process of rebuilding a dilapidated stadium at a cost of &pound;40m - they   were largely ignored. <br><br>The most embarrassing consequence of the   tabloid spin occurred on the day in 1998 that McCann unfurled the  league  championship flag, Celtic having ended Rangers&#39; run of titles at  nine  in May of that year under the managership of Wim Jansen.

Mr McCann, it is time for you to be somewhere   else. Anywhere will do  because Celtic&rsquo;s fans are tired of your   posturing and disgusted by your  parsimony. <br> <br> McCann did give Celtic fresh hope but now his grip is choking the life out of the old club. <br> <br> He should get out and take Jock Brown and Jozef Venglos with him. <br> <br>    As football rushes towards the millennium this trio might just be a    little out of their depth. One is committed to maximising profit,    apparently at the expense of the team&rsquo;s ambitions, another keeps    returning empty- handed from searches for new talent, and the third is a    kindly old uncle figure unable to stand up to the club&rsquo;s masters. <br> <br>    In the beginning McCann&rsquo;s methods seemed quaint, and for a while most    of us made excuses for his confrontational and abrasive style because   he  was unaware of the football business&rsquo;s unwritten rules. <br> <br>    McCann could have adjusted but he hasn&rsquo;t and comes across as a  stubborn   little man who will do it his way no matter what. It&rsquo;s his  train set  and  if he wants to run it right off the rails then so be it.  <br> <br>  If  McCann really were a supporter, someone out of the same  mould as the   thousands of foot soldiers who bought into the dream  almost five years   ago, he would be able to lift his eyes from his  ledgers and see the   damage his refusal to break his pay structure is  causing. <br> <br>   Pretty soon his stock among the rank and file will  be so low he may be   allocated a place in the club&rsquo;s hall of infamy  alongside those directors   who ruled before him. If he is not careful  the mere mention of his  name  in crowded Celtic strongholds, like  Bairds Bar in the Gallowgate,  might  cause a silence to fall over the  places. <br> <br> It would be a  great  pity if it should come to that  but McCann and his disciples  within the  club have only themselves and  their egos to blame. <br> <br>  They behave  as though they and only  they know better and that is an  arrogance which  has alienated each one  of them and which now prevents  the club from  making progress. <br> <br>  Celtic, who lost again on  Saturday, are a  club without trusted  leadership on and off the pitch,  and it is  pointless for McCann to  emerge only occasionally either to  patronise the  fans or to toss  verbal hand grenades in the direction of  the media,  sometimes his own  players, and sundry snipers. It seems  every time he  speaks he makes  more enemies, and Celtic don&rsquo;t need to be  isolated. <br> <br>  Apart  from last season&rsquo;s premier-division  championship win, Celtic have   known only trouble and misery. The last  10 years or so have been   fraught with problems, manufactured mostly  in-house, and the fans are   bewildered and anxious. <br> <br> They want  genuine stability and a   reason still to believe, but under McCann,  whose allies would have the   fans grovelling in appreciation until the  end of time because he   delivered the new stadium, this club has courted  controversy. <br> <br>   How often have we witnessed the managing  director rage at the world  when  he should have been building bridges? <b> These outbursts are not  laudable,  they are laughable and his  stand-alone policy is not bold,  it is  boring. </b><br> <br> Even so, the fans would still be behind him if he had provided a team to take on all-comers. <br> <br>    Yet, Celtic are still waiting for the player who could strike a blow    for them and strengthen their hope of retaining their title. That, Mr    McCann is what is most important to your customers, yet you and your    people have failed miserably to provide. <br> <br> Celtic are still    without a top-quality striker because they will not put themselves into    the big-pay league. It is that simple and it is also where McCann lets    the fans down. <br> <br> Listen to this Fergus and try to take it in.    You insult your club&rsquo;s fans when they are told they don&rsquo;t understand  the   economics of the business or the workings of the transfer market.  And   stop telling them players are too greedy and make enormous  demands. <br> <br>   These are not newly-uncovered secrets, Fergus. The  supporters could   have told you how much would have to be spent to keep  Celtic on top. The   fact is fans don&rsquo;t give a damn about how much  money players want to   grab for themselves and unlike McCann they don&rsquo;t  spend too much time   fretting about the profit margin. <br> <br> No  one is greatly impressed   either that McCann appears to have embarked  on some kind of holy  crusade  to bring football&rsquo;s expenditure under  control, and his season-  ticket  holders would rather have the title  with some debt run up on the   transfer market than no title and no  borrowings. <br> <br> These fans are willing to gamble, and remember they, too, are shareholders. <br> <br>    They still find it difficult to believe Celtic didn&rsquo;t sign    reinforcements during the close season and they are appalled that a    top-class striker has not yet been secured. <br> <br><b> If anything the signing of Lubomir Moravcik at a cut price has merely caused them further embarrassment. </b><br> <br>    If you analyse Celtic&rsquo;s behaviour since the title was won, you come  to   the conclusion this club are guilty of misjudging the mood of the  fans   and also their needs, but McCann is not the only culprit. <br> <br>    Recently Murdo MacLeod, who was Wim Jansen&rsquo;s assistant, suggested  Brown   had come up with a possible signing target, and if the general  manager   now believes he is qualified to do that then Celtic&rsquo;s problems  are  worse  than any of us might have suspected. <br> <br> Brown isn&rsquo;t remotely qualified for such a specialised task. This man&rsquo;s function is to close deals and run a smooth operation. <br> <br> Can we honestly say he has succeeded in his remit? <br> <br>    Enough has been said about the    lawyer-turned-television-commentator-turned- whatever- it-is he and    McCann see him as now, but what are we to make of the good doctor? <br> <br>    He is a charming and thoroughly decent man, but that isn&rsquo;t enough.    Managing either half of the Old Firm requires steel as well as tactical    know-how and I just don&rsquo;t believe Venglos has enough left in his    armoury. <br> <br> He has been successful in the past but he is older now and I fear he is a gentle man out of his time.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Fergus still in business</h3><br>FERGUS McCANN insists strict financial discipline has saved Celtic from turmoil<br><br>Published: 2011-03-08, The Sun<br><br>FERGUS McCANN insists strict financial discipline has saved Celtic from economic turmoil.<br><br>The   former Celtic chief helped save the Hoops from bankruptcy in 1994   before embarking on an ambitious five-year restoration project.<br><br>And,   while McCann was often accused of instilling a &#39;biscuit-tin  mentality&#39;,  he has heaped praise on Peter Lawwell and Co for  implementing a  business model that will not endanger the club.<br><br>He  said: &quot;I have  to give a lot of credit to the excellent board of  directors at Celtic.

He added: &quot;It was a more   public job than I ever expected it to be and some things had to be done   which some people did not like.<br><br>&quot;Nevertheless, on balance I like to think I made a difference and the club was in better shape when I left.<br><br>&quot;I did what I could and I kept my promises which was important and now I just want to see the club continue to improve.<br><br>&quot;It was an intense five years at the club but a lot of good things happened.<br><br>&quot;We   completed a huge construction project with the new stadium and also   undertook a big financial project to broaden the Celtic brand.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m glad I played my part and I&#39;m happier that people now are doing my job better than I did.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m   just a footnote in the grand scheme of things.

Yet  BBC Scotland&rsquo;s  investigation into Rangers&rsquo; monetary meltdown, The Men  Who Sold The  Jerseys, made no reference to the man who can be held, at  least  indirectly, responsible.<br><br>Football law-breaking and the   collapse of the club&rsquo;s financial stability seem to be the consequences   of Rangers using Employee Benefit Trusts (EBTs). And David Murray&rsquo;s   decision to turn to these risky schemes can be traced to the rebirth of   Celtic. Which makes a key player in Rangers&rsquo; downfall none other than   Fergus McCann.<br><br>Simply by getting so much right, McCann caused   Murray to send Rangers down a path which has proved patently so wrong.   McCann was the antithesis of Murray. The Scots-Canadian detested what he   called football&rsquo;s &ldquo;jam tomorrow&rdquo; philosophy of Murray. And, as Rangers   rampaged to nine consecutive titles between 1989 and 1997, for all his   brilliance in rebuilding Celtic, McCann lost the on-field battle.<br><br>By   the summer of 1997 &ndash; year four of McCann&rsquo;s five-year plan &ndash; Celtic  were  still stuck in the shadow of Rangers. Murray made sure of that.  For  much of the 1990s, Rangers had run at a profit. With no challenge  from  across the city, they needed only the occasional luxury such as  Brian  Laudrup and Paul Gascoigne, which they could just about afford.  However,  in order to rack up a historic tenth straight title, Murray  decided  greater investment was required. A Scottish record close-season  spend of  almost &pound;15million was sanctioned. <br><br>A posse of players,  headed up  by Italians Lorenzo Amoruso, Marco Negri and Sergio Porrini,  each of  whom cost around &pound;4m, was added to a proven squad. In  contrast, under  new head coach Wim Jansen, Celtic reconstructed their  entire team with  what they brought in from the sale of prized assets  Pierre van  Hooijdonk, Paolo Di Canio and Jorge Cadete. The modest  &pound;650,000  acquisition of Henrik Larsson was mocked for being much  trumpeted by  general manager Jock Brown.Celtic&rsquo;s efforts were  considered futile. The  Daily Record set out three Rangers teams capable  of winning the league. <br><br>In  the end, Walter Smith&rsquo;s final season  brought no silverware to Ibrox as  McCann&rsquo;s mission was accomplished,  Celtic winning the title and League  Cup. Everything changed. Almost, it  seemed, as an act of vengeance, the  bullish Murray escalated the arms  race and put his club on a path to  self-destruction. With cash  injections from new investors Dave King and  investment firm ENIC  totalling &pound;60m, he recruited Dutch manager Dick  Advocaat and allowed  him to lavish a British record summer spree of  &pound;24.5m on players. But,  even though Murray&rsquo;s credit tap from the Bank of  Scotland was flowing  freely throughout his business empire, he saw the  need to make  efficiency savings&hellip; of the tax variety. For it was in 1998  that  discussions began with Paul Baxendale-Walker over such schemes. <br><br>Moreover,   in that summer, the legacy that McCann would leave Celtic when selling   up his stakeholding the following year was cast in bricks in mortar as   stadium rebuild was completed. With a 60,000 capacity, it ensured a   revenue advantage over Rangers, whose Ibrox home housed 50,000. Only   borrowing or fresh investment could allow Rangers to keep pace.<br><br>EBTs   were a means by which Murray could even up the figures. Ultimately,  the  &pound;47m paid into them between 2001 and 2010 can be implicated in all  sort  of ways in the predicament Rangers now find themselves &ndash; and the   possibility that they could be stripped of 13 trophies won during that   period.<br><br>EBTs allowed them to retain a spending level to compete   with Celtic when the club&rsquo;s bankers halted the easy access to credit   while debts across Murray Group spiralled out of control. It is no   coincidence that the zenith of EBT use came in 2007, when Celtic won the   title, reached the last 16 of the Champions League and posted a &pound;16m   profit. However, these trusts were administered in such a fashion that, a   year later, HMRC hit Rangers with a demand for unpaid back taxes of   &pound;24m. That is the basis for the Rangers appeal, subject to a first-tier   tribunal that has yet to deliver a judgment. It is expected to pass  down  a harsh one that could land the club with a &pound;50m bill.<br><br>Baxendale-Walker  says that EBTs were only a &ldquo;problem [for Rangers] because of how they  implemented the structure&rdquo;. <br><br>Rangers&rsquo;  botch is that in order to fulfil  the discretionary and loan elements  of legal EBTs, they could not lodge  payments made to these trusts in  the playing contracts forwarded to the  SPL and SFA. However, few agents  would accept payments to their players  that were simply verbal  understandings. Hence the fact that, of the 63  Rangers players who are  thought to have had EBTs, the BBC claims 53 had  side letters detailing  payments that were made for contractual  fundamentals such as  appearances and bonuses. SPL and SFA rules state  that all payments made  in respect of a player&rsquo;s playing activities must  be included in the  contracts lodged with these authorities. Essentially,  in seeking to  serve, however dubiously, the tax laws, Rangers were not  able to serve  footballing law.<br><br>It is difficult to see how Rangers  can now  avoid being found to have improperly registered almost half  their  players between 2001 and 2010. In the past, clubs who have been  guilty  of this offence have had their results voided. In Rangers&rsquo; case,  this  would mean their title successes of 2003, 2005, 2009 and 2010 would   have been won unlawfully, and likewise the Scottish Cup victories of   2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009, and the League Cup triumphs of 2002, 2003,   2005, 2007 and 2010. <br><br>That would be a bitter blow. But no more   bitter than the fact that, were it not for the EBT case hanging over   Rangers, Murray would have found a buyer other than a shyster such as   Craig Whyte, and the club would have avoided the descent into   administration and possible oblivion. That man McCann has an awful lot   to answer for.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  McCann you believe it?</h3>When Saturday Comes Fanzine<br>From WSC 116 October 1996.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s Fergus McCann has got big ideas. Problem is they&#39;re almost all bad ones, as Gary Oliver explains<br><br>In the week scientists went loopy over what they believed to be an organism from Mars, Celtic&rsquo;s owner and managing director, Fergus McCann, reminded fans that he is Scottish football&rsquo;s own little green monster &ndash; one that remains extremely hostile to its alien environment.<br><br>Contributing to a Radio Scotland broadcast on the ramifications of the Bosman ruling, McCann outlined his vision for the Scottish League by expounding the most preposterous concept one is ever likely to hear: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see an eight or ten-club league, with interlocking matches against English clubs which count for each league&rsquo;s results.&rdquo;<br><br>Pardon? &ldquo;Scottish teams would play each other, let&rsquo;s say, three times and play each English club once,&rdquo; McCann elucidated. &ldquo;By the same fashion, the English clubs would play each other twice and the Scottish team once. You&rsquo;re adding something to the scene.&rdquo;<br><br>Quite what that something would be, other than offering a gift to satirists, remains undisclosed.<br><br>Fergus McCann&rsquo;s utterances are occasionally whimsical but always profit-driven. Yet initially the slight, aging figure that descended on Glasgow looked an unlikely tycoon: his flat cap and thin moustache (sadly now shorn) evoked a caricature from the Neighbourhood Watch. But it soon became clear that McCann&rsquo;s philosophy owed more to Wall Street&rsquo;s Gordon Gekko than Percy Sugden.<br><br>There is an obvious temptation to regard McCann and his Ibrox counterpart, David Murray, as having hearts sculpted from the same piece of stone. But whereas Murray&rsquo;s unmerciful quest for a European league has &ndash; for Rangers, anyway &ndash; a cold logic, fans are now accustomed to Fergus&rsquo; regular flights of fancy; only a few months ago, for example, he urged the Scottish League to admit a club or two from Ireland.<br><br>But then Fergus McCann&rsquo;s credentials have been in question ever since he, the exiled &lsquo;fan&rsquo;, jetted in from Canada to resume his spat with the club&rsquo;s old board, ignorant that Celtic were to play a cup semi-final the following evening.<br><br>And besides his having a surname other than Kelly or White (the two dynasties who had presided over Celtic&rsquo;s decline), McCann won supporters&rsquo; confidence largely through association with the popular former director Brian Dempsey; yet no sooner had the pair ousted the dynasties than Dempsey fled the scene for reasons never satisfactorily explained.<br><br>McCann&rsquo;s acolytes will no doubt point to Parkhead now being awash with cash following a hugely successful share issue. Yet the club&rsquo;s current valuation in the City merely confirms that, for McCann, Celtic was an investment of the gilt-edged variety.<br><br>His reign has certainly been no exercise in philanthropy: bullish in the afterglow of last year&rsquo;s Scottish Cup success, Tommy Burns urged the chairman through newspapers to accept the reality of the transfer market and speculate on players: the manager, though, was immediately slapped down and forced into a humiliating retraction.<br><br>And McCann, too, has repeatedly fallen foul of authority; his poaching of Kilmarnock&rsquo;s management team brought a &pound;100,000 fine; he erected a temporary stand, relieving supporters of a six-figure sum, without first applying for planning permission and building warrant; and most recently, McCann himself betrayed the Rioch brothers&rsquo; role in Alan Stubbs&rsquo; transfer by thanking the unlicensed agents effusively during the press conference.<br><br>Understandably, those transgressions caused widespread amusement amongst non-believers. But more offensive has been McCann&rsquo;s constant dismissal of those he regards as subsidiary junkies. His commentary on Bosman continued, inevitably, in that vein: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see this give a jolt to some clubs. They&rsquo;ve got to get organized on business lines.&rdquo;<br><br>And Celtic&rsquo;s regeneration is, apparently, the template for all others. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a matter of complaining that Celtic and Rangers are too big,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Did anyone ask that question two years ago when Celtic almost went out of business? We had nothing two years ago.&rdquo; Nothing, that is, except for 30,000 absent fans ready to support a winning team, many of them desperate to bankroll the new regime.<br><br>McCann has sought to soften his and Celtic&rsquo;s image with various limp gestures: a campaign of &lsquo;Bhoys Against Bigotry&rsquo; consisted of little more than players wearing printed T-shirts for a photocall. And just recently, he has taken to inviting groups of homeless to Celtic Park. All very laudable, but the venom McCann continually directs at Scotland&rsquo;s smaller clubs marks him as an unlikely egalitarian.<br><br>And Scotland&rsquo;s Glasgow-obsessed media is invariably receptive to McCann&rsquo;s outpourings; throughout the pre-season, utopians such as David Platt, Ian Wright and Graeme Souness supplied quotes for the tabloids to foment nonsensical debate over whether Rangers and Celtic should quit Scotland for the English Premiership, and if so how they might fare.<br><br>But Fergus McCann is unlikely to be around when seismic change eventually occurs; he is already approaching the midpoint of a reign self-restricted to five years. So, should McCann keep his word, he is due to bid Scottish football farewell just before the millennium.<br><br>And then we&rsquo;re gonna party like it&rsquo;s 1999.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>I couldn&rsquo;t let us go bust ... it would&rsquo;ve been a humiliation</h3>  I couldn&rsquo;t let us go bust ... it would&rsquo;ve been a humiliationThe SunEXCLUSIVE ... McCann talks to SunSportBy DAVID FRIELPublished: 29th May 2013145THE club was hours from extinction &mdash; hurtling towards financial oblivion.The bank was set to pull the plug and shut the door on stricken Celtic.The problems ran so deep that the easy option was to let them go under.But, for once, businessman Fergus McCann let his heart rule his head.Why? For him, liquidation meant humiliation and that&rsquo;s something he couldn&rsquo;t have lived with.So he bailed Celtic out with a big cheque and began rebuilding the club.It&rsquo;s a decision McCann has NEVER regretted.In a rare interview, he told SunSport: &ldquo;The balance sheet turned out to be negative &mdash; insolvent.&ldquo;Other liabilities &mdash; even a big tax claim regarding Paul Elliott &mdash; had to be met.&ldquo;It would&rsquo;ve cost less, and left the previous owners with nothing, to go into liquidation.&ldquo;But it would also be humiliating for Celtic. So we paid all the bills.&rdquo;McCann is Celtic&rsquo;s reluctant hero. There is no stand named after him and he&rsquo;s not immortalised in bronze outside the Parkhead front door.But somewhere down the line, he surely will be.Almost 20 years on from his takeover, McCann&rsquo;s decision to step in and save Celtic looks increasingly like divine intervention.He will be remembered as one of THE leading characters in the 125-year-old Celtic story.Yet he doesn&rsquo;t see himself as a saviour &mdash; he&rsquo;s just happy to have helped the club survive.McCann said: &ldquo;Celtic means the same to me as it does to other fans. I identify with the club and wish to be proud of it.&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all. If in my role I helped in some way to make the regular supporter proud then I am more than satisfied.&ldquo;It was a great privilege to be able to help Celtic.&rdquo;McCann didn&rsquo;t need to get involved in the rescue mission.He could have continued to lead the quiet life in Canada where he&rsquo;d made his fortune.But the Scots businessman hadn&rsquo;t forgotten his roots.A former social convener of the Croy Celtic Supporters&rsquo; Club, he felt compelled to help.For years, the White/Kelly dynasty rejected advances but, with the help of diehard fans and other businessmen, McCann got there in the end.He recalled: &ldquo;While in Canada I kept in touch with Celtic&rsquo;s fortunes. After 1988, I saw the club decline.&ldquo;I felt I could help, and tried to, but got nowhere.&ldquo;But the more I learned of the size of the problem, the more it became clear that my plan made sense. Fortunately I was able to get backers I could count on, like John Keane, whose role was vital.&rdquo;When McCann assumed control, Celtic were going nowhere in a fast-changing football world and hadn&rsquo;t won a trophy in FIVE years.They needed McCann&rsquo;s wealth, vision and business knowledge &mdash; and he came armed with a five-year plan.He put in millions and eventually left with a profit &mdash; but he deserved to after risking a fortune to save Celtic.McCann masterminded a hugely successful fans&rsquo; share issue and rebuilt Parkhead into a 60,000 all-seater stadium.It took four years for Celtic to wrest the title off Rangers as they stopped 10-in-a-row in 1998 &mdash; but it was one of the most pivotal championships.He said: &ldquo;Although many said that relying on supporters to provide more capital in a share issue was a gamble that wouldn&rsquo;t succeed, the fans came through with &pound;10million.&ldquo;It was an exciting time, but a daunting responsibility to take on. I was now responsible to 10,000 shareholders as well.&ldquo;When I set a target of 52,000 season tickets, the support understood and responded.&ldquo;And it took a few years for success on the field to occur.&ldquo;Celtic Park was built with 60,000 seats for a reason &mdash; active supporters who make the commitment to be there to fill it instead of watching TV are the strength of the club.&rdquo;McCann&rsquo;s approach drew criticism at times and managers Lou Macari, Tommy Burns and Wim Jansen all headed for the exit during his reign.The &lsquo;Three Amigos&rsquo; of Jorge Cadete, Paolo Di Canio and Pierre van Hooijdonk also gave him plenty of headaches.In a shameful episode, he was even booed by a section of the Celtic support as he unfurled the title flag in 1998.With Rangers&rsquo; David Murray boasting &lsquo;For every fiver Celtic spend, I&rsquo;ll spend a tenner&rsquo;. McCann was often urged to take more risks.But the penny has now dropped and McCann is revered in the club&rsquo;s history.He said: &ldquo;It was tempting to overspend to compete with others, yes. But I felt strongly that I should never make a deal that I felt was a bad one just to look good at the time.&ldquo;Bad deals always add up to bad results in the end.&rdquo;McCann laid the foundations for a bright future at Celtic.When he sold up and bowed out in 1999, the club was unrecognisable from the mess of five years earlier.And had it not been for McCann, the likes of Martin O&rsquo;Neill, Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon might not have been able to lead Celtic to glory in recent years.He said: &ldquo;When I left Scotland I felt I had done what I could and the foundation was there for the board and management to build on.&ldquo;I have a few regrets, but it is hard to please everyone.&ldquo;While I asked a lot of Celtic&rsquo;s supporters &mdash; and they came through &mdash; the customer is always right.&ldquo;As I often said: &lsquo;When you pay for a ticket you are entitled to criticise and boo. Just keep buying the tickets&rsquo;.&ldquo;My time at Celtic was hectic &mdash; long days, plenty of hassle &mdash; but very rewarding.&ldquo;I think I did, mostly, the right things at the right time and learned from my mistakes.&rdquo;Now in his 70s and living in Boston, McCann runs a successful motor-coach business.But he remains devoted to Celtic and continues to buy four Investor Club season tickets each year. He rarely uses them himself but the club is never far from his thoughts.He said: &ldquo;I am happy to be just a supporter now.&rdquo;<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>Take your seats for success!</h3>The Sun<br>FAMOUS FAN ... McCann and Burns with the Big YinBy DAVID FRIELPublished: 29th May 20139FERGUS McCANN insists Celtic&rsquo;s huge fanbase has never been more important as the club tries to compete against cash-rich Euro rivals.The Hoops saviour revealed his frustration at the megabucks TV deals handed out in other countries &mdash; while the SPL gets by on a pittance.Parkhead was packed out as Celtic stunned Barcelona and Spartak Moscow this season.But McCann insists the only way Celtic can continue to punch above their weight in Europe is if the fans turn out EVERY week.He said: &ldquo;The strength of the support is more important now than ever while the club has to operate in a league with unattractive opposition and a tiny TV contract while the bottom club in the English league receives 20 times the income.&ldquo;Filling Celtic Park against Barcelona or Spartak or Rangers is the easy part.&ldquo;The part that really counts is consistent support at every game at Celtic Park and that will deliver the top-level matches.&ldquo;This gives Celtic an advantage that counts.&ldquo;It makes the park a fortress where any visiting club will face a daunting task.&ldquo;When I saw the Bayern Munich players celebrating a goalless draw after a European game a few years ago I knew &mdash; and the supporters knew &mdash; what was possible.&rdquo;McCann believes the financial gap between Celtic and top European sides will close.But he is adamant fans must always make a contribution to the club &mdash; if the Celtic he now sees guided by Peter Lawwell, right, are to stay successful.He said: &ldquo;Eventually, I believe that environment will change and the huge financial disadvantage compared to big clubs in the major European markets will be overcome.&ldquo;I am sure the management is doing all it can but, again, success will come if the supporters do their part.&ldquo;When I was at Celtic &mdash; before and since too &mdash; if someone told me &lsquo;I am a Celtic supporter&rsquo;, I&rsquo;d answer: &lsquo;How? What support do you provide?&rsquo;&ldquo;My time at the Croy CSC reminds me of the importance of dedicated support.&ldquo;The members knew that their role was vital, especially in the hard times.&ldquo;They had a rule that a bus would always run at the members&rsquo; expense, despite their limited funds.&ldquo;Some games were against poor opposition, standing in bad weather, but being there in numbers was important.&ldquo;And so it still is today.&rdquo;<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>  MY 10 IN A ROW; Why Fergus needs a humility check.</h3>Daily Record<br>DAVID MURRAY has stoked up the passions for Saturday&#39;s Old Firm meeting with a thinly-veiled attack on Celtic owner Fergus McCann.<br><br>Just two days before the second, and potentially crucial, head-to-head of Scottish football&#39;s big two, Murray has made it abundantly clear he has little time for his opposite number at Parkhead.<br><br>He describes McCann as a leader who could have more humility or grace.<br><br>As the Rangers owner prepares to celebrate the 10th anniversary of his Ibrox reign this weekend, he has spoken exclusively to the Record on his years at the top.<br><br>And his blunt comments will crush any hope of the Premier League&#39;s two most powerful influences ever forming a meaningful friendship.<br><br>Murray said: &quot;When Fergus came into Scottish football everyone welcomed him, but I&#39;ve never known him publicly to say well done or to congratulate any of the other clubs for anything they have done.<br><br>&quot;We are working to different agendas, of course, because I don&#39;t intend going anywhere, but all I&#39;d really say about Fergus is that he&#39;s not as good at giving plaudits as he at taking them.<br><br>&quot;Some clubs have done extremely well in building up their grounds during difficult times and the larger clubs should give them some credit for that.

McCann had &shy;clearly recognised the potential for recovery, but it was most tellingly articulated by Len Murray, the &shy;well-known Glasgow lawyer, during an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders when the financial crisis was at its most dangerous.<br><br>Murray told the assembly that the club&rsquo;s debt stood at around &pound;7 million and that its basic value was &pound;20,000; that is, 20,000 ordinary shares at &pound;1 each. &ldquo;No company in the history of business,&rdquo; Murray concluded, &ldquo;has &shy;survived liabilities amounting to three hundred and fifty times its &shy;capital value.&rdquo;<br><br>The lawyer, of course, did not mean that the debt had become unmanageable, but that the club was ludicrously undervalued. This was due to the anachronistic, scandalous regulations of the private limited company, which decreed that shares could only be traded with the blessing of the directors and that board members should have first refusal on any that became available. Most significantly of all, the shares were not allowed to &ldquo;float&rdquo; to their true value, as a result of which directors were able to purchase them for around &pound;3 each.<br><br>They were, naturally, allowed to soar to their proper price when McCann came buying. Bulk holders such as Michael Kelly, Chris White and David Smith commanded around &pound;300 per share, a form of hardball that left McCann understandably resentful over the disappearance into their pockets of funds that could have been used in the resuscitation of the business.<br><br>What mattered most to McCann, however, was that the outdated management of the club had created a mess in which crowds were down to well under 20,000 &ndash; in one or two instances, struggling to reach five figures &ndash; and that the previous regime had insisted on a limit of only 7,000 season tickets, on the preposterous basis that &ldquo;season tickets are more trouble than they&rsquo;re worth&rdquo;.<br><br>It is a measure of the persuasiveness of McCann&rsquo;s personality and his formal business plan that Dermot Desmond, the Irish money machine who had no previous interest in football, should be so readily recruited as a major investor. The two men were introduced by Robert Lee, then a young professional golfer and now a pundit on Sky Television, who told Desmond that &ldquo;there&rsquo;s somebody here I think you should meet&rdquo;.<br><br>In a lengthy conversation in his suite at the Dorchester Hotel in London a couple of years later, Desmond told me that he had taken one look at &shy;McCann&rsquo;s business plan and asked him one question: &ldquo;How much do you want?&rdquo; When he was told that taking &pound;4m worth of stock in the upcoming share issue would be advisable, &shy;Desmond asked a second question: &ldquo;Do you want any more?&rdquo;<br><br>The Irishman added that &ldquo;it was clear from the start that Fergus would make a success of it. There was no way this was going to fail. I told him that if he wanted any further investment down the line, I would be very happy to oblige&rdquo;.<br><br>McCann not only built a new, 60,000-seat stadium, but finished up with 53,000 season-ticket holders, a miracle of marketing that brought full houses to Celtic Park for opposition teams who would, in the past, have lacked the drawing power of a &shy;Christmas cracker magnet.<br><br>The single most significant difference between the commercial naivety of clueless directors that brought Celtic to its knees and the appalling  financial excesses of David Murray that led eventually to Rangers&rsquo; &shy;liquidation is that the latter club was left with little or no scope for recovery. Rangers hit the wall when they &shy;already enjoyed capacity crowds, record season-ticket sales and &shy;maximum annual turnover.<br><br>These details are among a number of reasons why it is impossible to imagine a conversation and a transaction between two possibly life-saving investors in present-day Rangers such as took place between McCann and Desmond 20 years ago.<br><br>Far from thriving on new-found revenue streams, Rangers are haemorrhaging money because they have no credit lines, the need to pay for services and supplies on delivery being the most damaging consequence of their previous actions in leaving creditors seriously disadvantaged.<br><br>Fergus McCann once agreed that &ldquo;it would have been cheaper to go into liquidation, but it would not have been the right thing for Celtic to do&rdquo;. It was a nifty seizure of the moral high ground, but, given his record, he should be credited with the nous also to have realised that, in the long term, administration and liquidation would have been an unacceptably &shy;expensive business.  <br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>Brian Quinn&#39;s praise for Fergus McCann&#39;s legacy  By: Kenny McKay on 02 Mar, 2014 12:01 Celticfc.net</h3>  FORMER Celtic chairman Brian Quinn believes the legacy of Fergus McCann&rsquo;s tenure at Celtic is that the club is now one of the best run in Europe.    Almost 20 years to the day when Fergus breathed new life into Celtic as his takeover, share issue and stadium rebuild changed the face of the club forever, Quinn was back to reflect on the impact.    As a life long Celtic supporter, Quinn jumped at the chance to join the revolution when he became a non-executive Director and vice-chairman of the plc board in March of 1996. He later became chairman.    And as the club marked the 20th anniversary of a defining moment in Celtic&acute;s history, the former chairman was warmly welcomed by the Paradise support ahead of the game with Inverness Caley Thistle.    He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to exaggerate the impact that Fergus had. He transformed the club from one that was behind the game to a club that was up for the game and looking ahead all the time.&quot;    Accepting a warm round of applause, Quinn broke off his address to the crowd to reach into his coat pocket to produce something that would come to symbolise McCann&rsquo;s tenure at the club &ndash; the bunnet.    He continued: &quot;Among all the achievements that Fergus brought to Celtic, I&rsquo;d say that possibly the biggest was the share issue.    &quot;The share issue gave the supporters the chance to be a tangible part of the club and the ground was built by the supporters so they felt like this was their stadium and I thought that this was very important.    &quot;The club is now, in my estimation, one of the best-run clubs in the UK and, in fact, in Europe. It&rsquo;s efficient, properly managed financially, it&acute;s got a forward plan that looks beyond the current season ahead and it has a long-term view as to where the club wants to go. It is a terrific football club.&quot;<br><a class="external" href="http://www.celticfc.net/newsstory?item=5516&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Celticfcnet+%28Celticfc.net%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Celtic Football Club - Brian Quinn&#39;s praise for Fergus McCann&#39;s legacy</a>   <h3>  </h3><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>  Fergus McCann: Man of logic, reluctant saviour of Celtic</h3><a class="external" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37204507" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/37204507</a><br>Aug 2016<br>By Richard Wilson<br><br>BBC Scotland<br><br> 4 hours ago From the section Football <br><br>Fergus McCann with a model of a new Celtic stand<br>Celtic Park was rebuilt during Fergus McCann&#39;s time in charge<br><br>Fergus McCann never did think much of acclaim.

His attachment to the club is entirely emotional - he tells a story of sitting at the back of a meeting while working for Marconi in Canada in 1967 listening to the European Cup final on the BBC World Service - but McCann&#39;s involvement with the club was &quot;logical&quot;.<br><br>He is proud of the way the club is run now, not because of the league titles being accumulated but the clear business sense that prevails.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s so easy for the club to be criticised, as they so often are,&quot; he says. &quot;You can buy short-term success at great cost.<br>Fergus McCann and Tom Boyd unfurl the championship flag in 1998<br>Fergus McCann and Tom Boyd unfurled the championship flag in 1998<br><br>&quot;You go back to the previous coach [Martin O&#39;Neill], who brought in three players at &pound;6m a pop, aged 28.<br><br>&quot;They did well, they got to [the Uefa Cup final in] Seville, fine. But look at the balance sheet - the players are gone, the salaries are way up, we didn&#39;t make any money.&quot;<br><br>The assessment is typical of McCann: hard-headed, rational.<br>Act 1: Rescue<br><br>McCann spent two years talking to the Celtic board about trying to help the club as it struggled financially in the early 1990s. The response was generally &quot;when will you be returning to Montreal, Mr McCann?&quot;.<br><br>So he regrouped, found some willing allies and set about trying to oust some of the board members and instigate &quot;radical change&quot;. With Celtic only hours from bankruptcy and fans campaigning against the board, he made his move, flying to Scotland to pay off the club&#39;s debts and begin the process of taking over.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t have a plan to come to Celtic Park and run the club for five years,&quot; he says. &quot;But it ended up being the formula that had to be applied to make it work.<br><br>&quot;Staying out of bankruptcy was expensive. That would have been the easiest way, as you have seen in the case of the other club in Glasgow [Rangers].<br><br>&quot;I was doing what I thought was logical. I was not donating money - I was investing and I expected to get my money back. I didn&#39;t expect to make a lot of money. I did, but that&#39;s the way it happened.<br><br>&quot;But it was not coming in as a saviour. I had a responsibility to the supporters to make sure their money wasn&#39;t wasted.<br><br>&quot;I put two thirds of my money [he spent &pound;9.5m] into the club. It was the correct thing to do.&quot;<br>Act 2: Building foundations<br><br>McCann never courted publicity or popularity. He surrounded himself with smart executives, directors and advisors, and spent five years trying to balance the club&#39;s ambition with the reality of its situation and financial imperatives.<br><br>He oversaw the rebuilding of Celtic Park, funded in part by a share issue, but also the strengthening of the club&#39;s foundations so that a similar period of turmoil could never happen again. There were obstacles along the way, though, as he found as he sought a successor to the manager, Lou Macari.<br><br>&quot;I was under a lot of pressure to get Tommy Burns in, from board members and others I listened to,&quot; McCann says. &quot;I suppose, looking back, maybe I should just have held firm and got the Dutch coach we were looking at at the time.<br><br>&quot;I hired Tommy Burns, not because he was the best qualified candidate but because the fans would give him time. That was the asset he had.<br>Tommy Burns and Fergus McCann<br>Tommy Burns was not Fergus McCann&#39;s preferred choice as manager<br><br>&quot;When I came in and Tommy Burns applies for the job, I go to meet him. But I got fined [&pound;100,000] for the approach. The previous highest fine for a similar situation was &pound;5k.<br><br>&quot;Tommy Burns&#39; salary with one year to go at Kilmarnock was &pound;40k. I felt [the fine] was vindictive and unnecessary and excessive.<br><br>&quot;[Celtic] are not entirely surrounded by friends. The Scottish environment is such that there has been some prejudice against immigrants.<br><br>&quot;Celtic is seen as having a big Catholic population among its support. Celtic supporters understand that Celtic is a symbol of their dealing with that by not being second to anyone.&quot;<br>Act 3: Moving on<br><br>McCann sold up in 1999, making a healthy profit. He returned to Canada and a life away from the public eye.<br><br>He was booed by some Celtic fans when he unfurled the league title flag that summer but has since returned to glorious acclaim from supporters who have a different perspective now on his application of sound business principles ahead of rampant ambition.<br><br>McCann continues to follow Celtic, to understand their place in the game but also to hold views that would radicalise, and enrage, parts of Scottish football.<br><br>&quot;All the small clubs hate Celtic and Rangers, who basically feed them,&quot; he says. &quot;It comes down to human nature, but it also speaks to the structure in Scottish football.<br>Rangers chairman David Murray and Fergus McCann<br>Fergus McCann believes Scotland&#39;s other clubs dislike Celtic and Rangers<br><br>&quot;A lot of things have changed in 30 years: television habits, media, salaries, worldwide brands, Champions League, all these new things. In Scotland, not much has changed.<br><br>&quot;They fiddle around with deck chairs, but you have still got 42 supposed-to-be-professional clubs in a population of five million.<br><br>&quot;There are five million people in Greater Manchester, who have only got two clubs.
