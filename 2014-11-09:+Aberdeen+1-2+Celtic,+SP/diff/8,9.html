The last one of the great league cup winning side of 1957. Scorer of the first goal in the game. RIP  </li><li>Back to the league after UEFA cup match in midweek.<br></li><li>Celtic top of the table with game in hand.<br></li><li>Tensions a little higher than the norm due to the on going case of the alleged racial abuse by Tonev against an Aberdeen player. Celtic deny it, Aberdeen back their player. SFA ruled against Tonev, but Celtic appealing it. Unpleasant situation. However what&#39;s the proof? If no proof then innocent till proven otherwise. More to run on this sorry story.</li><li>Celtic fans singing &quot;you&#39;re bunch of tory *****-bags&quot; or &quot;your&#39;e just a bunch of tories&quot; for Aberdeen voting &quot;No&quot; in the Referendum! <br></li><li>VVD scores his first league goal of the season to win the game with some great footwork back heeling the ball from a corner kick into him in the box. Late late winner.<br></li><li>Deila very much pleased and really showed his emotions at the final whistle going to the support. Quite a show of support from the players today.</li><ul><li>&ldquo;It was orgasmic, if I can say that.Maybe even better than  that! I am very proud of the team. To celebrate today with the players  and the fans was fantastic.&rdquo; - Ronnie Deila after the last gasp 2-1 win over Aberdeen finally took Celtic to the top of the table (Nov 2014)</li><li>Birth of the <a href="/page/Ronny+Roar" target="_self">Ronny Roar</a>!<br></li></ul><li>Aberdeen&#39;s Shay Logan has just been red carded in the refs dressing room for foul &amp; abusive language (post-match). Note: Shay Logan was the player who claimed that Tonev had racially abused him in the last match between the two.<br></li><li>Scott Brown sent off during the match.<br></li><li>Poppy day with the usual mock outrage. Problem is that this year is the 100th anniversary of the first world war. Minute silence held in respect to it. No poppy on the Celtic Jersey. Celtic made charitable donation to poppy charity. Supposedly sets of Celtic fans remained outside the ground whilst the minute silence was conducted.<br></li><li>Various other clubs holding excessive military shows prior to matches, quite ridiculous. <br></li><li>Press still wetting themselves over the forthcoming match v Sevco. <br></li><li>Guidetti says in interview could stay even with pay cut. Bless him! <br></li><li>Internationals next week with Scotland v Ireland or Strachan v Martin O&#39;Neil (battle of the ex Celt managers). Following is a pointless Scotland v England friendly. Both Internationals at Celtic Park as Hampden is still being reconstructued following the Commonwealth games.</li><li>Proud day for Celtic&#39;s Girls academy as both the 15s and 13s lift their respective Scottish Cups</li></ul>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Review<img align="right" alt="aberdeen 1 celtic 2" height="346" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/337c7baa90fd37301be2e0eca73d3a6e/GW312H346" title="aberdeen 1 celtic 2" width="312"></h3>(elsalton of KDS)<br>A fine result in the end, but you have to say we were below par for a lot of the game.<br><br>We  never played at all for the first half hour and only woke up when they  scored, Johansen was our best player in that first half by a mile and  scored a good goal.<br><br>Second half, despite our dominance of possession, we were creating nothing until Virgil bailed us out.<br><br>After our Euro travels and taking the opposition into account it was a satisfactory three points.<br><br>As  for the so called contentious issues leading to our goals, why has no  pundit come out and said that Browns sending off was harsh ?<br><br>He never touched McGinn for that second yellow.<br><br>Nice to hear McInnes whingeing on Radio Scotland, GIRUY Derek.<br><br>Good to see some team spirit at the end in front of the fans, and pleased for Ronny. 						 						 						 					<br><br>(caltonbhoy1967 of KDS)<br><br>&quot;Ten Men Win The &quot;Autumn League&quot;&quot; - copyright Mourinho. <br><br>  Near three hour drive back down the road which I was not looking  forward to turned out to be so sweet thanks to VVD - Amazing what  scudding the Sheep in Sheepsville against the odds can do. <br><br>Anyways ---<br><br>Roon ye and girfuy McInnes you are a  self serving wee snivelling inbred hun mutant  <img alt=":carrot:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/00f15da6e773cf3ceb6dae49f7136d3c" title=":carrot:">  - Hope your sunbed machine blows up on ye just to really feck up your weekend - Greetin&#39; faced priick that you are. <br><br>Roon ye Sheep players especially Robson and McGinn and your support.<br><br>Logan - What about your dignity? <img alt=":ffs:" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/91d37dad4ff1ae5031e0016e3586c1ae" title=":ffs:"><br><br>Muir - Robson must have naughty pics of you with some bint you don&#39;t want your missus to see - Htf he stayed on the park!!!<br><br>Matthews  - By feck for whatever reason you have regressed badly.

towards Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan.<br><br>Celtic submitted their appeal on Wednesday and manager Ronny Deila and skipper Brown upset Dons boss Derek McInnes with the strength of their proclamations protesting Tonev&#39;s innocence.<br><br>Tonev was left out of the Celtic squad though and the issue then proved peripheral until the second half, when Logan was playing on the side of the stadium holding the Celtic fans, who jeered him when he got the ball.<br><br>The home fans responded with their vocal backing, just as they had sung his name before the game, moments before the scheduled minute&#39;s silence.<br><br>There was not even a second of silence though as some Celtic fans shouted and sang, both inside and outside Pittodrie, while others tried to shout them down.<br><br>The controversy continued into the game with a major flashpoint after two minutes.<br><br>Brown appeared to push Peter Pawlett over on the threshold of the box as he chased the Aberdeen midfielder but referee Alan Muir waved play on.<br><br>Aberdeen lost Willo Flood to a hamstring injury inside nine minutes with Barry Robson coming on. Celtic had made five changes with James Forrest among those coming in for his first appearance for almost two months following a hamstring injury.<br><br>There were nearly 20 minutes gone before either side had a meaningful effort, Anthony Stokes steering a first-time effort just past the far post following a sharp passing move.<br><br>The lack of goalmouth action continued until Zaluska failed to claim Andrew Considine&#39;s long throw under pressure from Rooney inside his six-yard box.<br><br>The ball was only half-cleared to Considine who drove it towards goal. Zaluska got down to stop it but could not hold and Rooney was on hand to force the rebound inside the post despite attempts to stop him from the Pole and several defenders.<br><br>Van Dijk had a header saved and Celtic levelled after Charlie Mulgrew&#39;s halfway-line challenge on McGinn sparked a quick break.<br><br>Stokes slipped a pass through to Johansen and the Norwegian slid to reach the ball and wrapped his foot around it to flick it into the net despite Reynolds and his goalkeeper appearing to have the situation under control.<br><br>The Norwegian almost emulated his midweek long-range strike in Romania moments later but Brown got down well to stop his powerful first-time effort from 25 yards.<br><br>The Aberdeen goalkeeper stopped a shot from his namesake early in the second half and McGinn three times came close for the hosts, shooting inches over from 25 yards before hitting the outside of the post from closer in and then heading wide from 12 yards.<br><br>The game grew increasingly hostile. Stokes received a yellow card following an exchange with the home support after he kicked the ball into the crowd, Emilio Izaguirre and Jonny Hayes were booked after the Celtic left-back reacted angrily to a challenge, and Celtic&#39;s Brown was cautioned for the latest in a series of fouls on Pawlett.<br><br>Logan almost helped silence the visiting crowd when he helped set up Ryan Jack via McGinn but Zaluska stopped the midfielder&#39;s header.<br><br>Brown got his second yellow card for taking down McGinn, who curled the resulting free-kick just over.<br><br>However, van Dijk stunned the home crowd in the final minute and Zaluska saved from McGinn in injury-time.  <br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3><br> Celtic go top of the league<br> Virgil van Dijk nets winner on 90 minutes<br> Celtic skipper Scott Brown sent off<br> Aberdeen&#39;s Shaleum Logan red carded after game<br> Dons took lead with Adam Rooney strike<br><br>Ten-man Celtic came from behind with a late Virgil van Dijk goal at Pittodrie to move top of the Premiership for the first time this season.<br><br>The defender applied a deft touch from a 90th-minute corner after skipper Scott Brown had been sent off.<br><br>Adam Rooney had shot Aberdeen ahead, rifling in from close range after a fumble from Lukasz Zaluska.<br><br>Stefan Johansen then took advantage of some hesitant defending to level with a clever finish on the slide.<br><br>Defeat is tough on the Dons, who created the better chances in a fiery encounter and had Shaleum Logan shown a red card after full-time for comments aimed at a match official.<br><br>But the home side were guilty of dreadful marking from the corner that led to the winning goal.<br><br>Former Celtic midfielder Niall McGinn had four good glimpses of goal in the second half, slamming a shot against the base of the post and drilling an effort straight at Zaluska in stoppage-time.<br>Shaleum Logan was sent off for comments made after the full-time whistle<br><br>Shaleum Logan was sent off for comments made after the full-time whistle<br><br>Roared on by a crowd of 19,051, neither side looked content to settle for a point when Brown was shown his second yellow card for a tug on McGinn with eight minutes remaining.<br><br>And Celtic&#39;s positive attitude was rewarded when Van Dijk knocked the ball in at the back post from Johansen&#39;s delivery.<br><br>Pittodrie was the scene of Celtic&#39;s only league defeat last season and Rooney had the home fans dreaming of another success when he knocked in his 13th goal of this campaign.<br><br>Zaluska failed to gather a low shot from Andrew Considine and the striker scrambled the ball in from eight yards, with the keeper unable to recover.<br><br>However, Celtic were on level terms before the interval when Anthony Stokes cut in from left to slip a pass through for Johansen to chase into the penalty area.<br><br>Covering defender Mark Reynolds appeared to have the situation under control but was caught napping as the Norwegian midfielder slid in to lift the ball over the diving Scott Brown and angle the ball into the opposite corner.<br><br>Brown then needed to look sharp to push away a fierce strike from Johansen.<br><br>Aberdeen switched McGinn to the left flank in the second half and the tactic caused Celtic problems, with the Northern Ireland international a threat when he cut inside.<br><br>He sent a powerful strike narrowly over before hitting the woodwork, while a header from Ryan Jack was pushed away in flamboyant fashion by Zaluska.<br><br>Brown&#39;s first caution was for a barge on Peter Pawlett deep in the opposition half and the Scotland captain was dismissed by referee Alan Muir as he impeded another attacking thrust from McGinn.<br><br>The Dons midfielder fired the resultant free-kick over from 22 yards and had one last chance to get on the scoresheet following Van Dijk&#39;s goal, but Zaluska was right behind his shot.<br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Aberdeen 1, Celtic 2.<br>90:00 +3:19 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Aberdeen 1, Celtic 2.<br>90:00 +1:55<br><br>Foul by Andrew Considine (Aberdeen).<br>90:00 +1:55<br><br>John Guidetti (Celtic) wins a free kick in the defensive half.<br>90:00 +0:40<br><br>Attempt saved.

We&#39;re doing well in Europe, we&#39;re still in both cups and now top of the league. That sounds good to me.&quot;<br><br>Deila repaid the compliment, describing his compatriot&#39;s recent form as &quot;unbelievable&quot;, adding: &quot;He is a leader and that&#39;s what we need.&quot;<br>Celtic won 2-1 at Aberdeen<br><br>Celtic are top of the league on goal difference from Inverness CT<br><br>Brown was cautioned for a barge on Peter Pawlett and a tug on Niall McGinn, with Deila saying the sending off was &quot;maybe okay&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It was a tough game for the referee, there were a lot of challenges and the pitch was not perfect,&quot; he explained.<br><br>&quot;We didn&#39;t get the tempo in our play.

He also travelled to Romania for Celtic&#39;s 1-1 draw in the Europa League against Astra Giurgiu, but did not feature.<br><br>McInnes said he will have no qualms about playing Logan in Sunday&#39;s Premiership encounter with Celtic at Pittodrie.<br>Derek McInnes, Aberdeen manager<br><br>&quot;We thought it had been dealt with - he was found guilty of an offence - we felt Shay was vindicated with that and we support him wholeheartedly&quot;<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ve got to remind ourselves that Shay was the one that had the offence put on him and that can sometimes be forgotten,&quot; said McInnes.<br><br>&quot;We can&#39;t decide or dictate what Celtic do, but from my point of view Shay&#39;s performances have been good since the last Celtic game - he&#39;s been excellent - so he&#39;ll be fine.<br><br>&quot;I have total trust that he&#39;ll come in and give us his usual solid performance. I just want to remind people again that Shay is totally innocent in all of this.<br><br>&quot;We feel as though we&#39;re trying to draw a line under it but while there&#39;s an appeal that can&#39;t be the case.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;re eager to get it finalised and dealt with. We thought it had been dealt with - he was found guilty of an offence - we felt Shay was vindicated with that and we support him wholeheartedly.
