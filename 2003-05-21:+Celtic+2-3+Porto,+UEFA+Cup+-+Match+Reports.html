Having reflected on all that the club have achieved and the ambitions they nurse, Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s team must now narrow their thoughts and train all concentration on a Porto side whom the club president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa calls the best in 50 years.<br><br>By implication, Porto surpass even their European Cup-winning line-up of 1987. Tonight&#39;s game on a discoloured, rutted surface at the Estadio Olimpico could make even greater demands of Celtic than their meetings in the tournament with Celta Vigo, Stuttgart or Liverpool. There is a frisson along with the fear.<br><br>Celtic are challenged to square up to their own history and the nature of the reaction will be fascinating. It was this club, in 1967, that established Scotland as the smallest country ever to boast European Cup winners when they beat Internazionale. No one presently on the books could remain in ignorance of that.<br><br>&quot;We have in our midst someone who actually wore the Celtic top in 1967,&quot; O&#39;Neill said of John Clark, the kit man who was then the team&#39;s centre-half. &quot;We are aware of the fantastic history the club possesses, but now it is up to us to do something for ourselves. The thing is to embrace history - don&#39;t be frightened of it.<br><br>&quot;All we can aspire to is to emulate the great Celtic teams. We&#39;ve got some terrifically gifted players and the spirit is similar to 1967. Whether that&#39;s enough to win the game is another matter.&quot;<br><br>O&#39;Neill wavers between a superstitious dread that expressions of confidence will be punished and a realisation that Liverpool would &quot;feel strong&quot; if they had survived to face Porto. He sidles towards the logical conclusion that Celtic, victors at Anfield, should be as sure of themselves but then shies away from the claim.<br><br>The manager was calm yesterday, but the kick-off will still be a relief. With the goodwill fax from the prime minister thoroughly studied by everyone, there is nothing left to do until then. Both line-ups are missing a forward, with Helder Postiga suspended for Porto and Celtic&#39;s John Hartson ruled out with a slipped disc. Otherwise, it is preferences rather than fitness tests which will shape the sides.<br><br>O&#39;Neill may well pick the 11 players who were swamped 3-0 by Porto in the autumn of 2001 in a Champions League away match. Then, the Portuguese club employed three forwards who stretched and overran a trio of centre-backs. Although Celtic sometimes switch to a back four, the same tactical patterns may be employed tonight, with O&#39;Neill believing that his side, now better versed in European football, will engineer a different outcome.<br><br>Porto, 4-1 victors over Lazio in the semi-final, appear to be on the rise. Jose Mourinho, once Sir Bobby Robson&#39;s interpreter at Sporting Lisbon and eventually part of his coaching staff at Barcelona, has been in charge for a little over a year, sweeping them to the Portuguese title and a place in next month&#39;s cup final.<br><br>His side have a fluid style, with the Brazilian-born Deco to guarantee flair and Derlei, the leading scorer in this competition with a total of 10, to make the build-up count. Celtic, of course, have Henrik Larsson, who has already hit the net nine times in the Uefa Cup and is on the verge of his 200th goal for the club.<br><br>Before launching attacks, however, Celtic will wish to establish themselves in an expected temperature of 30C (86F) at the kick-off at 8.45pm local time. &quot;Because of the heat we may have to start carefully,&quot; O&#39;Neill said. &quot;There may be a cagey opening to the game but at some stage you have to come out and express yourselves if you want to win, and that&#39;s what we&#39;ll try and do.&quot;<br><br>Although O&#39;Neill recalls the debilitating Spanish heat when he played with Northern Ireland in the 1982 World Cup, he can trust that the modern preparation of footballers makes them better able to withstand it. The climate is a worry even to Porto, who have been training at midday in Oporto to ready themselves.<br><br>&quot;I assume common sense will prevail here and bottles of water will be available all through the game, especially during stoppages in play,&quot; O&#39;Neill said. Other factors may also have an influence, with the clubs requesting that a bad surface be mowed and watered today. &quot;The conditions are not ideal for players who have dozens and dozens of games in their legs already,&quot; Mourinho said.<br><br>Victory must go to the side who can raise themselves and find a performance beyond all others.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>   Porto boss: Celtic deserve to win Uefa final</h3>  Staff and agencies<br> guardian.co.uk, Monday 28 April 2003 11.28 BST<br><br>Porto coach Jose Mourinho believes Celtic deserve to win the Uefa Cup after their thrilling route to the final in Seville.<br><br>He watched Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s men beat Rangers at Ibrox yesterday to throw the Bank of Scotland Premier League championship race wide open.<br><br>Mourinho was impressed with Celtic&#39;s performance and their tough journey to the May 21 final after seeing off Blackburn, Celta Vigo, Stuttgart, Liverpool and then their fierce city rivals Boavista.<br><br>&quot;It will be great if Porto win and I will be very happy, but maybe if Celtic win it will be because they deserve it,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;The way in which they got to the final by beating Blackburn, Celta Vigo and Stuttgart made it much more difficult for them to arrive in the final than Porto.<br><br>&quot;I think it is a wonderful moment for everybody and for Celtic and we would want the final to be played tomorrow and not the 21st if that was possible.<br><br>&quot;It would have been a bit of history for the people of Portugal if Porto and Boavista had played in the Uefa Cup final, but in terms of football and international atmosphere it is much better to play the final against Celtic.<br><br>&quot;I believe there will be an invasion of Spain by the Scottish and Portuguese people.<br><br>&quot;We want to win, Celtic will have the same feeling as us. We will play a very good final - a quality, quality final.&quot;<br><br>But the Porto boss feels his side will be too strong for the Glasgow giants.<br><br>The Portuguese team crushed Celtic 3-0 the last time the sides met during the Champions League in the 2001/2002, but Mourinho points out that a lot has changed at the club since then.<br><br>&quot;That was not my Porto,&quot; he said. &quot;I have to believe my Porto are better.<br><br>&quot;Our team has changed a lot since then with 14 new players coming in and the team that Celtic played against has maybe only Deco and Jorge Costa still in it.<br><br>&quot;This is a completely new team with players without a lot of international experience who have come from small clubs in Porto.<br><br>&quot;They are full of motivation, confidence and a desire to play at a high level.&quot;<br><br>Mourinho will switch his attentions towards the Portuguese title before Celtic will come back into his thoughts.<br><br>&quot;We have to wait and before that we have to play and win other matches so I can&#39;t concentrate too much on Celtic and forget what I have to do in the Portuguese league,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;This is my only chance to come here and see Celtic because after this there are a lot of fixtures, but I wanted to see and analyse the team, then I will forget about it until maybe the 18th or the 19th of May.&quot;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>   <h3>  Celtic 2-3 FC Porto: FT Report</h3><h3><b>ESPN</b><br></h3><font size="-0"><br></font>Celtic&#39;s  dreams of tasting European glory again came to an end in Seville as  Porto triumphed 3-2 in an epic and exhausting UEFA Cup final. <br><br>Brazilian  striker Derlei&#39;s strike in the 24th minute of extra-time ended the  resistance of 10-man Celtic, who put a glorious struggle against their  Portuguese opponents, for whom Nuno Valente was dismissed in the final  minute. <br><br>Porto twice went in front, through Derlei and Dmitri  Alenichev, but twice Henrik Larsson headed the Glasgow side level to  take the match into extra-time. <br><br>Bobo Balde&#39;s dismissal made  matters difficult for Martin O&#39;Neill&#39;s tired side in the extra period,  and though the 10 men put in a magnificent effort, they finally had to  accept defeat. <br><br>By the final whistle, after a thriller of a  second half and despite the result, there can have been no regrets. <br><br>Of  the estimated 80,000 Celtic fans who had launched the most good-natured  of invasions of Andalucia, only around 35,000 made it into the Estadio  Olimpico for the match. Even so, they still outnumbered the  blue-and-white clad Porto supporters by two to one. <br><br>Whatever the  result, this was always going to a memorable night for Celtic, though  it ended in tears of despair rather than jubilation. Perhaps never  before has a match been so transformed by fans alone from mere a game of  football into a national event. <br><br>Before kick-off, the stifling  heat looked to be Celtic&#39;s chief foe, with temperatures hovering around  the 90 degree Fahrenheit mark. Perhaps it was the tropical climate,  perhaps just the sheer weight of expectation, but the Celtic players  looked tense from the start while Porto appeared assured. <br><br>With  Deco looking lively, Joos Valgaeren had his hands full, and it was the  Belgian&#39;s foul on Porto&#39;s playmaker which created the first opportunity  of the game. <br><br>Deco&#39;s free-kick was blocked by Neil Lennon, but  the rebound was struck first-time and low by Maniche, bringing a good  save out of Rab Douglas. <br><br>Celtic forced themselves into the fray  and conjured up a shooting chance for Stilian Petrov 30 yards out, but  he miskicked his volley. <br><br>Deco, turning theatrical tumbles into  an art form, won another couple of free-kicks, striking the wall himself  first then making way for Valente to shoot straight at Rob Douglas. <br><br>Larsson,  taking a leaf out of Deco&#39;s book, fell spectacularly under Jorge  Costa&#39;s tackle and then whipped in a fierce free-kick which tested Vitor  Baia to the full. <br><br>Derlei scuffed a shot into Douglas&#39; hands,  but with half-an-hour gone O&#39;Neill would have been pleased his side  restricted the Portuguese to a minimum of chances from open play. <br><br>His  only worry perhaps was that the Hoops had been even less creative,  though that changed when Larsson opened up Porto down the right and  Didier Agathe bent over a wicked cross which only just missed Chris  Sutton&#39;s head. <br><br>Agathe tried again, picking out Sutton who  flicked on and this time it was Larsson within inches of making a vital  connection. <br><br>Lennon hacked clear after Alenichev&#39;s ball in  ricocheted around the box, then Douglas pulled off a brilliant block to  deny Deco after he burst past Valgaeren onto Maniche&#39;s pass. <br><br>On  the stroke of the interval, Celtic&#39;s hopes took a real turn for the  worse when they conceded a goal at the worst possible time. <br><br>Alenichev  was allowed far too much space on the left to pick up Deco&#39;s cross, and  although Douglas once again pulled off a superb stop, he could do  nothing to stop Derlei ramming home the loose ball from close range to  spark wild scenes of Porto celebration. <br><br>Ill-feeling between the  teams broke out at the half-time whistle as Agathe&#39;s frustration boiled  over, but O&#39;Neill will have been more concerned with changing a system  which had allowed Porto to pull apart Celtic&#39;s defensive tactics and  left Larsson and Sutton isolated. <br><br>Maybe the streaker who  appeared just before the second half began and ran off dribbling the  match ball - he tried and failed to beat Baia from 12 yards - eased the  tension. <br><br>Whatever the reason, within two minutes of the re-start  Larsson had levelled matters. <br><br>Agathe outpaced Valente and  crossed to the far-post for the Swedish striker to leap above Ricardo  Costa and direct a perfectly-aimed header over Baia, the ball dropping  into the net off the upright. <br><br>Not a bad time to score your 200th  goal, and his equaliser was followed by an incredible crescendo of  noise, though it did not take long for that to die out. <br><br>Deco was  the architect, a swift turn earning him space before a delicious pass  inside the defender allowed Alenichev to drive the ball low past  Douglas. <br><br>A couple of minutes later and Larsson did it again. <br><br>Thompson  swung over a corner and the Swede, completely unmarked, powered in a  header from six yards out to make it 2-2. <br><br>Paulo Ferreira showed  Porto&#39;s threat remained when he sent a scorching shot whistling past an  upright, Derlei stung Douglas&#39; fingers from 25 yards, then just before  extra-time Alenichev fired just wide. <br><br>Into extra-time and the  prospect of a `silver goal&#39; - but Celtic looked on their last legs. <br><br>The  fatigue showed when Balde&#39;s tired, but crude lunge on Derlei earned him  a second caution and so a red card. <br><br>Sutton found some strength  and shot over from 25 yards before O&#39;Neill sent on 20-year-old Shaun  Maloney to add fresh legs in attack, and he immediately caused problems  for the Porto back-line. <br><br>But the exhaustion took its final toll.  <br><br>Douglas spilled Marco Ferreira&#39;s shot, Derlei kept his cool,  moved inside one challenge and hammered the ball into the net to end  those Celtic&#39;s dreams. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>   <h3>  Celtic (0) 2 FC Porto (1) 3 AET </h3>  <h3>  2-2 after 90  minutes </h3><b>(Telegraph)</b>   <br>A slow burner of a UEFA Cup final  reached a thrilling climax in Seville last night as Celtic lost to FC  Porto in extra time.<br>After a first half where tempers rather than  technique were the talking point, the second half burst into life with  Celtic showing the spirit that had taken them this far by twice coming  from behind.<br><br>If Deco was the game&#39;s most skilful player, Henrik  Larsson again underlined his predatorial instincts with his 43rd and  44th goals of the season, causing a suspect Porto defence anxious  moments both in the air and on the ground.<br><br>Man for man, the  Portuguese champions may have been superior but Celtic&#39;s drive, passion  and never-say-die attitude with outstanding individuals such as Larsson  and Didier Agathe made them a match for Jose Mourinho&#39;s side.<br><br>However,  after Bobo Balde&#39;s sending off in the first period of extra time, Porto  went ahead through Vanderlei Derlei in the 115th minute and Celtic were  powerless to respond.<br><br>The atmosphere inside the Estadio Olimpico  as the game started was as good as it gets - noise without nastiness,  passion without punch-ups.

FC  Porto, who have just clinched their 19th Portuguese title on the back of  a 27-week unbeaten run, had been expected to struggle with many tipping  them to finish behind Sporting Lisbon, Benfica and Boavista.<br><br>Although  the supporters behaved themselves, the early stages were marked by  heavy challenges from both sides. Joos Valgaeren was the first cautioned  for a lunge at Deco.<br><br>When the over-physical side subsided, Porto  began to show their class with Deco impressing in midfield. They were  superior in technique but looked vulnerable to crosses into their area.<br><br>In  the 22nd minute, Larsson, who had been fouled by Maniche, tested Vitor  Baia with a well struck, low free kick from 25 yards. Deco was causing  problems with his close control and tricky footwork and set up the  opening goal at the end of a generally mediocre first half.<br><br>After  Deco&#39;s cross, Rab Douglas did well to parry Alenichev&#39;s initial  fiercely struck shot from 10 yards but Derlei pounced on the rebound.<br><br>Tempers  rose again as the players made for the tunnel with an unsightly bout of  pushing and shoving involving coaches, too, which was sparked by Derlei  unsportingly kicking the ball at Agathe&#39;s stomach.<br><br>Within two  minutes of the restart Celtic were level when Larsson exploited Porto&#39;s  frailty in the air. From Didier Agathe&#39;s deep cross from the right,  Larsson, on the far post, sent a looping header over Baia for his 200th  goal for the club.<br><br>The joy was shortlived, however, because in  the 54th minute Deco beat two opponents to set up the chance for  Alenichev to steer the ball past Douglas from 12 yards. But two minutes  later Larsson made it 2-2 when dreadful marking gave him a free header  from Alan Thompson&#39;s right-wing corner. The second half was proving to  be as exciting as the opening 45 minutes were tedious with the game  played at a remarkable pace given the heat.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>   <h3>  O&#39;Neill has fashioned feisty group(Telegraph) </h3>  <div class="story">  <div class="byline">  By David Miller<br>Last Updated:  5:51PM BST 03 Sep 2003</div>Thirty-six years ago Jock Stein turned water  into wine, winning the European Cup with a group of largely average  players.

That the Celtic support is a phenomenon totally unique in the<br>whole  of sport became undeniable when an estimated 70,000 of the faithful<br>converged  on Seville for the Uefa Cup Final in late May, and appropriated<br>that  beautiful city for a gigantic street party whose bonhomie remained<br>magnificently  undiluted after their team were beaten by Porto.

But Celtic&#39;s   <br>performance in the Stadio Olimpico last  night will long be savoured as a<br>special moment in footballing  history. In the oppressive heat of Seville,<br>with the searing pressure  of expectation on their shoulders, Martin O&#39;Neill<br>and his boys did  us proud. Despite the taunting of questionable<br>gamesmanship from a  less-then-sporting opposition, despite cold statistics<br>which cast  them in the role of underdogs, Celtic&#39;s team of heroes fought on<br>with  dignity, with spirit and with a passion that all but a few would<br>struggle  to match. Yet, while disappointment hangs heavily in the air<br>today,  there is no shame in defeat for either them or their faithful legion<br>of  fans. Anyone who witnessed last nights 120-minute rollercoaster of<br>drama  and emotion cannot fail to have been inspired by the commitment and<br>courage  mustered by every player who donned the hooped shirt. To a man<br>they  played for the jersey - an old-fashioned concept many of the modern<br>game&#39;s  new millionaire stars (and their supporters) simply do not understand.<br><br>And  if last night&#39;s Celtic squad can be held up as models of good conduct,<br>so  too can the 50,000 - plus fans who made the pilgrimage to share in<br>their  moment in the limelight. Despite their huge numbers (and awesome<br>volume  of alcohol sunk during colourful street fiestas) not one fan was<br>arrested  on match day, rightly earning them praise at the highest levels as<br>&quot;consummate  ambassadors.&quot; The football world is now well-used to the<br>humour and  spirit of the seemingly indefatigable Tartan Army. This week in<br>the  overwhelming but good-natured invasion of Spain, the Green Division<br>took  the reputation of Scottish fans to a new level. Leaving the troubles<br>of  everyday life behind, conveniently forgetting the hefty credit cards<br>bills  that will soon follow them home they set out to party and extend the<br>hand  of friendship to whoever they met. From rock stars to roadsweepers,<br>they  arrived with the confidence they could compete on an equal level with<br>Europe&#39;s  elite. But they did so in the spirit of friendship and warmth,<br>intent  on savouring the experience, whatever the result at the final whistle.<br><br>Scotland  has left Seville with its reputation enhanced and its head held<br>high.  Glorious defeat is scant consolation. But there is so much<br>potential  to build on the sense of pride of team and country that thousands<br>cannot  fail to have taken from last night&#39;s experience. Larsson, Douglas,<br>Thomson  et al may not have their achievements engraved on Uefa silverware<br>today,  but it is etched in the hearts of genuine football fans the world over.    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  (Evening Times) ALAN  PATTULLO</h3>IT IS, ostensibly, the morning after the night before  though time has   <br>grown steadily more inconsequential here in  Seville.

I didn&#39;t feel much like<br>celebrating, which  is an unusual emotion in Seville. But Colm and<br>company from Finbar&#39;s  pub in Madrid insisted. They had bought the last<br>40 litres of  Cruzcampo from the all-night kiosk beside the river and<br>were having a  pavement party.<br><br>Colm and his pals were skilled, if inebriated,  gymnasts and gave<br>impressive displays of somersaults and forward  rolls for the benefit of<br>the occupants of passing Porto supporters&#39;  buses. I think Colm and Co<br>were hinting at a certain amount of diving  and unsporting theatricality<br>on the part of the Porto players.<br><br>There  is no room here, and even if there were I probably could not find<br>the  words to express the pride I feel in Celtic football club, its fans,<br>players,  and a bloke called Martin O&#39;Neill.<br><br>Runners-up?

So goes a  song extolling the city&#39;s beauty by Los del R&iacute;o, the band who gave the  world the Macarena. Whether they had in mind the colours of UEFA Cup  finalists Celtic FC is a moot point. However, as the headline in one  local newspaper put it yesterday: &quot;Seville woke up green and white.&quot; <br><br><b>Everything&#39;s  gone green</b><br>More than 27,000 shirts were sold when Celtic&#39;s new  kit went on sale last week and every single one of them appeared to be  on display on the streets of the Andalusian capital ahead of the final  against FC Porto. If it was not a Celtic shirt, it was the stripes of  Real Betis Balompi&eacute; - the local club whose colours derived from a set of  Celtic kits brought to Seville in 1909. <br><br><b>Supporters&#39; songs</b><br>The  central Plaza de San Francisco was taken over by the Glasgow club&#39;s  supporters - reddening under the fierce sun - who, prompted by a  cheerleader from the Daily Record newspaper, ran through their  repertoire of songs. Despite an official allocation of 15,700 tickets  each, some 60,000 Celtic fans and 25,000 from Porto were here. <br><br><b>&#39;Fiesta  de f&uacute;tbol&#39;</b><br>A total of 350 charter flights landed in this corner  of Spain and the arriving sets of fans mingled happily and ensured this  final really did match its billing as a &#39;Fiesta de f&uacute;tbol&#39;. The UEFA Cup  may have been overshadowed by the UEFA Champions League&#39;s recent  expansion, but here was a spectacle to savour. <br><br><b>Anthems aired</b><br>The  Spanish press made much of Celtic&#39;s Roman Catholic connections. ABC  featured a photo of four supporters kneeling at the cathedral&#39;s altar  and thousands of Celtic fans congregated there on the eve of the final.  Crowded under the orange trees, against the backdrop of the cathedral&#39;s  Moorish minaret, the lovely 12th-century Giralda, they filled the night  sky with their anthems. <br><br><b>City drunk dry</b><br>In a city famed  for its religious processions, however, this was very much a secular  pilgrimage. Their presence beside the cathedral had much to do with its  proximity to Flaherty&#39;s Irish pub: the establishment is believed to have  sold two months&#39; worth of beer in five days. The Seville public have  looked on with a mixture of amusement and astonishment. Miguel Garc&iacute;a,  whose bookshop looks on to the cathedral, said: &quot;I have not seen  anything like it - not even during the 1982 [FIFA] World Cup.&quot; <br><br><b>Passionate  atmosphere</b><br>Before the match Porto coach Jos&eacute; Mourinho had  complained about the rutted state of the Estadio Ol&iacute;mpico pitch, relaid  just three weeks ago. Venue of an athletics world championship, it may  not be a natural football arena yet there was nothing wrong with the  atmosphere. Inside the 52,000-capacity stadium, Celtic fans outnumbered  their counterparts by at least two to one. Las Ketchup, the Andalusian  singing sisters, added some spice before kick-off with a rendition of  their hit song &#39;Aserej&eacute;&#39;, but the supporters&#39; efforts were more  memorable. <br><br><b>Stage set</b><br>Moments before the teams came  out, the Porto fans unfurled a huge banner displaying the badges of all  their victims en route to Seville. The Celtic end raised their scarves  and sang &#39;You&#39;ll Never Walk Alone&#39;. The stage was set and two past  European champions produced something memorable. They traded goals, and  songs too - &quot;N&oacute;s somos campe&otilde;es&quot; one minute, &quot;We shall not be moved&quot; the  next. The air thickened with insects, extra time came and Derlei won  the game for Porto. Portugal had its first UEFA Cup winners. A Porto  banner said it all: &quot;Another glorious chapter in our history.&quot; The  Celtic fans? They just carried on singing.   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>   <h3>  Derlei denies Celtic place among legends</h3><font face="Microsoft Sans Serif" size="2">(Independent)</font>   <br><font face="Microsoft Sans Serif" size="2"><b>Celtic 2 Porto 3 </b><br><br>By  Phil Shaw in Seville<br>Thursday, 22 May 2003 <br>The first so-called  Silver Goal ended Celtic&#39;s hopes of a golden finale to a thrilling Uefa  Cup campaign in the Olympic Stadium last night.

Porto,  facing 10 men for all but five minutes of extra time after Bobo Balde  was sent off for a second bookable offence, settled a dramatic final  through the Brazilian Derlei with five minutes of the additional  half-hour left.<br><br>Rab Douglas could only beat out a shot by Marco  Ferreira and Derlei drove it back in, the ball entering the net off  Ulrik Laursen. Unlike the final of two years ago, when a &quot;golden&quot; own  goal by Alaves gave the trophy to Liverpool, Porto had to play out the  remaining time. They had Nuno Valente dismissed for a second yellow card  as the tie entered injury time, but held on with few alarms.<br><br>In  normal time - not that there was anything normal about this cacophonous  occasion - the teams had traded four goals during a dizzying 12-minute  spell either side of half-time. Porto, a more polished outfit who had  the outstanding individual in the artful Deco, led twice through Derlei  and Dmitri Alenichev.<br><br>Yet Celtic&#39;s collective heart is as big as a  cathedral. Each time they produced instant equalisers, both from Henrik  Larsson&#39;s head. Once they were depleted by Balde&#39;s folly, however, they  had little chance of conjuring the third riposte that would have earned  a penalty shoot-out.<br><br>At the bitter end Celtic and their vast  following, who had been hoping to emulate Jock Stein&#39;s 1967 Lions of  Lisbon, had to endure the hated sight of a blue-and-white celebration,  knowing only too well that it will merely be a preview of Sunday&#39;s final  instalment in the struggle for the Scottish title should Rangers  prevail.<br><br>Martin O&#39;Neill, the Celtic manager, certainly faces one  of the toughest tests of his managerial career to lift his troops for  their 60th game of the season. Winning at Kilmarnock would have been  hard enough without a prolonged battle in sapping heat.<br><br>Many of  Celtic&#39;s green army, who had made pilgrimages from the United States  (&quot;Texas Fenian Bhoys&quot; read one banner), the Far East, Europe, Tyneside,  Ireland and even Glasgow, booed Porto as they stepped up to claim their  prize. Some of the Portuguese theatrics, notably a dying-swan act by  keeper Vitor Baia when he had not been touched, left a sour taste, but  overall they were the superior side.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s support outnumbered  Porto&#39;s by three to one, but sadly an ear-bleeding barrage of noise is  no guarantee of victory. Porto, as their coach Jose Mourinho noted, are  accustomed to performing at venues where all the crowd are against them.<br><br>In  a contest strewn with players crashing to the turf - there were nearly  60 fouls - they had the better of the exchanges despite making an early  substitution. Costinha, the midfield anchor, seemed to pull a muscle  while executing a pass and gave way to Ricardo Costa. It was already  evident that Celtic had earmarked Deco, the Brazilian-born Portuguese  international, as the principal source of danger. One illegal challenge  on him, by Joos Valgaeren, resulted in Douglas making the first save of  note from Maniche&#39;s 25-yard volley following a free-kick routine.<br><br>Playing  a longer, less intricate game than Porto, Celtic gradually settled, and  Baia&#39;s hands needed to be at their most adhesive to prevent their  taking the lead midway through the first half. Larsson, fouled by  Maniche, bludgeoned the free-kick which the keeper did well to hold as  Valgaeren darted in looking for scraps.<br><br>Celtic lived dangerously  when a corner kick landed in their six-yard box, and again as Deco swept  past one defender before Neil Lennon lunged to deflect his shot behind,  but they were caught out in first-half stoppage tine. Deco&#39;s exquisite  chipped pass across the penalty area found Alenichev unmarked, and when  Douglas could only parry the Russian&#39;s shot, Derlei nipped in to convert  the rebound.<br><br>The second half was about to start when a male  spectator ran on, dropped his shorts in the centre circle and ran away,  ball at his feet, towards Baia&#39;s goal. The keeper stuck out a leg to  prevent his net being ruffled as the interloper disappeared under a  scrum of police officers.<br><br>Within 100 seconds of the restart a  streak of altogether greater significance for Celtic was maintained.  Didier Agathe&#39;s deep cross found Larsson rising beyond the far post to  send a looping header back across goal. The ball struck the other  upright before rolling into the net for the Swede&#39;s 200th goal for  Celtic.<br><br>In the 54th minute, Porto edged in front again, and once  more Deco was the creator, beating Valgaeren before his pass split the  Celtic defence, allowingAlenichev to despatch a crisp drive past  Douglas.<br><br>A third goal in 11 minutes brought Celtic level before  the hour. A short corner resulted in the left-footed Alan Thompson  swinging the ball in from the right, whereupon Larsson materialised  unchallenged in the heart of Porto&#39;s area, like the instinctive finisher  he is, to make it 2-2 and 201.<br><br>Suddenly, the game was living up  to expectations. Celtic, far from wilting in the humid conditions, were  full of running after their two swift levellers until Balde left them  facing a thankless task. Derlei, by drilling in his 12th goal in the  competition, not only edged in front of Larsson as top scorer but left  O&#39;Neill facing the prospect of Celtic&#39;s most exciting season since the  Stein era ending bereft of silverware.<br><br>Celtic 2 <br>Larsson 47,  57<br>Porto 3 <br>Derlei 45, 115, Alenichev 54<br>Aet; 2-2 at 90 min  Att: 52,972<br><br>Celtic (3-5-2): <br>Douglas; Mjallby, Balde,  Valgaeren (Laursen, 64); Agathe, Lambert, (McNamara, 76), Lennon, Petrov  (Maloney, 104), Thompson; Larsson, Sutton.

Made fines saves from Deco and Alenitchev.  Not at fault for first two goals, unlucky with third.<br><br>Johan  Mjallby 6 <br>Mostly composed and tidy, making powerful challenges.  Wandered slightly at times.<br><br>Bobo Balde 7 <br>Seemed nervy in  opening exchanges, but gained composure to get typically tough tackles  in. Too tough in the end - he was sent off in extra-time.<br><br>Joos  Valgaeren 5 <br>Earned an early yellow card by taking out Deco, which  tempered his tackling thereafter.<br><br>Didier Agathe 6 <br>Made his  trademark wide runs and quick, accurate crosses infrequently, but superb  delivery for Larsson&#39;s second.<br><br>Paul Lambert 7 <br>The biggest  problem in the first half was a lack of possession. When it came, he ran  with it and used the ball cleverly.<br><br>Neil Lennon 6 <br>Given  responsibility for picking up Deco, no easy task. But tackled and  pressed with increasing urgency.<br><br>Stilian Petrov 6 <br>A strong  start in the middle, alternately harrying for the ball and patient for  chance to pass.<br><br>Alan Thompson 6 <br>Gave options for width on the  left that were under-exploited. Most effective when he slowed the pace  to find a telling pass.<br><br>Henrik Larsson 8 <br>Used his brain for  dainty first-half runs and touches then his head for two equalisers, one  excellent, one simply powerful.<br><br>Chris Sutton 7 <br>Worked  tirelessly against run of play to win the ball and act as a decoy for  Larsson. Brave late assistance in midfield.<br><br>SUBSTITUTES<br>Ulrik  Laursen 5 (on for Valgaeren, 64) Added touch of composure.<br>Jackie  McNamara 4 (on for Lambert, 76) Gave away the ball twice in dangerous  positions.<br>Shaun Maloney 6 (on for Petrov, 104) Fresh legs provided  promise, but wasted opportunities.<br><br><b>PORTO</b><br><br>Vitor Baia  4/10 <br>Mixed. No brilliance required or given despite one good save.  Pathetic, cynical time-wasting at death.<br><br>Paulo Ferreira 6 <br>Eager  to attack down the right, he risked leaving space by pressing forward,  but tracked back well.<br><br>Jorge Costa 6 <br>Ex-Charlton defender  showed early aggression but calmed down and passed well.<br><br>Ricardo  Carvalho 5 <br>Used power and height to good effect. But, like some  team-mates, suffered lapses of concentration.<br><br>Nuno Valente 6 <br>Can  take some credit for Larsson having quiet first half. Passing was  fluid. Marred his night with deserved red card.<br><br>Deco 9 <br>As far  as Celtic were concerned, a constant menace with his pace, deft  footwork, quick brain, neat passing and ease on the ball. A gem.<br><br>Costinha  4 <br>Lasted less than nine minutes before succumbing to injury.<br><br>Capucho  7 <br>Upping tempo then slowed it seemingly at will. Combined superbly  with Derlei. Ran all night.<br><br>Maniche 6 <br>Mostly played a  midfield holding role in front on the defence. Erred when going forward.<br><br>Derlei  8 <br>Persistent threat on the edge of the box. Livewire when dropping  deep. Thumped the opener and extra-time winner.<br><br>Dmitri Alenichev 8  <br>Anonymous for 30 minutes then exploded into game and scored a  composed goal.<br><br>SUBSTITUTES<br>Ricardo Costa 5 (on for Costinha,  9) Steady throughout.<br>Pedro Emanuel 5 (on for Jorge Costa, 71) Solid  performance.<br>Marco Ferreira 5 (on for Capucho, 98) Became frustrated,  but assisted in winner.<br>Marks by Nick Harris <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></font>   <br></div></div>
