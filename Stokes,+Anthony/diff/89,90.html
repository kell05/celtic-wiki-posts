He was not going to let go of this chance after squandering  his first opportunity to come to Celtic.   <br><br>The deadline day deal  was the Bhoys&#39; eleventh signing of a busy summer as Parkhead boss Neil  Lennon set about rebuilding his side.<br><br><b>Pre-Celtic</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Stokes, Anthony - Pics" height="390" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/3xRT_UBWdv2DXtu9aFabfg38690/GW280H390" title="Stokes, Anthony - Pics" width="280"></h3>A Republic of Ireland  international, Stokes began his professional career at Arsenal but made  his name while at loan with Falkirk in the SPL. At the outset he was lauded for his talents, with a former leading Irish football coach (John Bolger)rating him as &quot;the most talented teenager to come out of this country [Ireland]&quot;, and that was quite an accolade when one of his peers included Robbie Keane.<br><br>The striker hit  14 goals in 16 games for the Bairns during the first few months of the  2006-7 season. That scintillating form caught the eye of several clubs  and in January 2007 the player was the centre of much transfer  speculation and after keen interest from Celtic and Charlton Athletic he  eventually opted to join Sunderland, then in the English Championship.  It was a daft move and prompted Celtic Manager Gordon Strachan to say:  &ldquo;If people don&rsquo;t want to come here, win titles and play with good  players at the highest level in Europe in front of 60,000 fans with a  chance of becoming a legendary figure that&rsquo;s fine by me, If you can get  that elsewhere, then fair enough.&rdquo; It became quite an apt quote for  Stokes in time.<br><br>Ex-Celt Roy Keane, the Black Cats manager, paid  Arsenal a &pound;2 million fee for the player and although the Wearsiders made  it into the Premiership, Stokes ultimately failed to impress. Roy Keane  railed: &quot;Anthony could be a top player or he could be playing  non-League in five years!&quot;. In 2008-09 loan spells at Sheffield United  and Crystal Palace were also uninspiring while off the field  disciplinary problems made Stokes&#39; departure from the Stadium of Light  increasingly inevitable.<br><br>In August 2009 the Dubliner returned to  Scotland when his former Falkirk boss John Hughes - now at charge at  Hibernian - paid a reported &pound;500,000 for his services. Back in the SPL  Stokes once more had no problem hitting the goal trail and by the end of  the 2009-10 campaign he had hit 22 goals for the Edinburgh club.<br><br><b>Celtic Career first few seasons...</b><br>With  Celtic eager to recruit a predatory goal-scorer they turned their  attention to the Hibs man in August 2010 and managed to complete a deal  on the final day of the transfer window. Stokes made his Celtic debut on  September 11 as the Hoops defeated Hearts 3&ndash;0 at Parkhead. The Dubliner  scored his first goal for the club in his second appearance when he  grabbed the winner in a 2&ndash;1 victory against Kilmarnock.<br><br>Playing  alongside fellow new Bhoy Gary Hooper Stokes began to hit a run of  scoring form including a hat-trick in a 9&ndash;0 victory over Aberdeen. But  as 2010 came to the end Celtic and the Irish international suffered a  slump in form. Stokes would find himself on the bench for the vital New  Year game at Rangers. Despite this, the partnership between Stokes and  Hooper quickly began to blossom, mainly due to the superb link up play  and awareness between the two and thus by mid February 2011 had become  the mainstay in the first team (pushing back Samaras).<br><br>Stokes  much to his credit in this game and others is a grafter and worked his  socks off. His goal tallies over the seasons have been testament to this  and Hooper would likely pass credit to his striking partner for his  role in his own success. Stokes will eke out those goals that will win  us points that matter at the end of the season. <br><br>For season  2010/11 &amp; 2011/12, he more than proved his worth scoring 20 &amp; 21  goals respectively. In particular, Neil Lennon more than most owes a  debt. If it were not for Stokes double that brought us the draw against  Kilmarnock away in the first half of 2011/2012 when Cetic were three  down at half time, then it would have been curtains for Lennon. At  point, Celtic were incredibly languishing behind Rangers early in the  league, and a defeat would have been the end for the manager.<br><br>It  can&#39;t be taken lightly for what Stokes did in this game in retrospect.  Following the success of Lennon in the next eighteen months (both in  Europe and domestically), his two goals were to be worth more than just  the three points. They are invaluable, and rarely have they been as  pivotal to one man (for Lennon) than any other for such a general league  match. Literally saved his job. Seeing Lennon achieve so much and be  there when the Huns liquidated was just perfect, yet it would not have  happened without Stokes part in the comeback of that Killie match. For  that at least, Stokes will be remembered very fondly. <br><br>Stokes goals helped push Celtic to the title in 2011/12, and it brought him the title medal he deserved in his career. <br><br>However,  Tony Stokes had been unfortunate. Overshadowed by the free scoring  Hooper, many have undervalued his quality and worth to the first team.  The generally less effective Samaras was given more leeway (unfairly in  the eyes of sympathisers) and the manager preferred to play Samaras in  crunch games ahead of Stokes. Notably, in practically all games v  Rangers (Oldco), Stokes was placed on the bench despite calls that he  should be in the starting eleven.<br><br>Sadly, he was an easy target  for the Hun bigots due to his Irish background. Yobs attacked his home  and targeted him and there were a spate of similar abuse against him  over his time at Celtic. Clear examples of intimidation were via twitter  where supposed anonymity from Huns gave them a platform to threaten  Stokes. Nobody deserves that. Can&#39;t be condoned. Despite the harassment  he would not let them get to him, and likely it contributed to his  growing love for Celtic. He celebrated each goal as if it were a cup  winner. The fans definitely took to him and those moments.<br><br>In  truth, there were plenty who have not been convinced by Stokes but the  final statistics show his worth is greater than critics would have you  believe. The ends justify the means with what he brings to the side even  though it will never be as flamboyant as that of some of his  colleagues. He will reward on the pitch anyone who puts any trust in him  and that is as great a compliment as you can say about him. Some  crudely said he was only of value for the SPL, and admitting that he was  very good in the SPL but his double in the match against Rennes in the  UEFA Cup indicates he could be more than that.<br><br>Mirroring the  sometimes indifferent attitude to Stokes at Celtic from the management  it could be the same at international level. He was overlooked for the  Irish national side for the European Championships in 2012 where Ireland  succumbed to the strength of their group (playing eventual finalists  Italy &amp; Spain) winning no matches, no points, just one goal and  conceding nine. It would be a bit of a stretch to claim that Stokes  would have turned it around it for them, but taking in their  incompetence in the tournament, surely Stokes would have been a positive  addition and would have done better than many who were taken along. His  work-effort alone could have rubbed off on the others.<br><br><b>Off-field Events</b><br>One  irksome aspect about Stokes is that he wasn&#39;t particularly very diligent  off the field. Due to the partisan and goldfish bowl nature of the  domestic press and the historical legacy of Irish social &amp; political  issues, to err on the side of caution is very heavily recommended. He  ended up creating a stooshie in December 2012 after attending the  funeral and wake of an old friend in Dublin, who the press (UK and  Ireland) tagged as being a leader of splinter group &#39;the Real IRA&#39; and a  major gangster etc etc, allegedly responsible for the murder of two  people. <br><br>The whole details of all this is outwith of the scope of  this site, and can be analysed in more appropriate forums, however if  Stokes wished to pay his respects many would have preferred a more  discreet tribute. The club was forced to comment and there were Celtic  supporters in Dublin with less than respectful comments on Stokes, let  alone the opinion outwith of the club. It could unfairly reflect  negatively on the club when there was no involvement whatsoever  excluding Stokes. <br><br>In fairness to Stokes, it&#39;s difficult as maybe  he only knew him as a friend and paid his respects to the dead man&#39;s  family. He knew the deceased via his own family&#39;s pub, and Stokes&#39; dad  was already a cause celebre with some in Dublin after his anti-monarch  banners in the previous year made headlines, making it clear where his  allegiances lay. Stokes though should have been more careful, and it  gave the press a field day on the issue. Lennon even publicly had to  state that Stokes had been disciplined over the matter to provide  closure. It was all an unwelcome headache for the club. The support was  moving on with the events in regard to the N Irish situation. This was  an unwelcome situation, although in truth it wasn&#39;t an issue for much of  our support no matter how much the press stoked it all up.<br><br>For  all the criticism that Stokes has been given of what his true level  actually is, he did play an important part to get us to the top table.  In a vital match in Aug 2013, Celtic were 2-0 down from the first leg v  Shakter Kuragandy. Celtic fought back, and in the final minutes, Stokes  grabbed the ball and with some exceptional sublime skill, dribbled the  ball into the box and around a few players before selflessly playing a  clever pass to Forrest in the box who buried the ball and sent us  through. <br> <br> It clearly highlighted the talent in him, and he was  the creator of a moment that had now immeasurably paid the club back. In  the past, he would generally not play in vital games, he did here and  repaid the faith in him. He actually helped play a part in the second  goal too. It&#39;s usually the scorers who are remembered, but in this this  case the man who set up the assists should also get some credit. <br> <br>  Stokes had hunger. He looked to get on the ball, he almost always pushed  for a pass and whilst he was frequently selfish, it&rsquo;s largely because  he made up his mind about what he was going to do. Single-minded determination is what had carried him throughout his career,  and a good striker usually has a selfish streak. <br> <br><b>Celtic Career final two seasons</b><br> The 2013/14  season should have been a turning point for him, as Celtic had just lost  Hooper and so the gap provided the opportunity for Stokes to stake his  claim. His return was good but didn&#39;t show any real progress, and it  compounded problems at the club as all the strikers were misfiring  (relying on Commons to bail them out). In the past, the first team  seemed to be able to fall back on Stokes for goals in the domestic  set-up. That now seemed to not be the case, and in Europe he failed to  score in eleven games.<br><br> A great performance that brought him  plaudits was his hat trick against St Johnstone in February 2014, a pick  me up needed after the club was knocked out the cup the past weekend.  This performance saw the best of him, but was it enough? In retrospect  it wasn&#39;t. He was scoring goals, just wasn&#39;t in the same sphere as  Hooper. Most of his goals were in the last third of the season, by which  time the league was already wrapped up. <br><br> Some blamed the team  system rather than Stokes, but that was disingenuous. He had to fit into  the side, and he wasn&#39;t so blessed a talent that the rest should have  fitted around him.<br><br> Season 2014-15 was obviously signalling the  end of his Celtic time. New manager Deila didn&#39;t seem convinced, and  with Griffith&#39;s star rising, Stokes was again back in the queue. His  goal ratio to games was comparatively poor and a fresh start was needed.  Both Deila and his team were emphasising work rate off the pitch in  training as much as on the pitch in matches, and Stokes probably away  from matches wasn&#39;t a model pupil for the new regime, not that he was by  far the worst offender either. One newspaper report claimed that a man  had approached Stokes to use his family connections to obtain guns for  them (never substantiated), and press like that doesn&#39;t help anyone&#39;s  case.<br> <br>Didn&#39;t help his case when he appeared in Court charged  with assaulting an Elvis impersonator in Dublin on a night out. More  frustrating was to come. Celtic were to play Inter Milan in the UEFA Cup  Round of 32, a big night and emotional for some (taking in Lisbon  1967), plus a big test for Ronny Deila. Stokes ended up arriving late  from Dublin and was duly fined and dumped from the squad. An incredible  night saw Celtic draw 3-3, and nobody was concerned that Stokes was  absent. For such a major game he should have been prepared and back in  Glasgow well in advance, it didn&#39;t appear to show he had his priorities  right. As Deila was to say: &quot;This is a night that is going to teach me  about my players!&quot;, so what did that say about Stokes? Probably a dig at  him that was maybe best left behind closed doors by the manager.<br><br>  After being much unused in the first half of season 2015-16, even  childishly tweeting his frustration at being taken up north for a game  at Inverness CT on the bench, he was sent to Hibs on loan (then in the  second tier). The challenge was for Hibs to beat Sevco to the league  title, it wasn&#39;t to be and Stokes scoring record in the league was poor.  It didn&#39;t end there, and Stokes experienced one of the great highs of  his career by helping Hibs beat Sevco in the Scottish Cup final 3-2 with  a superb double, their first Scottish Cup triumph for over 100 years. <br> <br>  On return to Celtic he was freed for his own benefit. No real surprise  but at just 27 years of age for many strikers it should be the prime of  their career. <br><br> <b>Post-Celtic</b><br> In reflection on his career, he never reached  the heights that many had forecast for him. He had done well at Celtic  and despite not being a flash player, his work-rate and commitment meant  he was widely appreciated. Other players were better talents but Stokes  still outlasted many of them including a plethora of misguided and  overvalued foreign talents e.g. Miku, Pukki, Brozek etc. <br> <br> One  major problem was that he was being left behind as tactics were  evolving. He was becoming a square peg in a round hole, best as a second  striker in a pair in an environment where that role was being phased  out in the modern game, and was seen as a false luxury. His poor record  in European matches reflected his greatest value was for the domestic  set-up. <br> <br> There were generally better players who would be ahead  in the queue, but what Stokes lacked in some quarters he made up for in  others, and in retrospect he probably deserved more opportunities in a  number of higher profile games than he was given the chance. Too often  side-lined for various games against Rangers (OldCo) and European  competition, yet still called upon in many other matches to perform, and  that he often did. <br> <br> The sad irony for Tony Stokes was that he  was leaving Celtic on a free when even inferior fellow ex-Celt Daryl  Murphy had once been touted within the second tier in England for  around &pound;4-5m in 2015. Murphy had been overshadowed by Stokes for a main  place at Celtic (which Murphy himself conceded in a retrospective  comment), but he had finally managed a very productive season at Ipswich  and gained a number of caps in an admittedly poor Rep of Ireland  national team (albeit reached last 16 of Euros 2016). Neither were  really reaching any heights, and Murphy despite the price-tag was still  no great striker (over 20 international caps and no goals), his price  more a reflection of the irrational marketplace in England rather than  anything qualitative. <br> <br> The question is whether Stokes would  rather have been in Murphy&#39;s shoes? Was he likely bothered? Probably  not, as despite the often second string role he occupied, he still  garnered an experience and life that many others can only dream about by  being at Celtic. It&#39;s not just the money or transfer tag, but what you  achieve as he was to learn comparing his failed time down south to that  in Scotland. He has much to take pride in from his time at Celtic, and  was clearly a Celtic supporter. <br> <br> Tony Stokes had scored a number of  important goals in his time at Celtic, and his pivotal performance in  that 3-3 match v Kilmarnock to save Lennon&#39;s position as manager will be  what he will be remembered for best, without which the support would  have missed out on some great Celtic memories under Neil Lennon. <br><br>Many years later the curious point is that 3-3 draw with Kilmarnock was to be seen by some as having greater significance, and seen as a turning point that sparked life back into Celtic and was the true start to the  challenge for a record ten-in-a-row league titles (at time of writing 8-in-a-row  had been achieved). Tony Stokes was an unlikely spark and originator to this and must be given a good note for this.<br> <br><div> We wish him the best. </div><div></div><div></div><div>[...to add notes on his stints abroad post-celtic in Iran <span class="diffRemove">etc...]</span><span class="diffAdd">etc...</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">In 2019, he was sacked by his club in Iran, reported to FIFA and urged to pay back his wages.
