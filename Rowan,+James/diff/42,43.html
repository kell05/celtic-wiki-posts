Up to the summer of his debut for the first team, he had been a fitter with Harland and Wolff (shipbuilders).<br><br>He made a scoring debut when he netted the fourth goal in a 4-1 league win over Dundee at Parkhead on 18th December 1954, taking over from <a href="/page/Higgins%2C+John" target="_self">John Higgins</a> but losing out to <a href="/page/Boden%2C+Alec" target="_self">Alec Boden</a>, two wonderful players for Celtic at a difficult time for Celtic.  It was Charlie Tully who created the goal with Rowan at the end of the chance:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;Tully made the third goal with a dash down the wing before centring and  his cross coming off the face of the crossbar where Brown only  succeeded in palming it onto Rowan and the ball rolled over the line for  the thrid goal.&quot;<br></i></blockquote><br>However Jim Rowan would only make one more competitive appearance, a 2-1 defeat to Hearts away in the following season on <a href="/page/1955-10-08%3A+Heart+of+Midlothian+2-1+Celtic%2C+League+Division+A" target="_self">8 Oct 1955</a>, filling in for one of a few players out for international duty it seems. <br><br>He was released by the club in April 1956, at was a difficult time for the club. The club had been poor most of post-war but had just past their purple patch with the Coronation Cup and League &amp; Cup double having just past as James Rowan made it into the first team. <br><br>He went on to play for Clyde, Stirling Albion, Dunfermline, Airdrie and Falkirk, where after he joked that: <br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;I may not have won many medals but I sure have some collection of club ties.&rdquo; </i><br></blockquote><br>He eventually moved first into coaching with Falkirk Reserves where he fell foul of the SFA for writing for the Press at the same time he was coaching.<br><br>This whetted his appetite for the politics &amp; management of sport and he became Chairman of the Scottish Professional Footballers Association. He then returned briefly to playing with Partick Thistle before going into management.<br><br>He was the manager at East Stirling until the club management lost patience with the youth policy. Who did they replace him with in a few years time? A man entering his first steps in management, none other than the legendary Alex Ferguson.</div><div></div><div><br>Jim Rowan later scouted for Celtic and then coached at Clyde on a part-time basis but involved in many aspects of running the club. He left Clyde in July 1975 due to the pressure of his business commitments. After football, he ran the Horseshoe Bar in Airdrie.<br><br>He remained a Celtic man at heart, with ex-Celt John Hughes remarking: <br><blockquote><i>&quot;Despite the brevity of his Celtic career, he remained a very big Celtic fan and used to say to me if he was in the house when an Old Firm game was on TV, he had to go out for a walk as he couldn&rsquo;t bear the tension!&quot; </i><br></blockquote><br>Jim Rowan passed away in 2015, having watched his second successor at East Stirling (Alex Ferguson) scale the heights and having now retired only a couple of years before Jim Rowan&#39;s own passing. </div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>  </div><h3>  Playing Career </h3><div></div><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES<br><br></font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  1952-56</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  n/a</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  2</td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  Goals</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">0</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  -</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>  </div><h3>  Honours</h3><div>None </div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>  </div><h3>  Pictures</h3><div>  </div><ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Rowan%2C+James+-Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><div>  </div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>Obituary<span class="diffAdd"> </span><br></h3><h3><span class="diffAdd">Jim Rowan</span><br></h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">JACK DAVIDSON </span><a class="external" href="http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-jim-rowan-footballer-and-publican-1-3821186" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-jim-rowan-footballer-and-publican-1-3821186</a> <br> <br>updated 19:47 Friday 03 July 2015 published 00:00 Saturday 04 July 2015<br><br>Born: 27 July, 1935, in Glasgow. Died: 21 June, 2015, in Airdrie, aged 79 <br><br>Jim Rowan, who has died weeks short of his 80th birthday, enjoyed a notable football career during which he played more than 250 games between 1954 and 1970, mostly in the old 1st Division. His career was book-ended by spells at Celtic and Partick Thistle while in between he played for Stirling Albion, Clyde, Dunfermline Athletic, Airdrie and Falkirk. Self-mockingly, he once joked: &ldquo;I may not have won many medals but I sure have some collection of club ties.&rdquo; <br><br>As chairman of the Players&rsquo; Union in the late 1960s, he also made his mark off the pitch, promoting and protecting the interests of fellow players. In that capacity he was a colleague of Sir Alex Ferguson, then a Union committee member. <br><br>On the pitch he also had dealings with Sir Alex but of a less harmonious nature. Playing for Falkirk against Rangers in the late 60s, he was sent off for punching Ferguson, then of Rangers. At that time, the future knight had a reputation for &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; use of his elbows and the two had clashed at a corner kick.The SFA suspended Rowan for two weeks for this misdemeanour.<br><br> Celtic manager Jimmy McGrory was impressed by Rowan&rsquo;s stylish play at inside forward for Shettleston Juniors and signed him in October 1952. The Bhoys were then about to enter a successful period, winning the Coronation Cup in 1953 and the League and Cup double in 1954, which made it difficult for youngsters like Rowan to break into the first team. <br><br>It was not till 18 December, 1954 that he made his first league appearance, against Dundee, scoring a goal in a 4-1 win, alongside teammates including Bobby Evans, Jock Stein, Charlie Tully and Bertie Peacock. A press report stated: &ldquo;New boy Rowan showed up well in his first game and should do well with more confidence.&rdquo; <br><br>Despite that auspicious start he only managed one more game, against Hearts, before being freed in 1956. <br><br>From Parkhead it was on to Clyde for three seasons, followed by a brief spell at Dunfermline before signing for Stirling Albion where he captained the team to the old 2nd Division title and was successfully converted from inside forward to wing half.<br><br>In 1962 he moved to Airdrie, where he had one of the most fulfilling spells of his career, playing almost 100 games in three years there and again captaining the side. Reports on him were complimentary: &ldquo;Acquiring Rowan&rsquo;s cultured football has been a good move by Airdrie. He has added poise, skill and confidence.&rdquo; <br><br>In 1964 Aberdeen wanted to sign him but for family reasons he remained at Airdrie. <br><br>In 1965 he joined Falkirk where he would spend four years, latterly coaching the reserves and being interim manager after John Prentice left and prior to Willie Cunningham&rsquo;s appointment. <br><br>That appointment led to some highly publicised rancour as Cunningham abruptly stripped Rowan of his coaching duties. When he complained to a journalist about this treatment, Cunningham responded by suspending him for 14 days for being in breach of contract by &ldquo;taking part in journalism&rdquo;. <br><br>Rowan appealed successfully to the SFA, which ruled that speaking to a journalist did not constitute &ldquo;taking part in journalism&rdquo;. <br><br>But that meant his days at Brockville were numbered and he made his final move to Partick Thistle, where he was player/coach till summer 1970 when he retired from playing. The dispute with Falkirk fired his interest in football politics leading to his becoming chairman of the Players&rsquo; Union. <br><br>Having had some coaching experience and armed with the top student award from the SFA coaching course at Largs, he was keen to try management. In 1970 he became manager at East Stirling but it did not work out and after a year he and the club parted company. <br><br>Three years later Alex Ferguson would cut his managerial teeth there. <br><br>He then scouted for Celtic for a spell before coaching at Clyde till 1975 when he left the game. <br><br>Jim Rowan was born and raised in Bridgeton, where he attended St Mungo&rsquo;s Academy. He was mostly a part-time player who worked initially as a toolmaker and latterly for a finance company. When he left football he built up a successful publican&rsquo;s business, particularly with the Horseshoe Bar in Airdrie till 1990 when he took early retirement. <br><br>This enabled him to spend more time with his family, to whom he was devoted, enjoying visits to Australia and Canada to see daughters who had settled there. He also enjoyed playing golf at Bothwell Castle Golf Club, where he was a member. <br><br>Grandson Colin Devine described him as &ldquo;a kind and gentle man who loved his football. Watching games on television, he was constantly analysing the play.&rdquo; <br><br>Former Celtic star John Hughes, a good friend, commented: &ldquo;Jim was a lovely man, very caring and very helpful.

This led him to joke,at his own expense, &quot;I may not have won many medals but I sure have some collection of club ties.&quot;<br><br>That did scant justice to a worthwhile career. Once his playing days finished, he managed East Stirlingshire, scouted for Celtic and coached at Clyde till 1975 when his &#39;hands on&#39; involvement with the game came to an end.<br><br>He also made his mark off the pitch as chairman of the Players&#39; Union in the late &#39;60&#39;s, promoting and protecting the interests of fellow professionals. In that capacity he was a colleague of Sir Alex Ferguson, then a Union committee member.<br><br>On the pitch he also had dealings with Sir Alex but of a less harmonious nature. Playing for Falkirk against Rangers in the late 60&#39;s, he was sent off for punching Ferguson then of Rangers. At that time, the future knight had a reputation for &#39;liberal&#39; use of his elbows and the two had clashed at a corner kick. The SFA suspended Rowan for two weeks for this misdemeanour.<br><br>Celtic manager Jimmy McGrory was impressed by Rowan&#39;s stylish play at inside forward for Shettleston Juniors and signed him in October 1952. The Bhoys were then about to enter a successful period winning the Coronation Cup in 1953 and the League and Cup double in 1954 which made it difficult for youngsters like Rowan to break into the first team. It was not till 18th December 1954 that he made his first league appearance, against Dundee, scoring a goal in a 4-1 win, alongside teammates including Bobby Evans, Jock Stein,Charlie Tully and Bertie Peacock.<br><br>A press report stated &quot;New boy Rowan showed up well in his first game and should do well with more confidence.&quot; Despite that auspicious start he only managed one more game, against Hearts, before being freed in 1956.<br><br>From Parkhead it was on to Clyde for three seasons, followed by a brief spell at Dunfermline before signing for Stirling Albion where he captained the team to the old 2nd Division title and was successfully converted from inside forward to wing half. In 1962 he moved to Airdrie where he had one of the most fulfilling spells of his career, playing almost 100 games in three years there and again captaining the side.<br><br>Reports on him were complimentary, &quot;Acquiring Rowan&#39;s cultured football has been a good move by Airdrie. He has added poise, skill and confidence.&quot; In 1964 Aberdeen wanted to sign him but for family reasons he remained at Airdrie.<br><br>In 1965 he joined Falkirk where he would spend four years, latterly coaching the reserves and being interim manager after John Prentice left and prior to Willie Cunningham&#39;s appointment. That appointment led to some highly publicised rancour as Cunningham abruptly stripped Rowan of his coaching duties. When he complained to a journalist about this treatment, Cunningham responded by suspending him for 14 days for being in breach of contract by &quot;taking part in journalism&quot;.<br><br>Rowan appealed successfully to the SFA who ruled that speaking to a journalist did not constitute &quot;taking part in journalism&quot;. But that meant his days at Brockville were numbered and he made his final move to Partick Thistle where he was player/coach till summer 1970 when he retired from playing. The dispute with Falkirk fired his interest in football politics leading to his becoming chairman of the Players&#39; Union.<br><br>Having had some coaching experience and armed with the top student award from the SFA coaching course at Largs, he was keen to try management. In 1970 he became manager at East Stirling but it did not work out and after a year he and the club parted company. Three years later Alex Ferguson would cut his managerial teeth there. He then scouted for Celtic for a spell before coaching at Clyde till 1975 when he left the game.<br><br>Jim Rowan was born and raised in Bridgeton where he attended St Mungo&#39;s Academy. He was mostly a part time player who worked initially as a toolmaker and latterly for a finance company. When he left football he built up a successful publican&#39;s business, particularly with the Horseshoe Bar in Airdrie till 1990 when he took early retirement. As a devoted family man, this enabled him to spend more time with them,enjoying visits to Australia and Canada to see daughters who had settled there. He also enjoyed playing golf at Bothwell Castle Golf Club where he was a member.<br><br>Former Celtic star, John Hughes, a good friend,commented, &quot;Jim was a lovely man, very caring and very helpful. Despite the brevity of his Celtic career,he remained a very big Celtic fan and used to say to me if he was in the house when an Old Firm game was on TV, he had to go out for a walk as he couldn&#39;t bear the tension! Also Jim was quite a religious man,involved with his church St John&#39;s in Uddingston where he lived and the St Vincent de Paul Society charity.&quot;<br><br>Jim Rowan died in Monklands Hospital after a short stay there.<br><br>He is survived by his wife Nan, daughters Elaine, Geraldine, Anne and Pauline and several grandchildren.<br><br>JACK DAVIDSON  <div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div>  </div><h3>  </h3><br></div>
