The country was coming to terms with the aftermath of the war, and this included Celtic. The war years were a shambles for Celtic, and sadly thing were to get worse for Celtic on the field even afterwards. It was a poor time for the club and Hugh had signed in amongst this.<br><br>He played in 3 league  games from season 1946-47 (v Queen of the South, Queen&#39;s Park and Third Lanark), and also played in a  Scottish Cup tie against Dundee, all games were played in January 1947. <br><br>In his debut, he had displaced the great Bobby Evans, and sustained a cut on his temple which required stitches but he still played the rest of the game despite blood trickling down his face, although he states he was taken off <i>[needs checked: was he taken off or not?]. </i>Celtic still won 2-0.<br><br>He played in the next game with a padded rugby helmet to protect his five stitches sustained from his debut, and maybe it brought him luck as Celtic won 3-1 v Queen&#39;s Park (with future Celtic great Ronnie Simpson in goal for Queen&#39;s Park that day). His next game was a 0-0 draw with Third Lanark.<br><br>Sadly, he is remembered most for the Scottish Cup game against Dundee for when Celtic were down, he hit a <i>trintler </i>into the hands of a puzzled &amp; thankful opposition goalkeeper: &quot;<i>Doherty&#39;s miss was the talk of the town!</i>&quot; Celtic were to lose 2-1.<br><br>The club tried to offer him financial terms to stay but he opted to return home instead after just four league &amp; Scottish Cup games. He still had much admiration &amp; respect for the club, and he retained fond memories:<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;I got on well with the  club, manager and trainers and was very proud to  wear the Celtic  jersey, and it was a great feeling going out to play at  Celtic Park. I  have fond memories of Glasgow and how well I was treated  by supporters,  the club and other players.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>He actually had a fair record, with two wins, one draw and just the one defeat (the defeat coming in the Scottish Cup to Dundee). This was at post-wartime which was an era that Celtic were generally very poor throughout, so he had a fair record at least to look back on.<br><br>Later he signed as a professional for Blackpool but taking in that they had just signed another an Outside-Right called &#39;<i>Stanley Matthews</i>&#39; then his chances were to be very limited, and he ended up deputising for him. <br><br>Blackpool loaned him to Raith Rovers in 1949 and he retired through injury during his time there.<br><br>On retiring from playing, he returned to Donegal, where he remained firmly involved in  football. He went on to make a major contribution  to grassroots football in the local area, and was still involved into his old age.<br><br>Those years of dedicated service were recognised by a number of  sporting organisations. In 2012, he was honoured by the Ulster Football  Association in appreciation for services to football. In 2013,  he was the recipient of the John Sherlock service to Football Award  2013, which was presented by the FAI at their all Ireland AGM. In February 2013, he was awarded The Donegal Sports Star Hall of Fame Award 2013 by FAI Chief Executive, John Delaney.  <br><br>A lot to admire about Hugh, and be proud that we can number him amongst the wider Celtic family.<br><br>He passed away in Sep 2014.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career </h3><font color="#333333"><i><b>  </b></i></font><div align="center"><div align="left"><font color="#333333"><i><b>  </b></i></font></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">SCOTTISH CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">EUROPE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">TOTAL</font></b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">1946-47</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">3</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">4</td></tr><tr><td align="center" width="16%"><font color="#333333">Goals</font></td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">0</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3>None<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Doherty%2C+Hugh+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Articles</h3><h3>  Happy Birthday to the oldest living Celt</h3>Celtic fc.net <br><br>http://www.celticfc.net/news/5817?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Celticfcnet+%28Celticfc.net%29<br><br>By: Mark Henderson on 05 May, 2014 09:57<br><br>HUGH Doherty may not be a household name among Hoops supporters but the Irishman has strong claims to be the oldest-living Celtic player. And today, May 5, the Buncrana Bhoy, who made four competitive first-team appearances for Celtic in the 1946/47 season, is celebratng his 93rd birthday.<br><br>And everyone at Celtic would like to wish Hugh a very happy birthday.<br><br>His Celtic career may have been fleeting, but Hugh will always be proud and privileged to have worn the Hoops. And had it not been for the onset of World War Two, the outside right may have become a more celebrated figure in Paradise.<br><br>&ldquo;Celtic&rsquo;s chief scout was visiting Portrush, on holiday in 1939 and saw me playing football in a pre-season trial match in Coleraine,&rdquo; Doherty told the Celtic View. &ldquo;He never spoke to me on that occasion, but I received a letter from Celtic Park inviting me over for a trial a few weeks later.<br><br>&ldquo;I played in an exhibition game (not the full Celtic side as some other hopefuls were there on trial as well) on September 1, 1939 at against Vale of Leven. After the game, the coach asked me to go to Celtic Park the following morning to discuss terms if I was interested.<br><br>&ldquo;Before this meeting, my father and I heard on the radio in their digs that England had declared war on Germany.<br><br>&ldquo;We arrived at Celtic Park and spoke to manager Willie Maley. He told my father (John Doherty) that due to the announcement of war, the situation had changed and he couldn&rsquo;t be responsible for my safety. We travelled back to Ireland and I spent the war years working on father&rsquo;s business and playing amateur football.&rdquo;<br><br>Having spent the duration of the war starring for Derry City and Dundalk, Doherty must have felt his opportunity of playing for the Bhoys had ended. But when a number of Celtic first-team players descended on Donegal on holiday, he was handed a second shot at the big time. <br><br>&ldquo;Some of the Celtic players were on holiday in Buncrana after the war and I played in an exhibition game with them,&rdquo; said Doherty. &ldquo;Tommy Bogan (capped for Scotland and later a player with Manchester United) was one of the players. Subsequently, I was contacted by Jimmy McGrory for a trial and went to play for Celtic after the war in 1946.&rdquo;<br><br>Doherty made his debut at home to Queen of the South and swiftly showed his commitment to the cause by playing on despite sustaining a serious head wound, which would later require stitches.<br><br>&rdquo;The first senior game I played in was between Celtic and Queen of the South in Dumfries, I was carried off with a head injury,&rdquo; he recalled.<br><br>&ldquo;A ball came across from the left and beat the keeper. The left-back tried to hook the ball at the same time as I tried to head it into the net. I had stitches in my head but played in the next game with a padded rugby helmet.&rdquo; <br><br>The post-war years were a turbulent time in Paradise as the club struggled for consistency and silverware proved elusive. Still, it didn&rsquo;t mean there was a deficiency in talent.<br><br>&ldquo;At that time, there were a lot of changes as players were coming back from the war but I played with many great Celtic players at that time,&rdquo; said Doherty.<br><br>&ldquo;My own position was outside-right and I played with great goalkeeper and Scottish international Willie Miller, full-back Bobby Hogg, was the oldest player on the team, who was playing his last season in football. I remembered him from the pre-war days as well.<br><br>&ldquo;Matt Lynch, a school teacher, filled in, and there were also promising young players like Bobby Evans, Willie Corbett who was a sound centre half, Roy Milne at left-back; and Jimmy Mallon at right-back.<br><br>&ldquo;George Haslett. who later went south to play for Leeds United, and Willie Gallacher who was the son of Patsy Gallacher, then there was Gerry McAloon, who travelled up every weekend from London to play and was a very good provider to have on the wing.<br><br>&ldquo;At centre-forward was Joe Rae while Pat O Sullivan outside left and Rolando Ugolini (who sadly passed away recently), a Scottish-Italian and another great goalkeeper who was kept out of the position by the great Willie Miller. His family had a fish and chip shop in Bathgate, and eventually he moved to play for Middlesbrough.&rdquo;<br><br>Like a number of his contemporaries at the club, though, Doherty was soon on the move, eventually signing for English side Blackpool.<br><br>Providing competition for his position on the wing at the Seasiders was one the game&rsquo;s all-time greats &ndash; Sir Stanley Matthews.<br><br>&ldquo;Jimmy McGrory was a very fair and upfront manager and I received a very nice letter from him when I left Celtic,&rdquo; said Doherty.<br><br>&ldquo;I got on well with the club, manager and trainers and was very proud to wear the Celtic jersey, and it was a great feeling going out to play at Celtic Park. I have fond memories of Glasgow and how well I was treated by supporters, the club and other players.<br><br>&ldquo;There were a few clubs interested in me when I left Celtic, and I was offered a good contract at Blackpool in 1947/48. I played outside-right, the same position as the great Stanley Matthews and deputised on the odd game when he was injured or playing for England.<br><br>&ldquo;He was considered to be the best player in the world at that time and I was delighted to have an opportunity to play in the same team as him.<br><br>&ldquo;I remember playing in Europe and getting a good write-up after a game in Copenhagen. After a goal I scored in the fourth game in Odense, Matthews said to me, &lsquo;Great goal, you didn&rsquo;t hit the corner flag with that one!&rsquo;<br><br>While it was always going to be difficult displacing the magnificent Matthews, it was eventually a serious injury that cut short Doherty&rsquo;s playing time and ultimately his career at the top level.<br><br>&ldquo;After I had a great game against Blackburn Rovers, John Bruton (manager) tried to negotiate a transfer for me to his team, which I only found out about this later,&rdquo; he said.<br><br>&ldquo;I played a season with Blackpool before damaging the cartilage in my knee. I was operated on, and in the following season playing a match between Blackpool and Aston Villa, I damaged ligaments in the same knee.<br><br>&ldquo;The injury was more serious than they first thought and I broke down on a number of comebacks. Blackpool made a settlement with me because of the seriousness of the injuries, and I went back to digs in Scotland. I continued training with Clyde and was great friends with their manager, the former Celt, Paddy Travers.<br><br>&ldquo;After a friendly, Raith Rovers were impressed and asked me to play but I broke down during the game, and I had to accept that the specialist was correct and I couldn&rsquo;t play senior football again.&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I have never been back to Celtic or Blackpool but I have followed them keenly throughout my life,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I received a lovely letter from both clubs and the FAI on my 90th Birthday. Celtic invited me back to the Directors&rsquo; Box to view a game but I wasn&rsquo;t well enough to take up the offer at the time.&rdquo;<br><br>On returning to his native Donegal, Doherty remained firmly involved in football, playing for several teams before making a major contribution to grassroots football in the local area following his retirement.

He was 93.<br><br>The Buncrana Bhoy made four competitive appearances for the Hoops in the 1946/47 season, before joining Blackpool, where he vied with Sir Stanley Matthews for a place on the wing.<br><br>Hugh made his debut at home to Queen of the South and immediately underlined his commitment to the cause by playing on with a serious head wound, which would later require stitches. His stay in Glasgow may have been fleeting but he was always proud and privileged to have worn the Hoops.<br><br>A serious injury that he sustained at Blackpool cut short his career and the Irishman returned to his native Donegal, where he remained firmly involved in the game he loved, turning out for a number of local teams.<br><br>After his retirement, he made a major contribution to grassroots football, and his years of dedicated service to the game saw him recognised by a number of sporting organisations, including the Ulster Football Association, the FAI and the Donegal Sports Star Hall of Fame.  <b><br></b><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>Oct 2014</h3><img align="bottom" alt="Doherty, Hugh - The Celtic Wiki" height="1136" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/67d161c9ff57114f75edad8579179ffd/GW452H1136" title="Doherty, Hugh - The Celtic Wiki" width="452"><br><br></div>
