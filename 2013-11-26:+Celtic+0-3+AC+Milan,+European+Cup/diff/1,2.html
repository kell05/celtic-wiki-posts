AC Milan deserved to win, there&#39;s no doubt about it. Their passing, control and movement were far superior to Celtic&#39;s and not even a poor ref deflects from that. My thoughts on each of our players:</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Forster &ndash; Not commanding enough but I wouldn&#39;t blame him for any of the goals conceded.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Lustig &amp; Izaguirre &ndash; Played very well, only ones who come away with true credit.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Ambrose &amp; Van Dijk &ndash; Shaky, particularly VVD who had his worst performance since Kazakhstan. Culpable for 2 goals and missed vital chance to get back into the game.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Forrest &ndash; Not sure if recent off-field situation has affected him mentally but completely anonymous. Worried about his regression at this stage.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Boerrigter &ndash; Good first half but gradually faded. Still quite hasn&rsquo;t lived up to expectations upon signing.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Mulgrew &ndash; Far too slow and lost the ball too frequently. When his set plays fail, as has been case recently, he doesn&#39;t offer much else</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Kayal &ndash; Solid if unspectacular. However his terrible attempt for our first chance of the game was predictable. You can&rsquo;t help but wish Wanyama had been out there instead.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Commons &ndash; Lack of cohesion in team generally didn&rsquo;t help but didn&rsquo;t get into the game at all and when he did, his complete lack of pace exposed him.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Samaras &ndash; As already stated in his thread, incompetent but far from the most culpable. Agree that his performances in UCL, compared to last season, have rapidly declined.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">3 Subs = All rather anonymous</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The defending for all Milan&#39;s goals were atrocious, especially their first two. Can&#39;t believe we used zonal marking and allowed Kaka to get a free header on goal. We badly missed Brown&#39;s drive last night, yet his absence was entirely of his own stupid making. The game was eerily reminiscent of the Juventus tie last season ergo majority of possession but tactically outclassed, this campaign is the first time we&rsquo;ve ever lost 2/3 UCL home games, we&#39;ll finish with our lowest ever UCL points tally bar a Camp Nou win and it was our joint worst home defeat in our European history - along with Juve and PSG in 1995.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">While the Rossoneri possess 4 class acts in Kaka, Balotelli, Montolivo and De Jong; we should have competed a lot better than we did. Milan are 13th, have made their worst start to Serie A for 32 years, won 0 of their 6 away games in the league and won none of their last 7 consecutive games before last night - with 1 clean sheet in that 7 game spell. Perhaps we underestimated them due to their recent crisis but while objectively I can admit Celtic are the worst team in our group, both Milan and Ajax were at their weakest in some time and we just couldn&#39;t capitalise on that.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">All in all I think we collectively need to take a reality check at where we are. This is a workman like Celtic team that can defy the odds, but has severe flaws and is worse than last season despite raking in tens of millions. Quite simply, we are not as good as we think we are. In our group, we&#39;ve scored 2 goals in 5 games - 1 penalty and 1 deflected shot. Since August we have kept 1 clean sheet in our last 15 games, including 0 in our last 8 consecutive games. That is even more depressing when it&#39;s widely acknowledged our defence is Celtic&#39;s strongest position i.e. the majority of MOTM selections on KDS have been for defenders. In the crucial tie to actually qualify in the first place, Shakhter Karagandy were 1 Matthews mis-clearance off the line away from knocking us out. That we needed to turn around a 2-0 loss in Kazakstan should have been a dangerous indicator of things to come. In our 5 group games, we&rsquo;ve amassed a grand total of 14 shots on target throughout 8 hours of football and obtained an average of 38% possession per game: with only a trip to the Camp Nou to come, speaking of which kudos to Mes Que Un Club FC for the sterling professionalism they displayed in Amsterdam.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">As for the men upstairs. I&#39;m sorry doing everything on the cheap didn&#39;t prevail this time but I guess we can&#39;t have everything in life. I suppose the lack of co-efficient points, thus millions, garnered this campaign can be yet another excuse for the rejection of the living wage. Worth noting that both of the 2 strikers we did sign in the summer, for approximately &pound;4million combined, weren&#39;t among 3 subs trusted to come off the bench last night. Even die-hard advocates of &#39;the model&#39; would concede that&#39;s a clear sign of failure on the scouting network&#39;s behalf. In general, failing to replace our best midfielder and best striker was negligent at best and criminal at worse. Still 3IAR is secured and the balance sheet is pristine. Anyone got any other jibes about washed up comedians to distract the more subservient tims among us?</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Despite the board&#39;s failings, Neil Lennon can&#39;t be absolved of all responsibility. His tactics have left a lot to be desired in the Champions League this time round, even if the league form has improved from last year. Questions about whether he is firm enough in his demand for a better quality of signing or accusations of being a PLC puppet may be harsh but have some foundation based on recent events. Undoubtedly the majority of us are not satisfied with the brand of football being played and favouritism with certain players no matter what. Such blind spots definitely remind me of both Celtic managers he served under. Speaking of which it&#39;s interesting that MON and WGS&rsquo;s worst UCL campaigns were in their final seasons in charge, particularly WGS overseeing an elimination from Europe with a game to spare... I wouldn&#39;t rule out this being Lennon&#39;s final season, but I think he has at least 1 extra season left in him and I fear for the calibre of manager that would replace him.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Sunday&#39;s trip to Tynecastle is pivotal as defeat = season over with 5 months of nothing to look forward to bar planning the date of clinching a 1 horse race with several games to spare. Regardless of the Hearts result, last night&#39;s disappointment could be an opportunity to give more opportunities to Pukki, Rogic, Balde, Biton et al, as The Human Torpedo articulated. As for the future, we must seriously reevaluate and properly plan for next summer because harsh lessons must be learned, although history under the stewardship of Peter Lawwell suggests we won&#39;t.  </span><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><span class="diffRemove">[...]</span><span class="diffAdd">  </span><h3><span class="diffAdd">Celtic</span></h3><span class="diffAdd">  </span><ul><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">01 Forster </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">23 Lustig </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">03 Izaguirre Booked </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">21 Mulgrew </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">04 Ambrose </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">05 van Dijk Booked </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span class="diffAdd">49 Forrest (Rogic - 80&#39;

Goals by Kaka, Cristian Zapata and Mario Balotelli consigned Celtic to a margin of defeat which equalled the heaviest they have ever suffered at home in their European history.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Group H, uniquely comprised of four former European champions, has simply proved too hot for Neil Lennon&rsquo;s squad to handle. When the draw was made, the manager had expressed the hope they would not be the &ldquo;runts of the litter&rdquo; but they have been unable to match the pedigree of their three illustrious rivals.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Ajax&rsquo;s 2-1 win over Barcelona last night saw even the potential consolation prize of a place in the last 32 of the Europa League removed from Celtic&rsquo;s grasp. They will now finish bottom of the group, irrespective of the outcome of their final game against Barcelona in the Nou Camp in a fortnight.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Much of Lennon&rsquo;s pre-match thinking had been occupied by the need to increase Celtic&rsquo;s attacking potency, having seen them draw a blank in front of goal in three of their four previous outings in the group. But as he put together a strategy which invested the advanced areas of his team with the additional pace of Derk Boerrigter and James Forrest, he would certainly not have been legislating for the degree of sloppiness at the other end of the pitch which gave Milan their 13th minute opener and undermined what had been a bright start to the match by the home side.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">On an evening when concentration levels required to be at their maximum for Celtic, their lack of defensive focus at the opening goal was difficult to credit. Valter Birsa&rsquo;s corner kick from the right found Kaka unmarked on the edge of the six yard box, the Brazilian playmaker barely having to jump as he guided a simple header beyond Fraser Forster.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Whether the goalkeeper was at fault for failing to come and cut out the delivery, or central defender Virgil van Dijk was more culpable for leaving Kaka unattended, it was a desperately poor goal for Celtic to lose.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It deflated the initial buoyancy of the crowd who had responded with typical raucousness to their team&rsquo;s early efforts to keep Milan on the back foot. Boerrigter had a chance to validate his first European starting appearance for Celtic when a Charlie Mulgrew corner after just two minutes found him in space at the back post, but the Dutch winger was unable to connect cleanly enough with his volley.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati appeared unconvincing in dealing with cross balls during that early spell. He flapped badly at another Mulgrew corner, but was bailed out by his captain Riccardo Montolivo&rsquo;s alertness before any Celtic player could take advantage.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Beram Kayal then had a clear sight of goal for Celtic when a Mulgrew shot broke into his path inside the penalty area but the Israeli midfielder could not get the ball out of his feet quickly enough and the chance went begging.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Kaka&rsquo;s opener for Milan took the sting out of Celtic&rsquo;s work for a period, while news of Ajax taking the lead against Barcelona in the other Group H fixture cast further gloom on proceedings.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It almost got worse for Lennon&rsquo;s men when Mario Balotelli, playing on the shoulder of Efe Ambrose to avoid being caught offside, burst clear on the end of a rapid counter attack by Milan and drove a shot narrowly over the top. Kaka then curled a 20-yard shot just wide of Forster&rsquo;s left-hand post as Milan threatened to take complete control.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic were forced into a change on the half-hour mark, Kayal&rsquo;s injury woes resurfacing as he limped off to be replaced by Joe Ledley. The closing stages of the first half saw Celtic try and ramp up the pressure on Milan but they struggled to find the necessary penetration in and around the visitors&rsquo; penalty area.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">A rare mistake by Montolivo did present them with one decent opportunity, Kris Commons helping the ball into Mulgrew&rsquo;s path, but his low shot from around 16 yards was too close to Abbiati who saved comfortably.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic&rsquo;s prospects of reviving their Champions League ambitions all but disintegrated completely within the first five minutes of the second half as they missed a glorious chance to equalise and then almost immediately conceded another goal as a consequence of dismal defending at a set piece.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Van Dijk should have atoned for his part in the first goal when, after a Joe Ledley free kick in the 47th minute was blocked by the Milan defence, the Welsh midfielder seized on the rebound and floated a perfect cross to the far post.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It found van Dijk in splendid isolation with only Abbiati to beat from around eight yards, but the big Dutchman tamely directed his volley straight into the grateful clasp of the goalkeeper.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Two minutes later, Milan fully punished Celtic as they doubled their lead.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It was another defensive nightmare for the home team who were woefully unresponsive as Birsa delivered a corner from the right. Antonio Nocerino, who had just replaced the injured Ignazio Abate, had all the time he wanted to slide the ball low back across the penalty area for Colombian defender Cristian Zapata to touch it home almost on the line.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic thought they had pulled a goal back in the 51st minute when van Dijk headed in a Ledley cross from close range but the celebrations were cut short when he was correctly flagged offside.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It was becoming pure torment for Celtic now and their agony was intensified when Milan made it 3-0 on the hour mark.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">This time it was a long ball from inside the visitors&rsquo; half by Montolivo which caught out the Celtic defence, Balotelli easily holding off Ambrose&rsquo;s challenge to surge into the area and beat Forster with a close range right-foot shot.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Forrest and Samaras missed decent chances to put a more respectable sheen on the scoreline for Celtic but Milan generally saw out the closing stages with comfort on what had proved to be a chastening evening for Lennon&rsquo;s players.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic: Forster, Lustig, Ambrose, Van Dijk, Izaguirre; Kayal (Ledley 30), Mulgrew; Forrest (Rogic 80), Commons (Stokes 65), Boerrigter; Samaras.

was proved correct as they ran out comfortable winners.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Their opener was a goal of infuriating simplicity from Celtic&#39;s point of view, with the hitherto exemplary Virgil van Dijk guilty of a total loss of concentration.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">As Valter Birsa curled in a corner, Van Dijk drifted off Kaka, who was left to head unchallenged past Fraser Forster from six yards out.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The visitors&#39; second also found the Celtic defence wanting, again from a Birsa corner, which was knocked back across goal by Antonio Nocerino and over the line by the lurking Zapata.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">A dejected Celtic side realise their 2013-14 European journey is over</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">A dejected Celtic side realise their 2013-14 European journey is over</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">A night to forget for the Celtic defence was made even worse when a straight-forward ball over the top from Riccardo Montolivo beat both Van Dijk and Efe Ambrose, allowing Balotelli to slide the ball past Forster.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">The timing of the first two goals was particularly galling as each one followed glaring misses by the home side.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Beram Kayal hesitated slightly right in front of goal before slicing wide under pressure from Zapata moments before Kaka headed the Italians in front.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And just before Zapata&#39;s tap-in, Van Dijk, presented with a glorious opportunity to make amends for his earlier lapse, volleyed straight at Abbiati from six yards when anywhere else on target would surely have meant an equaliser.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">And when Van Dijk finally looked to have restored a bit of pride by heading past Abbiati to reduce the deficit, he was judged offside.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Celtic&#39;s only other efforts of any great note came from Charlie Mulgrew, who shot tamely into Abbiati&#39;s arms, and James Forrest, who poked the ball just wide of the post with the game already lost.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">It was a timid end to a night that had begun so full of promise for Celtic as Milan went some way to restoring their damaged reputation and pride.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">For Neil Lennon, it leaves just the league title - already a foregone conclusion - and the Scottish Cup to play for.</span><br><br><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Live Text Commentary</span><br><span class="diffAdd">Full time</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Full Time Match ends, Celtic 0, Milan 3.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">90:00 +3:00 Full time</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 0, Milan 3.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">90:00 +2:35</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Foul by Mikael Lustig (Celtic).</span><br><span class="diffAdd">90:00 +2:35</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Mario Balotelli (Milan) wins a free kick in the defensive half.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">90:00 +1:09</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">(Celtic) wins a free kick in the defensive half.</span><br><span class="diffAdd">90:00 +1:09</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Foul by Antonio Nocerino (Milan).</span><br><span class="diffAdd">89:57</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Attempt missed.
