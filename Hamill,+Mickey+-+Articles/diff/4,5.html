In the next two seasons,  Hamill played almost 60 games for the Red Devils, starring in front of  crowds at the newly constructed Old Trafford stadium.<br><br>Around this time, Hamill received his first cap for Ireland in his new position of Centre Half.<br><br>In  1914, he Captained his country to their first ever Home Championship  victory, beating England 3-0 at Middlesborough&rsquo;s Ayrsome Part and  drawing 1-0 with the Scots at home in Belfast.<br><br>In a later match  against Scotland, in 1919, Mickey would infuriate home fans at Hampden  by bellowing &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo;s ball&rsquo; each time the game was stopped for a throw  in or corner.<br><br>Later, he would refuse to play for Ireland,  complaining bitterly about the treatment of Catholic players chosen, or  in many cases not chosen, to wear the green.<br><br>Soon, his time at  Manchester United would end. In his second season, a row broke out over a  benefit match Mickey claimed was to be arranged for him.<br><br>He  walked out on United and returned home to Belfast Celtic, where a  loophole known as the &lsquo;open door&rsquo;, meant Celtic got their greatest asset  on a free transfer.<br><br>This led to a legal row, as no agreement  existed over football transfers between England and Ireland. Shortly  afterwards, the two associations agreed to close the &lsquo;open door&rsquo;,  settling on a transfer agreement between England and Ireland.<br><br>Back  to business in Belfast, Mickey went on to lead Belfast Celtic to their  first league championship win since 1901, in the 1914-15 season. This  was also the first season the Belfast Celts adopted the Hooped jerseys  of their Glasgow cousins.<br><br>The keen eye of Willie Maley once again  drifted from Glasgow towards Belfast and he sent for Mickey to help his  quest for the title in 1916, where he also helped Celtic secure the  Charity Cup.<br><br>Back in Belfast, in the midst of the world war and  the wake of the Easter rising, the Irish League limped on without  Belfast Celtic, who refused to enter a senior team in a time of warfare.<br><br>In  the intermediate league, Mickey Hamill captained the side to the  championship, as other junior teams complained bitterly that they could  not cope against clubs who had a player of the calibre of Hamill and his  recently recruited partner Jimmy Ferris.<br><br>It was at this time, as  the guns of Flander&rsquo;s battlefields prepared to fall silent, that  Belfast Celtic had its greatest triumph up until that time.<br><br>Celtic  had already clocked up league victories by this stage, as well as  collecting a number of other cups, but their key prize had always eluded  them. <br><br>At the meeting which established the club in 1891, James  Keenan, the Chairman, suggested the name &lsquo;Belfast Celtic &lsquo;should be  adopted; &ldquo;After our Glasgow friends and that our aim should be to  imitate them in their style of play, win the Irish Cup, and follow their  example, especially in the cause of Charity.&rdquo;<br><br>So in the founding  statement of the team, the winning of the Irish Cup was paramount &ndash; and  this was the one honour that had eluded the team ever since, with three  previous finals seeing three defeats for the Stripes.<br><br>That was to change in 1918, when a replay against Linfield saw a 2-0 victory deliver the Cup to Paradise for the first time.<br><br>Mickey  Hamill was described as being &lsquo;particularly majestic in defence&rsquo;,  despite dealing with a &lsquo;huge gash&rsquo; in his leg, while Norman Stewart took  the laurels, scoring a brace of goals.<br><br>Another league title followed in 1920, but the onset of the Anglo-Irish war cast dark clouds over Belfast.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s  Chairman, Dan McCann, was the target for an assassination attempt from  the RUC murder gang led by District Inspector Nixon and threats were  made to other officials, as well as Celtic fans travelling to games.<br><br>The decision was made to withdraw the club from football, along with Dublin clubs Bohemians and Shelbourne.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s  players were scattered across various leagues, with Hamill&rsquo;s partner  Jimmy Ferris finding himself at Chelsea, while Mickey himself was back  in Manchester, but this time in the blue half of the city.<br><br>&pound;2000  had secured his services and in the next four years at Maine Road,  Hamill would run out 128 times and was even picked for England to play  in a league representative match against Scotland as part of the post  war victory celebrations.<br><br>In 1924, the wandering Hamill made his  most intrepid move, going transatlantic to the USA to compete in the  newly formed American Soccer League for Massachusetts club Fall River  Marksmen.<br><br>He moved again, helping the brilliantly titled Boston  Wonder Workers to a second place league finish in 1926, before finishing  off at the New York Giants soccer club.<br><br>He left an indelible  mark on the football community stateside, so much so that he was invited  to the White House in Washington to meet the President of the United  States, along with other sporting icons at the time, such as Baseball  legend Babe Ruth.<br><br>A special medal was also minted in his honour  by the US Soccer Association, which remains in the possession of the  Hamill family.<br><br>Despite all the American adulation, Belfast called  and in 1927, Mickey and his family returned to the old sod. It was  expected that he would slip happily into retirement after a wanderlust  career at the age of 37, but Belfast Celtic had other ideas.<br><br>A club delegation sought him out and he was once again persuaded to join the green and white.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s  Directors knew Mickey was &lsquo;box office&rsquo; and even staged a weekend series  of testimonial events for his benefit, the biggest of which was a  boxing tournament.<br><br>When the ticket receipts rolled in, Hamill found himself &pound;1,000 richer!<br><br>Author  Mark Kennedy notes that; &ldquo;Although older and slower, Mickey still  played with poise and control&hellip;his long deliberate passes were like manna  for the wingers.&rdquo;<br><br>Three consecutive league titles followed, as  well as several friendly encounters with the &lsquo;Glasgow friends&rsquo;, before  Mickey finally hung up his boots, aged 40 years old.<br><br>Now a father  with a young family, Mickey had gone into business on his return from  the USA, like many footballers, in the drinks trade, opening the Centre  Half Bar on the Falls Road, a popular hangout for both players and fans.<br><br>The  official Belfast Celtic match programme, The Celt, often carried  adverts for the establishment, with one poem extolling that &lsquo;Once you&rsquo;ve  paid a visit, you&rsquo;ll come back and have a jar and spend a pleasant hour  or two in Mickey Hamill&rsquo;s bar.&rsquo;<br><br>Mickey continued to take a keen  interest in Belfast Celtic. He also managed local rivals Distillery in  1934 and represented Derry City at the Irish Football Association in the  mid-1930&rsquo;s.<br><br>At the inquest into his death, it was revealed that  Hamill had been on his way to work in Lisburn, where he&rsquo;d taken a  wartime occupation as a sheet metal worker, when he was last seen.<br><br>Dr  Johnston, who had examined Hamill&rsquo;s body, insisted to the court that he  had lain in the river for several days, but this was disputed by a  friend, William Barr of Dromore, who said Mickey had been at his home  for dinner two nights before.<br><br>Hamill&rsquo;s brother in law, Patrick  McKenna, told Deputy Coroner Dr. DC Lennie that Mickey; &ldquo;Had no worries  of any kind and was a popular man!&rdquo;<br><br>Lennie returned an open verdict on the death and the mystery of his last hours remains unsolved. <br><br>In  the wake of his death, the Irish News carried front page headlines on  the Allies pounding Crete as part of their Mediterranean offensive and  reports that Benito Mussolini had resigned in Italy and was possibly  under arrest.<br><br>And there among the stories of the shifting sands  of world slaughter sat the sad tale of Mickey Hamill&rsquo;s funeral from St  Peter&rsquo;s Cathedral in Belfast.<br><br>The first line of the report said;  &ldquo;One of the greatest manifestations of public sympathy seen in Belfast  for years was witnessed yesterday for the funeral of Mr Michael &lsquo;Mickey&rsquo;  Hamill.&rdquo;<br><br>No less than 180 personalities, dignitaries,  politicians, sportsmen, businessmen and clergy who attended the funeral  are listed as attending.<br><br>13 priests officiated his funeral mass  and amongst the names listed sits &lsquo;J Davey&rsquo;, the Belfast Celtic scribe  and Hamill&rsquo;s school friend, &lsquo;Ben Madigan&rsquo;, whose Irish News column on  the morning after the funeral began with; &ldquo;To none more than myself did  the news at the weekend of the death of Mickey Hamill come as a more  stunning blow!&rdquo;<br><br>In 1989, a full 46 years after his death, a  television documentary on the history of Belfast Celtic marked Mickey as  the club&rsquo;s greatest ever player.<br><br>Veteran journalist Malcolm  Brodie, long regarded as the doyen of Irish soccer journalism, related  that he had written a series on great Irish footballers years before for  the Belfast Telegraph where he interviewed those players from that era.<br><br>Their choice as their most impressive peer - and as Ireland&rsquo;s greatest ever player - was unanimously Mickey Hamill.<br><br>Brodie, a Scotsman not known for overstatement, dubbed Hamill; &lsquo;The George Best of the 20&rsquo;s&rsquo;.<br><br>Jackie  Mahood, a team mate from that era, who formed a famous and deadly &lsquo;Two  Mahood&rsquo; forward partnership with his brother Stanley, later described  Mickey as being; &ldquo;So graceful he was like one of them trotting ponies&rdquo;.<br><br>Mahood  remembered that Hamill&rsquo;s physical fitness and physique was unreal, with  a stomach like; &ldquo;Four tennis balls and&hellip;whipchord muscle all over!&rdquo;<br><br>Another scibe believed that; &ldquo;As a half-back, Hamill was peerless and tireless!&rdquo;<br><br>Seventy  years on from his tragic death, those who never had the pleasure of  gazing on him at work at the Paradises of both Glasgow and Belfast, are  in no position to argue.<br>What is certain, in all the old haunts Mickey called his own, no matter where in the world he settled, his ghost lingers on.<br><br>There&rsquo;s  an old saying in the green and white half of Belfast, that &lsquo;When we had  nothing, we had Belfast Celtic &ndash; and then we have everything.&rdquo;<br><br>To the destitute poor of the Pound Loney and Falls Road districts of the city, Hamill meant everything to them. <br><br>Mickey was their idol - &lsquo;The Darling of the Falls&rsquo;<br><br><h3>Annette McWilliams</h3><img align="bottom" alt="Hamill, Michael - Pic" height="906" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/VaODODCM_duISYI9bWrrng135269/GW1024H906" title="Hamill, Michael - Pic" width="1024"><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Was           Mickey Hamill Belfast Celtic&rsquo;s Greatest Player?</h3><h3><img align="right" alt="Hamill, Michael - Pic" height="150" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/PyE0vk6YGpFOPCwwkNe_OQ4400/GW100H150" title="Hamill, Michael - Pic" width="100"></h3><font color="#000000"><b><i><font face="Arial" size="2">by           Fra Coogan</font></i></b>     </font><br>source: http://www.belfastceltic.org/archive/hamill.html<br><br>This     story is about one of Belfast Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever players &ndash;  Mickey   Hamill. My interested was aroused when I received a letter from  Mr Pat   Cassidy who lives in Causeway Street, Portrush. Mickey was  born in   Leeson Street down the Falls Road, the second youngest of a  family of   six, John, Pat, Joe and two sisters, Susan and Minnie. <br><br>Mickey                  attended school at Barrack Street and Harding Street  and it   was               mostly Gaelic games he played.              I  intend   to tell you about his time spent with the two                great   Manchester sides and his seeming inability to stay any                  length of time in one place; he definitely had a touch of                  wanderlust in him.               Mickey&rsquo;s               first  teams  were  St Paul&rsquo;s, Swifts and Belfast Rangers and it                looked  at  one time as if he was going to sign for Distillery but                  Celtic jumped in and soon he was a regular &lsquo;seconds&rsquo; team                  player. <br><br>On a Good Friday in 1909 he got a run out  in the  senior                side against Bohemians at inside right and  made  the spot  his own. Christmas         1910 saw him give an  exhibition in a  holiday  game against Glasgow Celtic         after  which a Man Utd  representative  stepped in and signed him. On          December 31,  United paid Celtic  &pound;175 for his signature and a clause  was          added that &lsquo;United&rsquo;  agree to play at Celtic Park in the  Easter          period of 1911. <br><br>Pat          Cassidy states that  Mickey could  not fit into the big city and  had         trouble  acquiring lodgings.  Pat claims the nuns in Belfast  and          Manchester placed him with  temporary rooms with his great  grandparents          in St. Patrick&rsquo;s  parish in North Manchester. <br><br>Mickey           became attached to  the Ball family and Bartle Ball, the head of   the         house, claimed  Mickey became like a brother to his   grandmother Catherine         Ball  and her six brothers and sisters.  Pat  says he believed Mickey          returned to Belfast to avoid   conscription in 1914 but returned in 1920          to play for  Manchester  City. <br><br>Mickey         settled  happily again with the  Ball family  and a large photograph of          Mickey wearing his  International Cap  stayed in the house for many  years.         Mickey  was remembered with  great affection and Pat says  that his mother,          the daughter of  Catherine Ball, always spoke  of Mickey Hamill as  the &ldquo;George Best of his  day&rdquo;. <br><br>This          information was  given to Pat Cassidy by his  great aunt Dorothea Ball  who         died a  few years ago in her  nineties. Dorothea and her  husband Harry          were contemporaries of  Mickey Hamill and knew him  extremely well and  Pat         would dearly  love to find out more  about Mickey Hamill who  was like a         member  of his own family. <br><br>My          own  knowledge is practically nil  and when his name comes up in           footballing company no one seems  to know much more than his   association         with The Centre Half Bar  at the corner of Paton   Street and the fact that         he was rated  Celtic&rsquo;s greatest ever   player. That&rsquo;s a huge statement         when you  consider the likes of   Mc Alinden as F.A. Cup medal winner with          Portsmouth, Charlie   Tully, Bertie Fulton and a million more. I get the          impression   Mickey was a loner and despite the reputation he bears  I         think   that seven &lsquo;Caps&rsquo; is not a lot. He also had trouble  making the           Man United side where trainer Geordie Livingstone  told him he was  yards          too slow for the Englishman&rsquo;s faster paced  type of game.  He  made him         do 25-yard sprints until it seems  Mickey got sick  and  tired of training. <br><br>One         of Celtic&rsquo;s  all time great   wingers Stanley Mahood said he had never         seen a  finer or  fitter  athlete. Spectator&rsquo;s used to gaze in awe as he          skipped  on to  the pitch like a trotting pony, his stomach was like four            tennis balls and the rest pure muscle and whipcord. After the  war he           played a season for Glasgow Celtic and won a League and  Cup   medal. <br><br>He         then signed for Man City for &pound;2,000 a won a    Cup finalist medal. His         time at Maine Road was happy and the    media had him billed as the         &lsquo;World&rsquo;s Greatest&rsquo; centre half, a    huge accolade for an Irishman in         England. <br><br>The            wanderlust streak once again brought him back to his beloved Belfast            Celtic but Home Rule was on the boil and the sectarian strife   ruled  the         city. In 1925 he married a woman named Genevieve and   the  couple         immediately left for America where he played for   Forth  River,         Massachusetts. In no time he became an icon in the   same  mould as baseball legend Babe         Ruth and was even invited   to the  White House to meet the then President together with other   sporting  legends such as Babe Ruth himself. However he was soon back           in  Belfast, the year was 1926 and he retired in 1930 but had a   short          stint as manager of Distillery in August 1934. <br><br>A    few  knick-knacks on his career included leading Belfast Celtic to   their  first Irish Cup triumph against Linfield at Grosvenor Park on   April 4th  1918. He played for Ireland against Scotland in victory   International at  Ibrox Park on March 22 1919 and amused the crowd with   his yells of  &lsquo;Celtic&rsquo;s ball&rsquo; at throw ins. However the scribes in   Glasgow described  his playing ability as &ldquo;just quietly effective&rdquo;. The   only way I can give  an opinion on Hamill&rsquo;s ability is that my late   father always said  Hamill was the best player he ever saw &ndash; that will   do me. <br><br>                  On         a sad ending, Mickey   Hamill&rsquo;s body was taken from  the river Lagan at         Lisburn on 23   July 1943. I don&rsquo;t think any  verdict was ever reached on         this   accident. As I said, Mickey  Hamill lived a nomadic quiet existence           and all I can add is you  don&rsquo;t get to play for teams like Belfast   and         Glasgow Celtic,  Manchester United and Manchester City or   your country,         unless  you are one hell of a player. <br><br>No           matter what anyone  thinks, Mickey Hamill is ranked among the  all  time         greats and  that&rsquo;s how he is remembered &ndash; a legend.<br>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>                <img align="bottom" alt="Hamill, Mickey - Pic" height="708" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/AHFpHSbFnr7Nur2Srm2n_g71681/GW599H708" title="Hamill, Mickey - Pic" width="599"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Hamill, Mickey - Articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="657" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/361d45d3ab65baf70a0fde297626f36a/GW507H657" title="Hamill, Mickey - Articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="507"><br><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Hamill, Mickey - Articles - The Celtic Wiki" height="324" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/3397b3427658adf95c151ab96136cd35/GW599H324" title="Hamill, Mickey - Articles - The Celtic Wiki" width="599"><br></div>
