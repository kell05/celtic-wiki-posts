Sycophantic media writers such as Jim Traynor, Chic Young and Derek Johnstone have towed the line set by the Huns or even simply played up to them to curry favour. It can be described as &#39;shill&#39; coverage of the Huns. <br><br>The bankruptcy of Rangers was made possible by the convenient and self serving relationship between many media men and the Huns. It meant that all investigation was sidelined in fear of losing favour. To curry favour and to avoid potential ramifications from the Huns and their support, the media men acquiesced to the Huns demands (without even needing to be directed to do so much often) and this generated a great degree of hubris which led to Rangers self-destruction and death in 2012. <br><br>Any journalism that doesn&#39;t put the facts to scrutiny, plays to the gallery, has high levels of sycophancy or just portrays the subject in an unmerited high manner is practising succulent lamb journalism. Some even refer to it as <i>&#39;Succulent Lamb Syndrome</i>&#39;.<br><br>Journalist Graham Speirs likes to make claim that he was the one who began the satirical succulent lamb mocking following Jim Traynor&#39;s cringing article. Think he&#39;s giving himself a little too much credit for that, but he has been a highly vocal critic of the succulent lamb brigade (as he has put it) and for that we respect him. <br><br>His definition is quite a swipe at certain of his peers:<br><blockquote><i>&ldquo;Succulent lamb journalism  means a culture &ndash; and I hold my hand up here  too &ndash; a culture of  sycophantic, unquestioning, puff journalism that  went on around Rangers  generally and Sir David Murray particularly.&rdquo;</i><br><br></blockquote>In 2013, Alex Thompson (Channel 4 News) who had taken a strong interest in exposing the shill coverage, exposed the cosy and unacceptable relationship between Glasgow Media and Rangers with his expose on Jim Traynor. It was revealing and even surprising for what came out.<br><br>Away from the mockery, the serious side is that succulent lamb journalism has been to the detriment of Scottish football and tackling it has been vital. Sadly, there has been little to nothing done, with all the prime sycophants still remaining in their roles (or moved onto other notable roles) despite the collapse of Rangers and their negligence &amp; blind spot in their coverage of the events that led up to it. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Media" target="_self">Media</a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="post-title">Articles</h3>(The classic &quot;Succulent Lamb&quot; article)<br><h3 class="post-title">SECRET FEAR THAT DRIVES ME TO WIN 10 IN A ROW</h3>Daily Record &ndash; November 19, 1998<br><br>Exclusive James Traynor<br><br>Rangers  chairman David Murray opens up on the highs and lows of his decade in  charge of Rangers and promises that the best is still to come<br><br>RANGERS  owner David Murray doesn&#39;t often allow his true feelings to surface,  but currently he is finding it difficult to disguise a pain which has  been gnawing away inside since the end of last season.<br><br>After a  period of almost total dominance of Scottish football during which  Rangers racked up 17 trophies the club met with failure.<br><br>Celtic  won the championship and the League Cup and Hearts beat Rangers in the  Tennents Scottish Cup final, leaving Murray with nothing to show for a  massive investment in time and money.<br><br>Even now he winces when he  thinks of that season, but it is the vivid memory, and the pain of  defeat with which he now suffers, that combine to drive him on.<br><br>Last  night as he looked back on a decade as Rangers&#39; owner &ndash; come this  Sunday, the 22nd, it will be 10 years since he paid Lawrence Marlborough  &pound;6 million for the club &ndash; Murray&#39;s desire to avoid the miseries of  another barren season could not be disputed.<br><br>To hear him speak  was to listen to a man who believes himself to be charged with some kind  of great and mighty mission. Murray, who chose to talk only to the  Record about his dreams and ambitions for Rangers, said: &quot;No one should  doubt that Rangers are the biggest club in the country, but I know that  talk is cheap in this business and that we will have to prove just how  big we are.<br><br>&quot;That doesn&#39;t really bother me because as long as I  am able to influence this club we will be the biggest and we will be the  best. &quot;I have spent 10 years of my life, and I know that sometimes I  gave up too much of myself to Rangers, but I am not about to give up  now.<br><br>&quot;Neither am I willing to stand aside and allow another club  to overtake Rangers. The failure of last season hurt me a lot and that  pain was something I didn&#39;t need nor want.<br><br>&quot;It is also a pain  which I never want to suffer again, but by God that sort of thing just  makes me even more determined to succeed. I am still as driven, still as  enthusiastic and I will welcome the challenge of anyone out there.&quot;<br><br>Murray  was referring not only to the Kenny Dalglish/Jim Kerr consortium who  are stalking Celtic, but also the as yet uncovered groups who are bound  to make bids to buy out Fergus McCann.<br><br>If the past 10 years have  taught Murray, who is one of Britain&#39;s wealthiest individuals, anything  it is how to win and he believes Rangers will continue to grow and  prosper.<br><br>&quot;I look upon these last 10 years as a having been a  great era, but it is over and Rangers are about to head on into a new  era,&quot; he said over a glass of the finest red.<br><br><b>He was about to  take in another mouthful of the most succulent lamb &ndash; anyone who knows  Murray shouldn&#39;t be surprised to learn he is a full-blooded, unashamed  red meat eater &ndash; when he put down his knife and fork.</b><br><br>It was  like a statement of intent and looking directly across the table to make  sure I hadn&#39;t yet succumbed to the wine, he said:<br><br>&quot;Bring on the next 10 years, there&#39;s more to come for Rangers.<br><br>&quot;Understand  that I care passionately about what I&#39;m doing with Rangers and believe  that in 10 years time we will still be setting the pace.<br><br>&quot;Too many of us have put too much into this club and we won&#39;t let someone come along and take it all away.<br><br>&quot;What I&#39;m saying here is that no matter who buys Celtic from Fergus, they will need to have the deepest of pockets imaginable.<br><br>&quot;The  fresh challenge would be good for the Scottish game and lift the  profile, but Celtic&#39;s new owners had better be prepared to spend.<br><br>&quot;In  the past, Celtic&#39;s people maybe just haven&#39;t fancied trying to take  Rangers on financially, but if I have to go in deeper to keep my club up  there then I will. I have done it too many times to be frightened now.&quot;<br><br>From  anyone else such talk could be dismissed as no more than empty  rhetoric, but with Murray you just feel it is more than bluster and  besides, he does have a track record as a spender.<br><br>There have  been times in his 10 years when he has taken Rangers somewhere between  &pound;15m and &pound;20m into debt and he knows that if this season goes belly up  like the last one he could be looking at a potential debt of &pound;20m.  However, having taken the value of Rangers from &pound;6m to approximately  &pound;186m in 10 years he knows how far he can gamble in pursuit of success.<br><br>This season alone he has allowed his new manager Dick Advocaat to spend almost &pound;30m, but he refuses to lose any sleep over it.<br><br>He  said: &quot;I don&#39;t because I consider spending as much as &pound;5million on  someone like Andrei Kanchelskis as a necessity. If a club like ours  doesn&#39;t do that then we fall by the wayside.<br><br>&quot;Look, I have many  other businesses so I could find many other things to worry about, but I  love sport and I want Rangers to be successful. I know this won&#39;t be  accepted by some people but this isn&#39;t about making money. &quot;&pound;56m has  been invested in the stadium and in my time &pound;200m has been turned over  and after interest our trading profit is minimal. Perhaps as much as  &pound;60m has been spent on players and I have even paid in about &pound;1m in  hospitality but never taken a salary from the place.<br><br>&quot;I get six complimentary tickets the same as everyone else and if I want extra I have to pay for them the same as everyone else.<br><br>&quot;There  are no free lunches for David Murray at Ibrox and I have never taken  part or been at the centre of any of the numerous victory celebrations  we have had.&quot;<br><br>Murray disappears to celebrate success with a small  group of close friends, leaving the roar of the crowd to wash over the  players and management.<br><br>&quot;Supporters don&#39;t want chairmen hanging  around, even though they look to people like me to provide some kind of  direction and the new ways to keep moving the club on,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;I  hope I can say that in my 10 years so far I&#39;ve been fairly good at  that, but the day I run out of ideas is the day I&#39;ll know it&#39;s over. I&#39;m  sure someone will tell me because I have good people around me, I  always have.<br><br>&quot;But I&#39;m not ready yet to step back and I see enough  fresh challenges, staying ahead at home and winning a place at the  European table, ahead in the next 10 years to keep my own adrenaline  flowing.&quot;<br><br>He knows roughly how much it will cost him and he&#39;s  heard the rumours that ENIC, who have invested &pound;40m in Rangers, are  uneasy at the club&#39;s spending policies but Murray claims these backers  have always been supportive of his methods.<br><br>He said: &quot;They could  kick up a fuss but they don&#39;t. Besides, I am the owner of the club and  so far most people seem to like what I&#39;ve done.&quot;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>When Succulent Lamb is on The Menu &ndash; Serious Questions Are Off</h3>24 March 2012<br>http://blogs.channel4.com/alex-thomsons-view/succulent-lamb-menu-questions/1010<br>Alex Thomson<br><br>Right &ndash; let me make two things absolutely clear at the outset.<br><br>First,  I am writing this imagining that one or two people outside Glasgow use  the internet, so I might make some observations familiar to Clydeside  surfers.<br><br>Second, this arises from my continuing investigation  into Rangers which is still in early stages. That is to say, I am not  investigating Celtic. If I were, rest assured RFC Bears &ndash; they&rsquo;d get  just the same treatment.<br><br>I&rsquo;d expected the paranoia, insults, spin  etc &ndash; hey &ndash; this is &ldquo;fitba&rdquo; after all and I welcome it good, bad and  ugly, from fans within and without Glasgow. Indeed I&rsquo;ve gone out and  asked for it.<br><br>What I didn&rsquo;t expect were the insults (and in at  least one case a direct physical threat) not from fans but from Scottish  journalists.<br><br>Sarajevo, Mogadishu, Kabul, Islamabad, Tripoli,  Baghdad&hellip;I could bore you with more &ndash; in none of these places have I ever  got this interesting reaction from local journalists.<br><br>Only in Glasgow.<br><br>So something&rsquo;s up. Something&rsquo;s different.<br><br>Something  about asking questions about RFC clearly angers some in the Glasgow  media in a way I&rsquo;ve never seen in 25 years of global reporting.<br><br>Equally,  a number of fine Glasgow journalists have been incredibly helpful,  encouraging and agree there has been something deeply wrong for far too  long in the culture of reporting RFC.<br><br>They know who they are,  male and female, working in papers, radio and broadcasting and every  single one has encouraged me to dig around in an area many cannot, will  not or are prevented from, exploring.<br><br>I refer of course to &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo;. Graham Spiers, seasoned football writer in Glasgow was there the day it happened.<br><br>He  and other reporters dined with Sir David Murray &ndash; then RFC owner, in  the Channel Islands. Murray &ndash; as ever &ndash; was talking big on the Rangers  dream-theme, laying out plans for the club that seemed to go well beyond  the mere limit of the sky.<br><br>There duly appeared copy praising the &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo; that was eaten &ndash; the &ldquo;fine red&rdquo; that was drunk.<br><br>The food and drink were taken &ndash; so was this man&rsquo;s dream of Rangers &ndash; all without much question in some quarters.<br><br>I  make and imply no criticism at all of the reporters present &ndash; what  intrigues as an outsider is how many people years later around Glasgow  happily talk about &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo; journalism.<br><br>Let Graham  explain &ndash; he was actually there, after all: &ldquo;Succulent lamb journalism  means a culture &ndash; and I hold my hand up here too &ndash; a culture of  sycophantic, unquestioning, puff journalism that went on around Rangers  generally and Sir David Murray particularly.&rdquo;<br><br>Of course you&rsquo;ll  see it to some degree across sport, across football. But it was, many  Glasgow journalists say, more damaging here.<br><br>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; says Graham  Spiers, &ldquo;you are making a pact with the devil if you like. You get  thrown the best scraps. You get something for the back page or whatever.  But there&rsquo;s a tacit deal. You don&rsquo;t dig too deep. You don&rsquo;t cause any  trouble.&rdquo;<br><br>So Big Dave&rsquo;s dream was shouted across Glasgow. Fans  loved it. It shifted papers. Everyone (in blue) wanted in, needed to  believe. <br><br>So it went on &ndash; year after year. On one side the  directors at Scotland&rsquo;s football &ldquo;governing&rdquo; bodies didn&rsquo;t ask much. On  the other, large sections of Glasgow football journalism declined to  delve.<br><br>How else to explain Ibrox&rsquo;s boom to spectacular bust?<br><br>How  else to deal with the fact that when Craig Whyte took over it was  stories of a &ldquo;billionaire&rdquo; with &ldquo;off the scale riches&rdquo; that were pumped  out?<br><br>Ten minutes on Google or in Companies House could&rsquo;ve ended  that. But no. It was dreamland the fans wanted, dreamland much of the  media bought into and a club already financially crippled was about to  be further injured.<br><br>Legions of fans sold out again, as it would turn out.<br><br>Succulent  lamb culture has permeated to a degree that, as one prominent Glasgow  tabloid journalist put it: &ldquo;The press -a really critical check and  balance in the normal way of things, had been more or less destroyed in  Glasgow.&rdquo;<br><br>So are things any better today? Is succulent lamb off the menu &ndash; replaced with humble pie?<br><br>I leave it to others to judge if that succulent lamb cozy Glasgow football culture has really gone away.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="post-title">Rangers: succulent lamb on the rack?</h2>13 Feb 2013<br>Channel 4<br>http://blogs.channel4.com/alex-thomsons-view/succulent-lamb-rack/4144<br><br>Channel 4 News understands very well that sportswriters need close  relations with the football clubs they report on. But what follows  stands out because of the culture peculiar to Rangers FC and the media  during the reign of Sir David Murray and Craig Whyte.<br><br>It also stands out because it concerns a former reporter in that culture, who now runs the Rangers media operation.<br><br>In  response to last week&rsquo;s media coverage of Rangers&rsquo; disputed bills for  &pound;400,000 Rangers FC did not answer any of Channel 4 News&rsquo; questions  directly.<br><br>Instead the club website &ndash; now controlled by Ibrox  press boss James Traynor, attacked the media en masse, accusing them of  being &ldquo;at such a damning low&rdquo;: &ldquo;&hellip;it has become clear Rangers cannot rely  on basic honesty, decency or integrity from enough of the country&rsquo;s  media&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>It struck many appropriate that Mr Traynor should issue  such a rallying cry in defence of Rangers. For he stands as one example  of the curious Glasgow concept of &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo; journalism:<br><br>SECRET FEAR THAT DRIVES ME TO WIN; 10 IN A ROW<br><br>(Daily Record &ndash; November 19, 1998)<br><br>Exclusive James Traynor<br><br>Rangers  chairman David Murray opens up on the highs and lows of his decade in  charge of Rangers and promises that the best is still to come&hellip;&rdquo;<br><br>So  ran Mr Traynor&rsquo;s now infamously sycophantic article on how Sir David  Murray would conquer the world with Rangers, building to those fateful  lines:<br><br>&ldquo;He was about to take in another mouthful of the most  succulent lamb &ndash; anyone who knows Murray shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to learn  he is a full-blooded, unashamed red meat eater &ndash; when he put down his  knife and fork.<br><br>It was like a statement of intent and looking  directly across the table to make sure I hadn&rsquo;t yet succumbed to the  wine, he said:<br><br>&ldquo;Bring on the next 10 years, there&rsquo;s more to come for Rangers.&rdquo;<br><br>There  certainly was more to come from Rangers: sold for a quid, put into  administration, liquidated and lucky to be playing fourth-tier football.<br><br>And  that &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo;? Well it&rsquo;s so engrained as a concept in Glasgow&rsquo;s  media culture that these days it even has its own Wikipedia entry.<br><br>In  the light of this, Channel 4 News can now reveal exactly what  &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo; journalism means, from the hand of the RFC press  supremo James Traynor.<br><br>Let&rsquo;s go back just a short time to when  the current Ibrox director of communications was football writer at The  Daily Record and its sister paper the Sunday Mail.<br><br>Back in July  2011, there were searching questions to be asked of Rangers. Like just  who was Craig Whyte? What was his business record and just what was  really happening inside Ibrox?<br><br>But far from it.<br><br>In fact,  at times, so unquestioning of Mr Whyte was Mr Traynor that we know of at  least one occasion when he actually sent an article to Craig Whyte for  prior editorial approval before it went into the newspaper.<br><br>July  14th is the day the French celebrate the overthrow of deference. But not  in Glasgow where, on that day in 2011, James Traynor submitted an  article due for the Sunday Mail, to Craig Whyte, with the following  message:<br><br>14 July 2011 14:49<br><br>(Hi Craig, as agreed the  following is what I think would cover the Sunday Mail piece. You&rsquo;ll  notice I start with the &pound;15m but also that I haven&rsquo;t quoted you on that  amount. There might be one or two minor alterations between now and the  deadline but these would only be cosmetic and grammatical once I&rsquo;ve had a  final look.Thanks, JT.)<br><br>He then submits his Sunday Mail article  to Craig Whyte in full, for Mr Whyte&rsquo;s approval, quoting the Rangers  boss on grand plans in the transfer market and writing about the &pound;15m to  be spent buying the best.<br><br>Much of the article in fact is simply a  string of quotes from Mr Whyte on his vision for Rangers after just a  few weeks in the job.<br><br>The next day, Craig Whyte replies to Mr Traynor saying he&rsquo;s satisfied the article can go in the paper, subject to a change:<br><br>Date: 15 July 2011 10:47<br>Subject: Re: Sunday piece.<br>To: jxxxxxx@xxxxxX<br>Hi Jim,<br><br>Only one thing &ndash; I&rsquo;d rather not be quoted being critical of a particular player, ie. Danns. Other than that it&rsquo;s fine.<br><br>Best,<br><br>Craig<br><br>Just  four minutes later Jim Traynor is emailing Craig Whyte straight back to  assure him the offending quote will not appear in the Sunday Mail:<br><br>From:<br>Date: 15 July 2011 10:51<br>Subject: Sunday piece.<br>To: cxxxxxx@xxxxxxx<br><br>No problem Craig. It&rsquo;s out. Thanks. JT.<br><br>And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what&rsquo;s known as the &ldquo;succulent lamb&rdquo; in the world of Glasgow journalism.<br><br>In goes the article to the Sunday Mail, all about Mr Whyte&rsquo;s &pound;15m transfer treasure chest and all the rest of it.<br><br>Crucially,  the glowing piece came after several months of doubt about Mr Whyte&rsquo;s  financial clout and willingness to invest his own money into the club.<br><br>The big spending promised in the article, approved by Mr Whyte, never did materialise.<br><br>One  small episode in a greater scheme of things where &ndash; across all sections  of the mainstream media &ndash; too few searching questions were asked about  Sir David Murray and then Craig Whyte &ndash; successive owners who ultimately  brought the club to its knees.<br><br>But there&rsquo;s more.<br><br>Far from probing the probity of Craig Whyte, James Traynor was actually going on to probe him for a job at Rangers.<br><br>And here, for the first time, is your proof.<br><br>It comes in a series of text messages exchanged between James Traynor and Craig Whyte just a few months later in January 2012.<br><br>By  now of course, the mounting problems at Rangers would have been more  apparent and fans needed to know the full scale. But Mr Traynor had  other things on his mind &ndash; a job under Craig Whyte. Here&rsquo;s the text  exchange:<br><br>6 JAN 2012 11.43<br>Hi Craig, haven&rsquo;t been sacked,  haven&rsquo;t resigned despite all the rumours. However, I&rsquo;m almost certain I  can get out within weeks if I insist. Do you want to talk? JT<br><br>6 JAN 2012 16.07<br><br>Hi Jim, I&rsquo;m back in Glasgow next Friday. Let&rsquo;s meet up then and discuss. C.<br><br>6 JAN 2012 16.32<br><br>Okay, see you then.<br><br>Of  course, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong in looking for a new job &ndash; we all do it  all the time. And of course we don&rsquo;t know the preamble to these texts,  but the curio here is merely the context that an experienced journalist  should apparently be seeking a job from Mr Whyte, should want to be part  of his Rangers operation. Channel 4 News understands they did indeed  meet and discuss a job at the club. One month after that text exchange &ndash;  one year ago this week -  Rangers filed legal papers at the Court of  Sessions to appoint administrators.<br><br>Did James Traynor simply not know things were amiss?<br><br>Craig  Whyte was banned by the Scottish football authorities from the game for  bringing it into disrepute after Rangers ended up liquidated. They  fined him &pound;200,000.<br><br>So there you have it. What so many fans long  suspected is laid bare. James Traynor has since made it to Rangers under  the new Charles Green regime on a reported six figure salary.<br><br>Today  Mr Traynor, through channels at Ibrox, issued this statement to Channel  4 News: &ldquo;These suggestions are malicious and misleading. Anyone who  knows anything about events at Rangers knows that James Traynor, in his  capacity as a journalist, was instrumental in exposing the activities of  the Craig Whyte regime which are currently subject to criminal  investigation.&rdquo;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br><br></div></div>
