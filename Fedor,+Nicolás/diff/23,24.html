The name &#39;Miku&#39; is a nickname derived from the Hungarian equivalent of his first name &#39;Miklos&#39;. <br><br></i>Miku is a player who has spent much of his career on loan out to clubs. His record is not exactly stellar but he is an international and at his last club Getafe he had what seemed to be a commendable record of a goal in every four games (he was at a mid table team) and he even scored once against Real Madrid. <br><br>Despite being their top goal scorer in the past season and their prime striker, he was again shipped out on loan and this time to Celtic. Curious for any side to loan out their top scorer but were Celtic to find an undervalued gem or not? The answer was sadly to be the latter.<br><br>Arriving as one of three notable foreign signings at the end of the summer 2012 transfer window, due to his exotic background (i.e. Latin American raised, Eastern European father and Spanish football trained) he seemed to stand out. The Spanish league was in a golden period and with European football a priority for Celtic, as the club was back in the Champions League, Miku was expected to add value to the squad.<br><br>Despite being given ample opportunities, Miku struggled. His work-rate was good, his movement impressive and his skill obvious. Yet, for all that ability his total return was poor! In the SPL, a far weaker league than he had been reared in, his record was simply pathetic. Some quipped that his body language showed he was getting demotivated or losing self-confidence. If he wanted to stay he had to pick up fast and importantly take advantage of what was in front of him. If he couldn&rsquo;t get motivated enough after playing for Celtic in the Champions League in incredible atmospheres, then there is little anyone else can do. <br><br>The high point for him was his place in the 2-1 win over Barcelona in the Champions League. Not necessarily pivotal in the match, but he put in a great shift in a difficult victory, and looked very comfortable holding up the ball in the opposition half. For that the support commend him but then again he wasn&#39;t being pressured to make or score goals, just keep the ball up the field.<br><br>However, in the run of the mill domestic games he was getting nowhere and his value was marginal. As a loan signing he had to realise he had to hit the ground running hard, and as he&rsquo;d been repeatedly on loans in his career, he knew this clearly. Supporters saw glimpses of his talent and thought each time the support should wait and give him another chance, but there&#39;s just so many chances the management can give before they have to stop.<br><br>In fairness, he admitted difficulty in settling into Scotland, granted taking in the culture difference to what he has been used to, but then stated that the support was now seeing the best of him. The embarrassing nil-nil draw with Arbroath in the Scottish Cup showed little of that. He was making the runs in games and maybe the first team weren&#39;t playing to his strengths but he had joined Celtic and not the other way round, so he should have to adapt. Some would argue that his attitude seemed to be wrong and seemed to go in a huff if after his runs that the ball didn&#39;t come to him; a bit overstated but some truth to this.<br><br>Lassad, who came in at the same time, ended up showing him up in the early matches to the surprise of many (although he himself later seemed to be no better). The writing was on the wall, with rumours of talks already in early December to terminate Miku&#39;s loan in January rather than wait to the summer. However, he stayed or Celtic couldn&#39;t shift him (as club tied), and he remained on the books but was noticeably less on the bench let alone the first team. <br><br>He was given token appearances after the January transfer window, and he did apply himself well despite limited game time, a mark of a good professional. Celebrated the title win deservedly as much as anyone on the big day.<br><br>Miku&#39;s move simply wasn&#39;t working out as we expected despite glimpses of his ability. Lesser gifted players were providing more, and it&#39;s an important note about any player that talent alone goes only so far. He was all show with little end-product. Celtic were another notch on his growing line of loan moves, so the problem wasn&#39;t likely Celtic as he was not settling for long anywhere in a first team. Celtic were his sixth team on loan in his short career. Like others, the Celtic staff could see his talent but again a puzzle why he couldn&#39;t sustain success anywhere (although in fairness he did well at one or two lower tier sides in his career). <br><br>Having played and performed well in the great victory over Barcelona, he will definitely be remembered a touch more favourably than other loan players Celtic have had on our books over the years. He won&#39;t be marked down to the same extent as for example Brozek has been. However, it was sadly no great success story at Celtic. <i><br><span class="diffRemove">  </span><span class="diffRemove">  </span><br></i><b><span class="diffAdd">Post-Celtic</span></b><br><span

Is this the  &quot;modus operandi&quot; that man discovers the child and exploring their  environment to learn. However, at 27, Nicholas&#39; Miku &quot;Fedor is such that  the lessons never stop coming through this simple system, a formula  that now allows you to wait with patience and understanding as it passes  through Scotland left behind ... only as &quot;a sad memory.&quot;<br><br>Within  two months, the Venezuelan forward will be on a plane and change the  page and continue his career. When you look out the window and see what  they left behind, not a nostalgic feel. By then, stay at Celtic FC  Glasgow City alone will have been a bitter pill for a year that he  admits &quot;want to remove from your head.&quot;<br><br>Honestly, the  Caracas-born striker admits being wrong on the last decision he made to  his professional side. &quot;It was a mistake to go there (Scotland). Simply  because I can not do anything,&quot; Fedor loose, knowing that even should  remain at the club on loan until end of season Betis. And in August 2012  &#39;Miku&#39; went from being a starter in the Getafe immovable, to be  relegated to the bench at Celtic.<br><br>&quot;At first I did not understand.  I said to myself: &#39;How might come to play in the best league in the  world (Spain) and no part of Scotland?&#39; (...) But then I realized that  things had nothing to do with sports, &quot;says another former Valencia  striker, who was coming off his best season in Getafe (12 goals) and  thought just leave Scotland in December, but FIFA rules were filed.<br><br>The  romance between &#39;Miku&#39; and Celtic started well.

I like to face  the truth. They do not like me say one thing and then do another front  behind. &quot;<br><br>Despite the stabbing had to handle frustration, Nicol&aacute;s  Fedor found tranquility to fully understand your situation. &quot;I know you  are going to play those who are there, who knows coach and they have  more confidence. If there is an injury, I know I can participate,&quot; he  says, and then discuss their current status reminds one of past  experiences: &quot;I liken it a lot with what I experienced in Valencia.  Obviously there playing David Villa and not me, a compelling reason.  addition I was very young and impetuous, so that I could not absorb it.&quot;<br><br>Knowing  that has its days numbered in Scottish Highlands, the Caracas agree  that he would have liked to have continuity in at least five straight.  &quot;The last time I was the owner, after I returned from the concentration  of burgundy in Madrid, got goal. Then spent six league matches without  playing. So what I have to do?;?

I feel very loved and well respected  in the selection,&quot; he says. In turn clings to the family, while waiting  to pass the days.<br><br>Already, deck options for the immediate  future. Back to Spain, where he lived the last 12 years, is the  strongest alternative, plus you still have a contract with Getafe.  &quot;There have been some very good things in the Spanish league. Teams are  interested in positions with good European and other places in the  table.&#39;s Goal is to return to the world elite&quot; confirms, preferring not  to forward names before there is a agreement.<br><br>That is why the Venezuelan hungarian descent thank God, because even in December to seven clubs in Spain called it.<br><br>His  stay in Scotland is not o
