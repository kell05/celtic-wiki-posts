He can possibly be ranked amongst the greatest ever strikers from these isles in goal returns at least. <br><br>He had played trials at Parkhead in 1905 but did not join the Hoops until some two years later when it was hoped he would become the natural successor to the legendary Jimmy Quinn. <i><br></i><blockquote><i>&quot;I must say Celtic was the team who game me the chance to come into football and I was lucky. I came to a good club. They treated me very well.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>Davie McLean certainly had no difficulty in finding his scoring boots. On his competitive debut - a league clash at home to Port Glasgow Athletic on 2nd November 1907 - he hammered in a hat-trick as Celtic triumphed 5-0. <br><br>As a player, Davie McLean boasted lightening quick reactions and a powerful shot. Often he would latch on to a loose ball and drive it into the net before the opposition had even sensed the danger. He was able to score from any angle and his pace was a constant thorn in the side of defenders.<br><br>He was however as quick with his tongue as he was his feet. He was not one to accept criticism willingly and as a result he would soon find conflict with Willie Maley. On 12th September 1908, Celtic drew 4-4 with Queen&#39;s Park in the Glasgow Cup, there were issues following the final whistle:<blockquote><div><i>&quot;Willie  Maley came in and pitched into us us in a black rage. There were seven  internationalists and they sat there dumb, and took it. I decided there  and then no one was going to talk to me like that and get away with  it&quot;.</i></div></blockquote><br>As manager Willie Maley was not one to tolerate players who challenged his authority, although he did make some exceptions, but Davie McLean was not to be one of those exceptions. So, his personality clash with Willie Maley meant that in November 1909 he was sold to Preston North End for &pound;400. <br><br>When Celtic years later hunted for a successor to Jimmy Quinn, Willie Maley on  being questioned for letting Davie McLean go, he replied that the boy had not  possessed the Celtic spirit. Davie McLean was young when at Celtic, leaving aged at only around 19, so Willie Maley&#39;s comment appears a bit churlish.<br><br>Another reason for his departure could be possibly in part religious (but not in a sectarian way). As a Protestant at the club he was obviously well aware (and likely respectful) of the cultural history embedded in the club. He openly complained though of the constant harassment by priests &amp; nuns for charitable contributions. It didn&#39;t bother some other Protestants at the club, but it&#39;s an interesting complaint by the man. He can count himself lucky he didn&#39;t go to a Catholic school then, where charity collections were a regular norm. <br><br>He had scored 19 goals for Celtic in 28 league appearances, which for any young aspiring player is quite an achievement.  He was clearly a precocious talent.<br><br>Ridiculously, due to the then prevailing rules Davie McLean didn&#39;t  receive a medal  for his part in  the league championships that Celtic won. He  hadn&#39;t played in the Scottish Cup with Celtic and therefore also missed out  on any deserved medals in this competition.<br><br>His departure disappointed the Celtic support and that disappointment grew as David McLean continued his scoring feats in England. With his career record Celtic fans were left to wonder what might have been, but then again Celtic had the mighty Jimmy Quinn, and there was nobody who could displace him in the side. This As he was to say himself:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;I was understudy to one of the best centre-forwards who ever played, Jimmy Quinn.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br><span class="diffRemove">However, after</span><span class="diffAdd">After</span> his departure in the following few seasons, Celtic didn&#39;t win the league, so there is an argument that his loss cost <span class="diffRemove">Celtic, but</span><span class="diffAdd">Celtic.</span> <span class="diffRemove">with</span><span class="diffAdd">However,</span> Celtic turned things round to dominate the league in the following decade, aided by the great goalscoring form of players like Jimmy McColl who ended up playing &amp; then succeeding Jimmy Quinn in a way that David McLean likely could have if he had remained at Celtic.<br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="McLean, David - Pic" height="346" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/GsrpHTuoYZdbliuC0gFA8Q973935/GW238H346" title="McLean, David - Pic" width="238"></h3>After Celtic, Davie continued to make a name for himself including spells at Sheffield Wednesday, Forfar, Third Lanark and Dundee.  By the time he moved to Sheffield Wednesday in February 1911 he was rated amongst the best forwards in the game. <br><br>His records across his clubs were exceptional, including 25 goals in 49 league games for Preston North End, 88 goals in 132 league games for Sheffield Wednesday and 49 goals in 85 games for Bradford Park Avenue. He is possibly one of the most consistent goalscorers ever across a number of clubs ever in the UK.<br><br>In England, he top scored twice in successive seasons in England&#39;s top  flight when playing for the Wednesday as the Sheffield club were then  named. The first two of those occasions he shared the distinction before  he was outright winner in 1913/14. <br><br>His most noted spell (excluding Celtic) was a one season tenure at Rangers (1918/19) where he scored an incredible 29 goals in just 24  matches as Rangers finished second in the  League, just one point behind  Celtic. Davie McLean was the top scorer in the  Scottish League that season, and the Celtic support should count their blessings that he didn&#39;t carry on there. <br><br>Thankfully he didn&#39;t score for Rangers in either of his two games v Celtic: a 2-0 Glasgow Cup final defeat and a 1-1 New Years Day Derby draw in the league. Celtic won the league by just the 1pt above Rangers, and his contribution could have swayed the title either way. He&#39;d scored 8 goals in three league matches just prior to the pivotal New Years derby game, so likely a surprise that he didn&#39;t perform v Celtic. He didn&#39;t score in any of five league games in January 1919 for Rangers, and you could argue his underperformance in this month likely cost Rangers the title. Celtic fans will have been thankful at least.<br><br>As a measure of recognition of his quality, he won a cap for Scotland, playing  against the Auld Enemy England in a 1-1 draw  at Hampden in March 1912 in front of over  127,000 spectators, which was the least he ever deserved. Sadly, it was a solitary cap.<br><br>Davie McLean had joined Dundee in 1922 where helped in Dundee&#39;s run to the 1924-25 Scottish Cup Final. In the final Davie McLean&#39;s goal had Dundee leading at half time. Celtic&#39;s Patsy Gallacher equalised before Jimmy McGrory headed a last minute Celtic winner. He just kept missing out on winning major silverware away from Celtic.<br><br>In an interesting career, it is estimated that he scored around 500 goals in total, which is a phenomenal total for any striker in any era. He played to an old age, having moved to Forfar to play for five seasons. His last match for Forfar was  on 5th September 1931, just three months away from  his 41st birthday,  in a Division Two match away to Arbroath which  Forfar lost 2-0. The &#39;<i>Alphabet of the Celts&#39;</i> book claims he signed up with Dykehead in 1932, where he appears to have hung up his boots. Later became a scout for Huddersfield Town. <br><br><div>Davie McLean also played <a href="/page/Cricket" target="_self">cricket</a> for Strathmore C.C. and famously played in a match in June 1930 at The Hill in Kirriemuir when J.M. Barrie (author of &#39;<i>Peter Pan</i>&#39;) opened  the pavilion, and two members of the touring Australian side, one of  them the great Charlie Macartney, played before a packed crowd. </div><br>Apart from when  his footballing career took him elsewhere, he lived in Forfar all his  life. He never lost a love for the game, and was frequently attending football matches and often invited to be a guest of Celtic at games in which Celtic were involved. A wonderful touch so despite the premature departure from Celtic, there was still a good relationship with the club.<br><br>Davie McLean passed away in Forfar on 23rd December 1967. <br><br>An interesting player to read up on in Scottish footballing history. Possibly the greatest Scottish goalscorer that is least known by the general Scottish football support.
