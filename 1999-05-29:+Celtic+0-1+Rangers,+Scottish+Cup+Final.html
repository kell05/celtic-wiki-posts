This Scottish Cup final at Hampden Park was never an  exhilarating aria in terms of its football, but Dick Advocaat, the  Rangers coach, can certainly sing in his bath of his accomplishments  this term. <br>Rod Wallace, supposedly tracked by Enrico Annoni in a  plan hatched by Jozef Venglos, sprang Rangers a goal after 48 minutes  which Celtic were doomed never to equal. The Ibrox club weathered stern  tests in patches of both halves but, save for some skirmishes around  Stefan Klos which the German handled stoically, the winners never quite  came under sustained siege by Celtic. In the 80th minute, indeed,  Jonathan Gould pounced adroitly to his left to block a Gabriel Amato  shot that would have made these closing 10 minutes irrelevant. <br>The  match was a triumph for Rangers, certainly in the sense of Advocaat&#39;s  gritty resilience which transmits to his players, in his valued use of  such players as Tony Vidmar, who yesterday played astutely, and in the  way his team bounds forward through players such as Wallace, Jorg  Albertz and Neil McCann. Long have been the waxing portraits produced of  Celtic&#39;s historically gallivanting style but this Rangers side of the  Dutchman&#39;s deserves every bit as much credit. Only the sixth treble in  the Ibrox club&#39;s history has come around through an attitude focused to  attack, a policy Advocaat clearly relishes continuing, in announcing  last night a two-year extension to his current contract. <br>In one  solitary second in this game there was a moment of Celtic outcry, of  injustice felt in the bloodstream, but it was flawed and quite mistaken.  <br>In one of their impassioned bursts of assault, Paul Lambert&#39;s shot  cannoned against Lorenzo Amoruso, and the Celtic players mobbed Hugh  Dallas, the referee, beseeching the penalty. Dallas, with some  composure, withstood that unsightly buffeting, and television showed the  ball clearly played the Italian&#39;s chest. <br>Hence, this match was one  more bitter chapter for the Celtic faithful to absorb, and the debate  will now go on about the esteemed role of Jozef Venglos. Yesterday,  Venglos omitted Mark Burchill completely, twinning Lubomir Moravcik with  Henrik Larsson in attack, and playing Annoni in an unusual role,  decisions that will inevitably come under attack. The Slovakian, it must  be said, looked pallid and tired at the end of this, a sign that this  essentially cultivated man isn&#39;t one for the rancid headlines he assumed  would follow. <br>The squall forever blowing up at the omission of  Burchill is certainly odd, given that, firstly, more than a few astute,  though less voluble observers, reserve doubts about his talents, and  secondly, his replacement on the Celtic bench, Tommy Johnson, had scored  three goals in three matches. If the fact remains that Venglos is  probably more a football analyst than an enforcer, Celtic&#39;s main hurt  yesterday remained not tactics, but their loss of four players. There  was also a lame performance from Larsson, a player whose feats this  season have clearly left him jaded. <br>It might be doubted if Mark  Viduka, one of those missing for Celtic, would have made any impression  here. Such games are rarely lauded for their stalwart defensive duties,  but in this match, a crop of rearguard figures deserved the laurels  traditionally given to strikers. For Celtic, Johan Mjallby made  thrusting, incisive tackles, despite being prohibitively booked as early  as the 16th minute, and between Mjallby and Alan Stubbs, the buffeting  style of Amato was manfully cordoned. Amato&#39;s habit is to howl to the  referee for himself being the victim of much hacking, but in this game,  he was lucky not to be booked for a blatant dive after Tom Boyd had  failed to touch him. <br>In these eulogies to defenders, nor can this  match be allowed to pass without noting the bellowing hymn wafting off  the Rangers support in repeated homage to Lorenzo Amoruso. It wasn&#39;t one  full winter ago, of course, since this memorably conceited Italian was  being harangued at Ibrox for a style that mixed posing and dozing in  equal measure. When the Rangers support, in fine unison yesterday, sang  of there being &quot;only one Amoruso&quot;, you almost quaked at the dramatic  sea-change in this man&#39;s fortunes. One of the final sights of this  occasion yesterday was this mad celebratory dance which Amoruso  practices, a movement which must worry psychiatrists. <br>In the face of  the excellence of both Stubbs and Mjallby, though, Celtic were pierced  after 48 minutes. In his fluid formation, Venglos had tried Annoni in a  man-marking role on Wallace, a tactic that ended with the Italian  trudging off after 61 minutes. Thirteen minutes earlier, strategy had  nothing to do with Wallace&#39;s strike: Vidmar&#39;s cross met the boot of  McCann, whose shot was blocked, and when the ball broke to Wallace, he  belted it past Gould. Whatever the cruel fates they felt were strewn  across this match, Celtic could do no more than tear at Rangers in the  second period. From Boyd&#39;s cross, Larsson couldn&#39;t have known the time  and space he had for his header, and the chance was lost. From a  double-salvo from Stubbs from 18 yards, Colin Hendry was waylaid by the  first, and Klos bravely stood his ground to fist the second. Johnson&#39;s  shot then looped tantalisingly wide of the post as Rangers weathered  whatever Celtic threw at them. <br>If this is big Stubbs&#39;s last match  for Celtic, his career in Scotland should not go neglected. Yesterday he  was full of spirit, brave, and hungrily assaulting this game, but  Celtic, ultimately, needed more cultured gifts yesterday.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Player Ratings:</h3>    <b>Jonathan Gould</b>  (7) - The big Englishman turned in another accomplished display between  the sticks and made some important stops towards the end of the first  half. Never put a foot wrong. His kick-outs from pass backs nearly  always found a Celtic man. <br><br><b>Tom Boyd</b> (8) - The skipper  didn&#39;t deserve to be on the losing side on Saturday afternoon. Boyd did  an excellent man-marking job on Neil McCann and was an inspiration.  Defended comfortably and put in some saving tackles<br><br><b>Alan Stubbs</b>  (7) - One of Celtic&#39;s better players, the big defender will be  disappointed to end his career on such a low note. Stubbs mopped up  almost everything at the back and came close to getting himself on the  scoresheet from set pieces a few times. A towering figure in the Celtic  defence. <br><br><b>Johan Mjallby</b> (6) - Had a fascinating duel with Amato, with honours just about even after the 90 minutes. <br>However,  he won&#39;t fancy watching too many replays of the incident when the  Argentine stitched him up with an outrageous piece of skill on the  touchline. He was booked as early as the 15th minute but was not put off  his game. Needed to get forward more.<br><br><b>Stephane Mahe</b> (6) -  A sinner the last time the teams met, the Frenchman was on his best  behaviour at Hampden. Didn&#39;t do much wrong and defended reasonably well  before being replaced by Phil O&#39;Donnell. Considering the amount of  pressure he was under performed reasonably well. Needed to get forward  more.<br><br><b>Morten Weighorst</b> (5) - Handed an unfamiliar slot on  the right-hand side of midfield, the role soon looked alien to the big  Dane, who contributed nothing in either defence or attack. Had to work  his socks off just to counter the runs from Vidmar, Albertz and Wallace.  <br><br><b>Enrico Annoni</b> (6) - The Italian was handed the task of  stifling Rod Wallace and did his job reasonably well though he seemed to  take time to adjust to the pace of the game and was left for dead a few  times by the man he was supposed to be marking. However, pace has  always been the former Roma defender&#39;s Achilles heel and it was cruelly  exposed a few times in the wide open spaces of Hampden. Replaced by  Tommy Johnson on the hour mark. <br><br><b>Paul Lambert</b> (7) -  Celtic&#39;s best player. Outplayed van Bronckhorst in the middle of the  park. Unlucky not to open the scoring at the new national stadium when  his 30-yard effort came crashing back off the crossbar in the first  half. Rarely wastes a pass and is one of the few Scots who could walk  into any English Premiership side. <br><br><b>Regi Blinker</b> (4) -  Unpredictable as ever and unable to get much change out of McInnes.  Lucky not to be red-carded for a two- footed lunge on McInnes, the  little Dutchman was a passenger for the entire match. The occasion  seemed too much for him and he was largely anonymous, poor first 45,  better in the second.<br><br><b>Lubomir Moravcik</b> (5) - Starting only  his second game after a four-month absence with a hamstring injury, the  Slovak didn&#39;t even look half fit. Playing in a free role behind  Larsson, he never really got into the game and was a major  disappointment. Well marked by McInnes. Looked more sharp as the game  continued. <br><br><b>Henrik Larsson</b> (6) - Scotland&#39;s Player of the  Year gave his all but just couldn&#39;t find a way past Hendry and Amoruso.  Had little support up front and the burden of carrying Celtic almost  single-handedly for much of the season finally took its toll. The fact  that Amoruso won the early exchanges between the two was an indicator of  what was to come. <br><br>SUBS &ndash; <br><b>Phil O&#39;Donnell</b> (3) -  Couldn&#39;t force his way into the match when he replaced Stephane Mahe,  O&#39;Donnell&#39;s Parkhead career ended on a low note before his summer move  to Sheffield Wednesday. <br><br><b>Tommy Johnson</b> (3) - Preferred  instead of young Mark Burchill, the striker was hardly noticed when he  came on for Annoni although he worked hard got little return from the  Rangers defence.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h3>Key Incidents:</h3>    <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="MsoTableGrid" height="537" width="987">  <tbody><tr>   <td width="74">   21 minutes   </td>   <td width="621">    Celtic   pile forward to the edge of the Rangers penalty area.

We tried to do our best and I think during the season the team tried to give everything<br>&quot;Today  I think we were not the worst team. We had our problems especially with  injuries. We had the problem with Vidar but the players who played felt  OK.<br>&quot;Football is sometimes like that.<br>&quot; I have no regrets about  not playing Mark in the final. If you saw how the game was running,  there were so many bodies in front of the penalty area it was not for  counter-attacking players or those who run at opponents. It was not his  game.<br>&quot;There were seven other players left out and I could not speak to all of them. <br>&quot;Maybe  if we had been allowed more substitutes he would have been on the  bench. Maybe the cup organisers should allow more players on the bench.<br>&quot;I  am never satisfied, but it was a difficult season. We have a very good  team with good players, but nobody can take seve or eight regular  players out of a team and hope to win. Next season we will be  successful.&quot;<br><br>&quot;When I came here I made an agreement and I am an  easy going coach. I am not too easy leaving and I know that we have  quality players and I know we will win.<br>&quot;There are two things for us  to consider before next season. We need to bring in new players, but  also I hope players like Burley, McNamara, Rieper and Johnson are fully  fit. That is very important.&quot;<br><br><i>Phil O&rsquo;Donnell</i>:<br>&quot;It was good just to be involved because I hadn&#39;t expected to be stripped. <br>&quot;I was resigned to the fact that our match at Dunfermline three weeks ago had been my last in a Celtic jersey. <br>&quot;I  felt for Sid at being left out but it wasn&#39;t just him. Tosh McKinlay,  Harald Brattbakk and Mark Burchill would have felt just as bad. <br>&quot;I  know just how bad that feels. When we won the Coca-Cola Cup last season I  missed the final through injury after playing in every round leading up  to it. <br>&quot;It was an emotional time for me but losing this game  overtook everything. When I finally went on all I was hoping for was to  get that goal we needed. <br>&quot;We had loads of possession in that last half-hour and put Rangers under pressure, but the equaliser just wouldn&#39;t come. <br>&quot;Ultimately we just couldn&#39;t get the wee break we needed. There were a few scrambles and their goalkeeper had a few good saves. <br>&quot;It wasn&#39;t a classic final. The play was a bit scrappy but that was almost to be expected. <br>&quot;Both  sets of players were under a lot of pressure after what had happened in  the previous game and that made it a tense affair. <br>&quot;It was the sort of match in which one goal was always likely to be enough. Unfortunately for us, it was Rangers who got it. <br>&quot;Paul  Lambert was unlucky when he hit the bar in the first half - a couple of  inches lower and that would have been a great goal. <br>&quot;Neither team played flowing football, though.&quot; <br><br><br><i>Dick Advocaat</i>:<br>&quot;It  was quite a close game with not many chances. Celtic had to take a few  risks in the last 15 minutes and had some opportunities to equalise, but  we should already have been 2-0 up. Over the 90 minutes, Rangers  deserved to win.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  <b>Celtic 0-1 Rangers <a class="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/355857.stm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">[BBC]</a><br><br></b></h3>   Rangers won the first Old Firm Scottish Cup final in 10 years, giving  them a sixth domestic treble and denying Celtic a single trophy in a  painful season for the Parkhead club.  <br>The Bhoys will consider  themselves unlucky, after creating a number of chances.  But striker  Henrik Larsson had a rare off day and the Rangers defence held firm with  Colin Hendry playing through the pain of a groin injury and Lorenzo  Amoruso winning the man of the match award.  <br>Equally importantly for  Scottish football, the game passed off without major incident or  controversy following the scenes the last time the two clubs met, 27  days earlier.  All eyes were on referee Hugh Dallas and the players  after the league game at Parkhead saw three dismissals, a missile thrown  at the official and public order problems around Glasgow.  Perhaps as a  result the match started in a subdued atmosphere and the first shot -  from Celtic - did not arrive until the 14th minute.   <br>A pattern of  the side in green and white enjoying more of the ball with Rangers  looking to break was set at this early stage.  On 16 minutes a Neil  McCann run was checked by Johan Mjallby, who was booked before  Jorg  Albertz wasted the free kick.<br>  <br><b>Tempers briefly flare </b><br>   Two minutes later promises of good behaviour were forgotten for a split  second as another unnecessary foul was committed by Lubomir Moravcik on  the edge of the area.  <br>Amoruso received a strict lecture from  referee Dallas as the heat increased within the rebuilt Hampden Park.   Rangers came closer with this free kick but not as close as Celtic&#39;s  Paul Lambert two minutes later,  He hit the woodwork from  almost 30  yards out before the Gers&#39; best chance of the half was wasted by  Wallace.  The striker&#39;s control let him down after he had run clear and  Jon Gould pounced to deny the former Leeds player.  <br><b>Rangers take lead</b><br>  <br>The  second half started with Rangers by far the sharper, and within four  minutes of the restart Wallace had given them the lead.  A ball was  played into the Celtic box, which McCann managed to turn behind  Wallace&#39;s man-marker Annoni.  The Englishman was six yards out with  Gould to beat, and he made no mistake to score his 27th of a productive  first season in Scotland.  <br>Jo Venglos&#39;s side looked like they needed  a change, and the Celtic coach turned to another former Aston Villa man  in a bid to provide Henrik Larsen with more support up front.  Tommy  Johnson, whose time ijn Glasgow has been badly disrupted by injuries,  came on for Annoni.  He did not make an immediate impact although by the  hour mark Celtic were looking more likely to score, with Rangers still  happy to soak up pressure.  <br><b>Half chances</b><br>  Morten  Wieghorst, Stephane Mahe and Alan Stubbs all had half chances saved by  Klos.  Johnson also saw an effort deflected just wide with 17 minutes of  normal time remaining.  <br>The pressure was starting to build with  Rangers unable to get the ball out of their half, particularly after  McCann went off injured.  Andrei Kanchelskis came on after 77 minutes,  presumably to help Rangers keep the ball when they broke.  And they had a  chance to finish it when Albertz ran down the left after 81 minutes,  but Gabriel Amato&#39;s effort was saved superbly by Gould.  With three  minutes to go a number of shots from the edge of the Rangers area were  charged down and Amoruso eventually deflected Lambert&#39;s long range  effort wide.  Celtic&#39;s fans at the same end of stadium howled for a  penalty but replays showed the ball came off the Italian&#39;s chest for a  corner.  Referee Dallas had got a crucial decision right, and it turned  out to be Celtic&#39;s final real chance of a dispiriting afternoon, despite  almost five minutes of injury time.<br><br><br>  <br><font size="2"><b> Rangers:</b>  Klos, Porrini, Hendry, Amoruso, Vidmar, McCann, McInnes, Van  Bronckhorst, Wallace, Amato, Albertz.
