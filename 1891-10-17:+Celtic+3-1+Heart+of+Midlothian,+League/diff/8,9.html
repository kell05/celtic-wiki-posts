In the earlier part of the season the teams met at Tynecastle, with the result that the Scottish Cup holders won by three goals to one. Since then the Celtic have carried everything before them, and it is well known that they were anxious for the return bout with their former conquerors. In regard to the importance of the match, the North British Railway ran a special from the Waverley to Parkhead, which was taken advantage of by some eight hundred of the followers of the Edinburgh club. Many of the supporters of Eastern football also made the journey west; these including Mr Lewis McIver, the Unionist candidate for the Parliamentary representation of the Southern Division of Edinburgh; and Messrs Sneddon and Bingham, president and vice-president of the East of Scotland Association. The Celtic followers also mustered in strong force and when the game commenced in pleasant weather at 3.45 there could not have been less than sixteen thousand present &ndash; a record League gate for Glasgow. From the start almost the Celtic had the best of matters, and their victory of three goals to one was thoroughly deserved on the day&rsquo;s play. The following will show the run of the game. Begbie won the toss, and compelled his opponents to kick off against the sun, this being the only advantage. The Hearts were early dangerous, but Doyle was in the way and pulled them up with one of his mammoth kicks. Taylor then ran the ball to the Celtic goal, but unfortunately none of his companions were up, and an opportunity was lost. The Celts began to press, and Campbell sent in a fine shot, after a grand effort by Doyle, which Fairbairn threw aside. McMahon, however, was lying handy, and with a neat header he gained the first point of the match to the great satisfaction of the Celtic portion of the crowd. The Hearts played up with desperation, but their efforts, though well intended, were very rash. The Celts still continued to press hard, but after twenty minutes had elapsed the Cup-holders broke away in fine style. Taylor got a capital chance of registering a goal, but the efforts of the right winger simply sent the ball wildly over the bar. Another break away by the visitors gave Baird a chance, but he was so much off-side that the referee&rsquo;s whistle brought him back. The Celts once more assumed the aggressive, and McCallum succeeded in getting the ball through. A previous infringement nullified this effort of the ex-Notts Forest man. So far, it must be said the form of the Hearts had been very disappointing, Waterston perhaps being the only man who had exhibited his true form. The forwards seemed completely at sea, and they were easily held in check by the opposing backs, of whom Doyle was very prominent. At last they raised the hopes of their supporters by showing glimpses of their true form, and after one or two plucky efforts Baird sent in a magnificent shot, which missed by a few inches. Keeping at it the Tynecastle men peppered their opponents&rsquo; goal to some tune. Just when they appeared certain to score, a foul by Russell pulled them up. Nearing half-time they again made desperate efforts to score, but Doyle appeared to be constantly in the way, and he alone frustrated all their attempts. At half-time the Celtic led by one goal to nothing. The Hearts started the second half in gallant style, and the opposing defence was soon tested. Scott has a great opening, but he missed the chance. The Celts then came away in a body, and McMahon sent in a hot shot to Fairbairn. The last-named negotiated the ball beautifully, but in so doing he left his charge. This presented an opportunity to Madden, who practically walked through the goal with the ball at his foot. This further success of the Celts was hailed with every manifestation of delight by their enthusiastic followers. The game continued to be played with undiminished vigour, the followers of the Celts being quite beside themselves with the excitement consequent on the grand form displayed by their team. Over and over again the visiting defence was put to its utmost trail, but Fairbairn continued to keep out several likely efforts. The Celts were not to be denied, however, and McMahon had the satisfaction of scoring the third goal, the ball going in off Adams. As this point seemed to put the issue out of doubt, there was extraordinary enthusiasm amongst the crowd. Fairbairn was impartially cheered for the clever manner in which he saved his goal just after. A foul relieved the pressure somewhat, but the Celts were still asserting themselves, even though the game had slowed down somewhat. In saving a shot from Madden, Fairbairn gave a corner, but it came to nothing. Just as the game seemed as good as over the Edinburgh players wakened up and Taylor scored a goal, which fairly took his opponents by surprise. This raised the drooping spirits of the Edinburgh crowd somewhat; but the team hardly rose to the occasion. Towards the finish the Celts took the game in their own hands and numerous shots were sent at Fairbairn. He repelled them with wonderful accuracy, and the crowd, to their credit be it said, were not slow to recognise his abilities. The last ten minutes was all in favour of the Celts, who plied Fairbairn with numerous shots. None took effect, however, and amid much excitement the game terminated as stated above.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Article<br></h3><h3>Match Report 2</h3><br>From a Newspaper Report at the time<br><br>At Parkhead on Saturday the return fixture between the Celtic and the Heart of Midlothian attracted about 15,000 spectators. The Hearts brought their full team, but the Celts were without Duff, their goalkeeper, whose place was taken by Kelly, of the reserves.<br>The Hearts won the toss, causing the Celts to play with the sunshine in their faces. Madden got the ball in motion, and immediately Campbell and McMahon began to work together, but were repulsed by Begbie. The Hearts worked their way down the field, but Doyle, with a huge kick, relieved the pressure. But the Edinburgh men returned to the attack, and Reynolds had to kick out a capital from the foot of Fairbairn jnr. Immediately after this the Celts came away with a rush and shot for goal, but Fairbairn had abundance of time to clear his charge.<br>Runs and counter runs followed, the players being too excited to settle down to good combined play. Kelly was putting in a great amount of good, useful play.<br>After ten minutes&rsquo; play the Celts scored amidst intense excitement. Campbell tried a long shot; the ball struck the crossbar, and McMahon coming in headed the ball through.<br>Doyle was playing grandly at full back, and for a time the Celts were fairly in it. McCallum sent in a terrible shot right into Fairbairn&rsquo;s hands, and of course the goal was saved. The great left-wing of the Celts, Campbell and McMahon, were being watched, but they succeeded in putting in some telling work, Campbell nearly scoring.<br>The Hearts gradually worked their way down, and Reynolds being outwitted, the ball was sent across to the right, and Taylor had an open goal at his mercy, but to the consternation of the Edinburgh people he shot high over the crossbar. <br>As the game progressed there was some beautiful passing by the Celtic forwards, who seemed to understand each other&rsquo;s play to perfection.<br>By some really clever tactics Baird and Scott got dangerously near the Celtic goal, but Baird shot past the post.<br>On the ball being again set in motion, the Celts worked their way into their opponents&rsquo; territory, when Campbell sent the ball through, but the whistle had previously been blown for offside, and the goal was disallowed. Then McMahon shot over the crossbar, and keeping up the pressure a corner was conceded, but it came to nothing. The Hearts were being pretty well hemmed in, but the Celtic shooting was erratic, Campbell and McMahon missing chances.<br>A foul against the Celtic gave the Hearts some advantage, which they failed to make use of, and again the Celts were pressing, but the ball was sent past. A foul against the Hearts close to their goal looked dangerous. Doyle took the kick and gave the ball to Campbell, but Dowds ultimately shot past.<br>The Hearts were seldom aggressive, but their backs were playing a dour game, and went in for bustling the Celtic forwards. Some good work on the part of Baird and Scott almost resulted in the downfall of the Celts&rsquo; goal, Kelly having to be exceedingly active in getting the ball away. Taylor on the extreme right, and Scott and Baird, were the most active of the forwards, and gave Reynolds any amount of work, his heading coming very opportune at times.<br>The Hearts were improving in their play, but were very unfortunate in front of goal. They ran the ball down well enough, but somehow there was nobody up in time to give the parting shot.<br>Of course, the defence was grand, Doyle being in very fine form, and seldom making a mistake either in kicking or in judgement.<br>At Half-Time the Celts were leading by one goal to nil.<br>The Hearts had the sun in their faces in the second half. They set to work at once, but Baird shot past the post. The Hearts returned to the attack with some good passing, but when near goal Begbie shot wide by yards.<br>In less than five minutes from the start Madden scored the second goal with an easy shot . Fairbairn repulsed a hot shot, but did not send the ball far enough away, and Madden, who happened to be on the spot at the time, had no difficulty in sending the ball through.<br>The Hearts were not in the least dismayed, and came away with some really pretty passing, forcing a corner, which came to nothing. Kelly was loudly cheered for one of those neat bits of tackling and dribbling so characteristic of his play. Russell had a fine chance to score for his side, but shot inaccurately.<br>The Celts were playing a deliberate pass game, and their play was value for more goals. They fairly besieged the Hearts&rsquo; goal time after time amidst the wildest excitement, but were unlucky, the ball going everywhere but through. It must be admitted that Fairbairn proved himself a thoroughly capable goalkeeper, for few men could have withstood the repeated attacks as he did. <br>But at length he was beaten, and fairly beaten, by McMahon, who scored the third goal for the Celts with a low shot, amidst tremendous cheering. A few minutes later Doyle almost scored with a long shot. The Celts were fairly playing with the Hearts, who resorted to four half-backs to strengthen their defence. The wonder is the Celts had not a few more goals.<br>At length the Hearts scored unexpectedly with a good cross-shot by Taylor. <br>The Celts continued to have all the best of the game. McMahon struck the post with a hard shot, and everyone thought the ball had gone through afterwards. The Celts were playing a winning game all over, simply running round the Hearts, but could not increase their score.<br>A rather one-sided game ended as follows &ndash; Celtic, 3 goals; Hearts, 1 goal.</div><br></div>
