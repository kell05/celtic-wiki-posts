It was a  different era, and as reflected across various fields (in particular in  the media at the BBC with Jimmy Saville and other celebrities), there  have been many other abuse scandals on a far wider scale. <br><br>It is  always easy to say in retrospect what should have been done, we must  learn from the errors made in the past so they are not repeated, and  that goes for all clubs and organisations.<br><br>It is hard to judge a past  era by the <span class="diffRemove">ethics</span><span class="diffAdd">ethics,</span> <span class="diffAdd">practices </span>&amp; <span class="diffRemove">practices</span><span class="diffAdd">controls</span> of another (such as now), but this is an area that has been poorly  managed by many clubs including our own. Celtic has a good well-earned reputation for  charity and its humane culture, but these events highlight that there were  failings made with major consequences, therefore greater vigilance must always  be made, especially with youth. <br><br>The Celtic Boys Club where the events occurred actually was a separate entity run fully independently to Celtic, however there have been close relations between the staff, similar as has been the case with other boys clubs across Scotland with Celtic.<br><br>Everyone is innocent until guilt  is proven, and that should be the case with all people even in these  cases, but it should also be investigated in order that justice  prevails. It is hard or wrong to pinpoint on any management alone, and  some people have had their careers tarnished by the allegations. That  though is no excuse, and as said, we must ensure this is not repeated in  any form.<br><br>The club has since the 1990s had in place stronger  controls in related organisations to work to ensure that there is no repeat of these events, but vigilance,  tolerance and understanding from all of us is also needed especially to  the children.<br><br></font></font><div><font face="Helvetica"><font face="Helvetica">To all those affected, our deepest sympathies and  we owe all our genuine respect for their privacy and a helping hand  where it is needed.</font></font></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Quotes<br></h3></div><div><font face="Helvetica"><font face="Helvetica">&quot;I will say this again.

He returned to the Boy&#39;s Club around 1980 and stayed until a series of Daily Record stories revealed abuse claims against him in 1996. <br> <br> He was jailed for two years in 1998 on conviction of abusing three former Celtic Boys&#39; Club players, including former Scotland international Alan Brazil, between 1967-74. <br> <br> At the trial, former Celtic photographer and Boys&#39; Club chairman Hugh Birt claimed Torbett was fired in 1974 after child abuse allegations arose.<br> <br> &#39;Became a hero&#39;<br> <br> Birt, who died four years ago, told the court Stein, then honorary president of the Boys&#39; Club, sacked Torbett as a result of the abuse claims. <br> <br> The BBC has spoken to three additional sources close to the events in the 1970s who support Birt&#39;s evidence to court that Torbett was ejected from the Boys&#39; Club by Stein, following complaints of child abuse.<br> <br> Stein was then the Celtic manager as well as honorary president of the Boys&#39; Club.<br> <br> Torbett returned to the Boys&#39; Club in around 1980 after Stein had left Parkhead. But no allegations against Torbett in his second period at the Boys&#39; Club have surfaced - until now.<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Controversies - Abuse at Boys' Clubs in Scotland - The Celtic Wiki" height="351" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/1e9071773cd7e5f5faeb8ef289440232/GW624H351" title="Controversies - Abuse at Boys' Clubs in Scotland - The Celtic Wiki" width="624"><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Controversies - Abuse at Boys' Clubs in Scotland - The Celtic Wiki" height="351" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/80078756c585256a7a02f479d7a6dbf3/GW624H351" title="Controversies - Abuse at Boys' Clubs in Scotland - The Celtic Wiki" width="624"><br> Kenny Campbell, now 44, joined Celtic Boy&#39;s Club in 1985 as a 13-year-old. A year later, he joined the U-14s, which was managed by Torbett.<br> <br> He said Torbett took a special interest in him and won the trust of his parents. <br> <br> Kenny told BBC Scotland: &quot;Pretty quickly he became a hero of mine. In my mind he was doing good things [for me].<br> <br> &quot;I&#39;d have jumped in front of a bus for him if he had asked me, guaranteed. So it was as if he had a hold over us.&quot;<br> <br> He said Torbett began the abuse while he was sitting on the couch with him one night.<br> <br> Kenny said this was the beginning of up to four years of sexual abuse at the hands of Torbett, which carried on even after he was signed by the senior Celtic team. <br> <br> The young player didn&#39;t tell anyone: &quot;I just thought it was natural. I just thought that was what happened,&quot; he said.<br><br> Kenny made about 20 appearances for the reserves at Celtic but illness effectively ended his Celtic career. His life spiralled into drink and drugs, but he is now clean and sober. <br> <br> He said he was angry that Torbett was allowed to return to Celtic Boys&#39; Club despite previous abuse claims. <br> <br> &quot;I feel aggrieved at that, eh, if they had never let him back in it would &hellip; never happened in the first place, I could have had a normal life, normal people round about me. If Celtic had done their due diligence &hellip; it wouldn&#39;t have happened to me.&quot;<br> <br> The BBC has spoken to a second former Celtic Boys&#39; Club player who alleges he was abused by Torbett for three years from 1990. <br> <br> Torbett&#39;s lawyer told the BBC he &quot;vehemently denies these completely false allegations&quot;.<br> <br> He added: &quot;Clearly allegations of this kind must remain in the hands of the police and due process of the law must be followed here.&quot;<br> <br> In a statement, Celtic FC said the club was &quot;fully committed to safeguarding children&quot;.<br> <br> Presented with award<br> <br> The statement went on: &quot;Celtic Boys&#39; Club was separate and distinct organisation from Celtic Football Club. It was vital that justice was served at that time, due to the extremely serious nature of this issue.&quot;<br> <br> The statement added that anyone with any concerns should contact the club.<br> <br> The BBC has discovered what appears to be the &quot;official&quot; account of why Torbett left the Boys&#39; Club in the archives of The Celtic View, which was the sanctioned, in-house magazine for Celtic FC. <br> <br> Dated November 1974, the report is headlined: &quot;Jim bows out&hellip;after another season of glory.&quot; It states that Torbett was leaving for his own personal and business reasons and is a glowing tribute to his time at the Boys&#39; Club. There is no mention of abuse allegations. <br> <br> The BBC understands the police were never called. <br> <br> The Celtic View archives also reveal that in 1977, three years after he allegedly threw Torbett out of the Boys&#39; Club, Jock Stein was pictured presenting Torbett with an award recognising his services to Celtic Boys&#39; Club.<br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Controversies - Abuse at Boys' Clubs in Scotland - The Celtic Wiki" height="351" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c02a5adc7ddfde405fc03af6327c59b0/GW624H351" title="Controversies - Abuse at Boys' Clubs in Scotland - The Celtic Wiki" width="624"><br> Jock Stein (left) presented Torbett (centre) with an award three years after he allegedly threw him out of the club.<br><br> On the same evening, according to the archives, Stein made way for Celtic board member Kevin Kelly as honorary president of the Boys&#39; Club. <br> <br> Birt would tell the court in 1998 that he attempted to prevent Torbett returning to the Boys&#39; Club and raised the issue with Celtic board members, including Kevin Kelly.<br> <br> Two other sources have told the BBC that when Torbett was allowed to return to the Boys&#39; Club in around 1980, Mr Kelly would have been aware of the previous claims of abuse against Torbett.<br> <br> Mr Torbett&#39;s company The Trophy Centre had a lucrative contract with Celtic to provide branded merchandising.<br> <br> Mr Kelly and Jack McGinn, a Celtic FC director from 1981, worked with Mr Torbett at his Trophy Centre business from 1986 and 1998 respectively. Their associations with the company continued long after Torbett was jailed for abuse.<br> <br> Mr Kelly strongly denies being aware of allegations concerning Torbett when he returned to the Boys&#39; Club, and told the BBC that he was not aware of any previous allegations against Torbett until his court case in the 1990s. <br> <br> Jack McGinn, a Celtic FC director from 1981, also denies any previous knowledge of Mr Torbett&#39;s offending prior to his second spell at the Boys&#39; club. <br> <br> Both Mr Kelly and Mr McGinn said that if they had been aware of Mr Torbett&#39;s prior offending, they would have done all they could to prevent him returning to Celtic Boys&#39; Club.<br> <br> &#39;I was raped&#39;<br> <br> Jon Cleland, an alleged victim of Gordon Neely, was a prodigious talent. In around 1981, at the age of 10, he joined Hutchison Vale FC, the Edinburgh football talent factory known for producing players like John Collins, Allan Preston and Leigh Griffiths.<br> <br> Neely was one of the coaches at the club. He was known for an ability to spot and develop youth talent, and was well thought of in Edinburgh football circles. <br> <br> Jon says he was soon targeted by Neely, and subjected to 18 months of serious sexual abuse.<br><br><br> Describing his first assault at Neely&#39;s hands, he said: &quot;He took me into a room at the back of our hall and told me to take my shorts down and he put me over his knee and he proceeded to spank me&hellip; I had done something wrong and it was my punishment. [I] didn&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;<br> <br> Jon&#39;s silence seemed to be Neely&#39;s cue to escalate the abuse. Jon was 11 at the time. <br> <br> He told BBC Scotland: &quot;He said I looked like I had had an injury&hellip; then he asked me to lean over a desk, and that&#39;s when I was raped.<br> <br> &quot;At that age, hadn&#39;t a clue what was going on.&quot; <br> <br> Jon said he was raped around 10 times over the next 18 months. Asked if he had been able to tell anyone, he said: &quot;No. I couldn&#39;t have possibly at that age. I thought it was my fault. I thought I had done something wrong.&quot;<br> <br> Jon began training with Hibs, but Neely was driving him to training, and abusing him in the car beforehand. <br> <br> He said: &quot;It was at that point that I couldn&#39;t do it, couldn&#39;t do it anymore. I couldn&#39;t face going to football training.&quot; <br> <br> Jon said he gave up football to escape the abuse.<br><br> Neely took up a youth development position with Hibs in around 1983. In about 1986, abuse allegations concerning him were put to the late Hibs chairman Kenny Waugh.<br> <br> Sports reporter Ray Hepburn told the BBC Waugh had confided in him.<br> <br> Mr Hepburn said: &quot;He said &#39;we&#39;ve had complaints by two sets of parents about Gordon Neely. And his behaviour with some of the boys&#39;.<br> <br> &quot;And of course it was quite devastating news. He went on to explain that he had sacked him that day, had reassured the parents by dealing with it in a very speedy and decisive way. And that was kind of the way people did things then.&quot;<br> <br> The BBC has also spoken to the then Hibs manager John Blackley who confirmed Hepburn&#39;s story that Waugh had been made aware of complaints. <br> <br> The police were never involved. Nor did anyone at Hibs warn Rangers about Neely&#39;s behaviour. <br> <br> Twenty whacks<br> <br> In a statement, Hibs said it was &quot;saddened to be told that personnel at the club at the time were allegedly made aware of concerns about Neely and, again allegedly, did not contact the police.<br> <br> &quot;[This] is something which current policies and practices would prevent from happening today,&quot; the statement said.<br> <br> Neely then moved to Rangers in 1986, where BBC Scotland learned the abuse continued. <br> <br> One former player told the programme: &quot;He had his own office inside Ibrox and he&#39;d call you in and he&#39;d make you close the door.<br> <br> &quot;He&#39;d pull your shorts and pants down and then he&#39;d spank you with like this rubber shoe. I mean I wasn&#39;t the only one. He&#39;d give you 10 or twenty whacks for anything. I was only about 13.&quot;<br> <br> <br> The programme also features claims from former Clydebank and Rangers player Levi Stephen (pictured now and as a boy) about a third alleged perpetrator <br> <br> Rangers told us it was aware of an alleged incident more than 25 years ago involving Neely, sacked him and informed the police. <br> <br> Police Scotland told the BBC they were unable to confirm whether Rangers made a complaint or not, despite Freedom of Information requests. <br> <br> The BBC also asked surviving senior executives and football personnel who were at Rangers at that time, for more details - but received none. The Crown was unable to find details of a report being sent to the fiscal in relation to a complaint about Neely in 1990. <br> <br> In a statement Rangers said: &quot;It is understood the individual was dismissed immediately and that the police were informed.<br> <br> &quot;All employees adhered to the strictest codes of conduct.&quot; <br> <br> The club added that it would &quot;always co-operate fully&quot; with the authorities.&quot;<br> <br> Several opportunities to put an end to Neely&#39;s abuse were wasted, according to BBC Scotland&#39;s investigation, and Neely simply changed tactics, by reinventing himself as coach doing one-to-one training and activity weekends in Dunkeld, and nearby Dalguise, in Perthshire for young footballers. <br> <br> One-to-one coaching<br> <br> A decade after Hibs sacked him, and more than five years after Rangers got rid of him it is alleged Neely was still abusing. <br> <br> &quot;Paul,&quot; (not his real name), told BBC Scotland: &quot;I was playing with one of the Edinburgh clubs [around 1995] and a man came up to me after a match. It was Gordon Neely. And he said he could make me a better player, and I needed some one-to-one coaching. Said he knew all the big players and managers. He was impressive. <br> <br> &quot;So every other weekend I&#39;d go up to Dunkeld. He told me I had a condition that was hampering me. And that he could help me with it.&quot;<br> <br> Paul was then abused by Neely.<br> <br> &quot;I knew it was wrong,&quot; he said. &quot;It went on for about 10 minutes each time but I couldn&#39;t do anything. I just froze.<br> <br> &quot;I didn&#39;t want to complain because I thought it would ruin the chances of me getting the trial he&#39;d promised me. So I just put up with it.&hellip; for almost three years.&quot;<br> <br> Gordon Neely died in 2014. <br> <br> The programme also features claims from former Clydebank and Rangers player Levi Stephen about a third alleged perpetrator.<br> <br> Stewart Regan, the chief executive of the Scottish FA said an independent review into allegations of historic child sexual abuse in Scottish football was under way. <br> <br> &quot;We await its findings,&quot; he added. <br> <br> &quot;The latest allegations are a matter for the investigatory authority, Police Scotland. <br> <br> &quot;We would urge anyone who has suffered abuse to come forward using the dedicated, confidential NSPCC 24-hour helpline 0800 023 2642, directly to the police on 101 or via email to the Scottish FA at childrenswellbeing@scottishfa.co.uk.&quot;<br> <br> Football Abuse: The Ugly Side of the Beautiful Game is being shown at 22:40 on BBC1 Scotland and will be available on the BBC iPlayer shortly afterwards.<br> <br> Additional reporting by Liam McDougall, Calum McKay and Martin Conaghan.<br> <br>   </font><font color="#000000" size="3"><br></font><br><h3>Celtic Sex fiend left me weeping in Norway </h3><div class="post-body entry-content">by Anna Smith<br><br>At  just 13, he was Celtic&#39;s youngest-ever signing and hailed as Scotland&#39;s  greatest prospect. But John McCluskey&#39;s dreams of stardom were  tarnished by Jim Torbett. The innocent lad was used for tawdry sex by  the manager during a boys&#39; club trip to Norway. And, when Torbett had  fulfilled his sick obsession, he left his victim alone, confused and  crying.<br><br>John, the brother of Parkhead favourite George McCluskey,  spoke yesterday of the agony he has felt for 23 years. Near tears, he  said: &quot;My guilt and shame now is not for what happened that night. My  shame is that I waited 23 years to do anything about it. &quot;Dunblane was  the one thing that made me come forward. If some of the boys abused by  Thomas Hamilton had spoken out, perhaps the massacre might not have  happened.&quot; Striker John was destined to be a Celtic great. At 12, he so  impressed Jock Stein that he was promised a place on the ground staff as  soon as he left school. A key player at Celtic Boys&#39; Club, John&#39;s  Lanarkshire home was littered with trophies and medals. But one Best  Player trophy fills him with revulsion each time he looks at it. It was  given him after the awful night in Norway that changed his life forever.  John said: &quot;Every time I look at that trophy, I wonder if I got it  because of what Torbett did to me. &quot;I&#39;ve always felt like throwing it in  a river. But, if I had, I&#39;d have had to tell everyone what happened.&quot;  Tears fill John&#39;s eyes as he relives the nightmare. He said: &quot;We were  lying in a dormitory talking about football -the usual stuff. &quot;Torbett  was sleeping in the dorm and shouted, `Fryer&#39; -my nickname -`go in that  room and sort the strips for tomorrow&#39;. &quot;But, when I went in, the strips  were already sorted. &quot;Torbett followed me in and sat me down on the  bed. He put his hand inside my pyjamas and fondled me. &quot;I was terrified.  I didn&#39;t know what to do. I just sat there and let him do it to me.  &quot;When I think of it now it makes me sick. &quot;He left, and I cried my eyes  out. I didn&#39;t want to go back among the boys and I didn&#39;t want to be by  myself. I was so frightened. &quot;Eventually I went back to bed and pulled  the covers over my head. &quot;I didn&#39;t know what to think. I thought there  must be something wrong with me and I must have enjoyed it, otherwise I  wouldn&#39;t have let him do it to me. &quot;So I was terrified to complain to  anyone.&quot;<br><br>John had been on other foreign trips with the boys&#39;  club. But he came back from Norway a different person. He said:  &quot;Everything had changed. But I was still determined to be a great  player. &quot;I trained hard and played really well. I don&#39;t know how, but I  was able to concentrate on my game.&quot; But he stayed away from Torbett. He  said: &quot;A crowd of boys used to go to his home all the time. I went  once, and that was enough for me. &quot;I saw him beat up a lad who played  with the boys&#39; club, but was about 17 and seemed to live with him. &quot;I  was horrified to see him slapping his face and punching him, yet the boy  did nothing to stop him. &quot;There was always talk around Celtic about  Torbett and boys, but nothing seemed to be done until Jock Stein found  out. &quot;He kicked Torbett out, but it was still kept quiet. &quot;All the  directors and lots of others knew why Torbett got the boot, but it was  swept under the carpet.&quot;<br><br>John soon became a young Scottish hero,  scoring the winner against England at Wembley in a 1975 schoolboy  international. All eyes were on the boy who was to be the new Kenny  Dalglish. But, two years later, a kick in training caused a blood clot  on his leg that destroyed his career. John made a brief comeback,  playing with Celtic&#39;s first team in a European tie when he was still 17.  But his injury recurred, and he hasn&#39;t played since. For nearly 20  years, he has watched former team-mates grab the trophies as his life  has become a tragic tale of booze and disappointment. John, who now  hasn&#39;t touched a drop in four years, reckons his injury helped push him  into drinking. But he is sure his biggest reason was to blot out the  memory of Torbett&#39;s abuse. He said: &quot;I started drinking after Norway.  Suddenly it looked like something I wanted to do. &quot;I was drinking  heavily from 17. It was the only way to forget what Torbett did. &quot;I was  shattered that my career had finished. But I could have lived with that  if it hadn&#39;t been for Norway. &quot;I&#39;m so glad I don&#39;t have sons. I would  have wanted to send them to Celtic Boys Club, but I would always have  wondered if some pervert was abusing them. &quot;It took me a long time to  come to terms with what happened and understand it wasn&#39;t my fault. &quot;But  there are still days when I suddenly find myself in tears. &quot;Nobody  should get away with what Torbett did. How many more boys have suffered  because of him? &quot;I still love Celtic. I go to Parkhead every week and  I&#39;ll be a Celtic man until I die. &quot;I only hope real Celtic fans will  understand why I have come forward. If I can help stop this happening to  one more boy, it will have been worthwhile.&quot;<br><br>TORBETT PLEADED AS  HIS VICTIM SOBBED A few days ago, John got a chilling phone call from  Torbett pleading his innocence. It came after John made a sworn  statement about the pervert to Celtic&#39;s lawyers, in the presence of club  supremo Fergus McCann. John said: &quot;I didn&#39;t even tell my brother George  about Torbett until last week. &quot;He was furious and wanted to do  something about it. I told him to leave it, that I was coping fine.  &quot;But, when he left the house, I just burst into tears. &quot;While I was  crying, the phone rang. It was Torbett. &quot;He said: `What are you doing to  me, son?&#39; &quot;I told him it was what he did to me that was the problem.  &quot;He said:`You know I never touched you, son. You know I loved you, and  your family.&#39; &quot;I was sick, just listening to him. &quot;I told him that I  hadn&#39;t gone to the police or the newspapers and he said, `I appreciate  that, son&#39;.&quot;<br><br>John told how a visit from the police, who were  investigating sex abuse allegations at Celtic Boys&#39; Club dating back  four years, finally made him come forward. He said: &quot;The police were  asking about someone else. &quot;I thought they wanted to talk about Torbett,  but they didn&#39;t, so I didn&#39;t tell them my story. &quot;I spoke to Tommy  Burns about it instead. He got me to make a statement to Fergus McCann  who asked me to make a statement to their lawyers. &quot;I have now done  that. I will also make a statement to the police.&quot;</div><div align="center">  </div><font face="Helvetica"><font color="#000000" size="3"> </font><br></font><h3>Celtic Boys Club founder Jim Torbett at centre of new sex abuse allegations revealed in BBC investigation</h3><div><br><font face="Helvetica"><a class="external" href="http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/new-allegations-sexual-abuse-against-10197571" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><font color="#0066cc" face="Helvetica">http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/new-allegations-sexual-abuse-against-10197571</font></a></font></div><div><font face="Helvetica">The BBC Scotland programme also spoke to more than 20 victims of known offenders who targeted players at Celtic, Rangers and Hibs<br><br>Victims of sexual abuse in football have spoken of how their lives were shattered by notorious sex predators in a shocking new documentary.<br><br>The BBC Scotland programme spoke to more than 20 victims of paedophiles and tells of missed opportunities by big clubs and police in stopping known offenders, who targeted boys at Celtic, Rangers and Hibs.<br><br>Tonight&#39;s programme, Football Abuse: The Ugly Side of the Beautiful Game, exposes the blatant methods of serial abusers like Celtic Boys Club founder Jim Torbett, who was initially brought to justice after an award winning Daily Record investigation in the 1980s.<br><br>It also reveals graphic accounts of abuse by former Rangers and Hibs coach Gordon Neely, from his time at both clubs and with youth club Hutchison Vale.<br><br>Alleged victims tell the programme that Torbett was allowed to return to Celtic after the club knew he was an abuser - enabling him to attack more victims.<br><br>Torbett was only ever convicted for crimes committed up to 1974 - but alleged victim Kenny Campbell claims he was abused after legendary manager Jock Stein left the club and Torbett was welcomed back in 1980.<br><br>Kenny, of Uddingston, moved to Celtic&rsquo;s reserves in 1989 after three years with Celtic Boys Club.

The police were never called.<br><br>The BBC has spoken to three additional sources close to the events in 1974 who support Birt&#39;s version of events.<br><br>But the &quot;official&quot; version of Torbett&#39;s departure can be found in the archives of the Celtic View, the sanctioned, in-house magazine for Celtic FC.<br><br>Dated November 1974, the report is headlined: &quot;Jim bows out&hellip;after another season of glory.&quot;<br><br>It states that Torbett was leaving for his own personal and business reasons and is a glowing tribute to his time at the Boys Club.<br><br>The then editor Jack McGinn told the BBC last year that all stories published in the magazine were done so in good faith, and denies allowing a false article to be published.<br>Image caption Jim Torbett was jailed in 1998 for crimes leading up to 1974<br><br>In 1998, Torbett was jailed for his crimes leading up to 1974.

Because of his previous association with the BBC, Torbett&#39;s defence sought to have the two BBC journalists involved in the programme banned from the courtroom for his evidence. The motion was repelled by Judge Beckett.<br><br>In two days of emotionally fraught evidence, Kenny described how Torbett had first groomed then abused him. When asked if he could see his abuser in the courtroom, he pointed towards the man in the dock - his former mentor, Jim Torbett.<br><br>Kenny got his wish and faced his abuser in court, but Andrew Gray did not get that opportunity.<br><br>Andrew, who would have been 43, had suffered from mental health problems since he was a teenager.<br><br>Ahead of the trial he had gone to visit his best friend in Australia for a few weeks to alleviate the pressure, but broke his neck in a freak swimming pool accident.<br>Image caption Andrew Gray&#39;s sister Michelle promised to tell his story after his death<br><br>His sister Michelle Gray travelled to his bedside while he was on life support.<br><br>She recalled: &quot;He had said, please get me out of here and get me back to Scotland as soon as you possibly can, words to this effect, so that I can make sure Torbett gets put away for the rest of his life.<br><br>&quot;And there was a communication made between [us] where we basically [said] if he didn&#39;t make it, that I would come back to Scotland and make sure people heard his story and do all I possibly can to make sure that Jim Torbett was convicted of the crimes that he committed and make sure this never happens again to any other football-mad child.&quot;<br><br>Andrew died 16 days later after his family took the decision to switch off his life support machine. Michelle was at his side.<br><br>She added: &quot;It&#39;s really important that we go&hellip; and we get justice for him because he&#39;s not here.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll never hear his voice again. We&#39;ll never be able to embrace him. We&#39;ll never be able to tell him how much he&#39;s loved but we can do this for him.<br><br>&quot;I would like [Tobett] to know the pain and suffering that he caused Andrew.<br><br>&quot;I would like him to also know that he destroyed his life and he is indirectly responsible for his death, that the course of actions that took place over the last 25/30 years and more so the last 18 months would never have happened if he had not done what he done to my brother.&quot;<br><br>During the trial Kenny and Andrew were described as liars and fantasists by Torbett, who produced as a defence witness William Gilbert, the man who tried to shield him during our confrontation in California.<br><br>Mr Gilbert had accompanied Torbett every day during this trial. When it was his turn to give evidence, his answers, according to the advocate depute, seemed &quot;rehearsed&quot;.<br><br>This jury, rightly, did not get to hear about Torbett&#39;s previous conviction.

A BBC Scotland investigation in 2017 revealed the extent of his abuse at those three clubs, including allegations that Hibs failed to pass on concerns about his behaviour when Neely moved to Rangers in 1986.<br><br>Neely would carry on abusing at Rangers until a complaint was made in 1991 which led to his dismissal.<br><br>Rangers told the BBC in 2017 that Neely was sacked and reported to the police.

Or we can do it my way which is that I&#39;ll take you in this office, pull your trousers down, and spank your bum&#39;&hellip; And I said: &#39;Well, we&#39;ll do it your way.&#39;<br><br>&quot;And he went and snibbed the door&hellip; took down my pants and he bent me over his knee and I can always remember his hand going up...<br><br>&quot;I shut my eyes expecting the thud. But just at that he said: &#39;That&#39;s enough&hellip; go and get changed and go for your training.&#39; So I don&#39;t know whether something&#39;s spooked him&hellip; but that&#39;s what he done.&#39;<br><br>&quot;I was&hellip; confused, a bit &#39;what just happened there? What have I done?&#39; I&#39;ve not done anything wrong. I was just, I couldn&#39;t believe it.&quot;<br>&#39;They didn&#39;t go the police&#39;<br><br>John told his parents. They phoned Ibrox and were invited to a meeting with the then manager and assistant manager, Graeme Souness and Walter Smith. He says the initial meeting took place in Souness&#39; car, across from Ibrox.<br><br>He says the meeting then continued in Souness&#39; office and Neely was brought in and confronted.<br><br>John said: &quot;[Neely&#39;s] face just fell when he saw me. Mr Souness said: &#39;This boy says you had him over your knee.&#39; He said: &#39;No I didn&#39;t boss, no, no.&#39; I broke down and said: &#39;You did so.&#39;<br><br>Neely later confessed, and Souness sacked him on the spot.<br><br>Since 2016, Rangers has insisted it also reported Neely to the police.<br>Image caption Neely had a youth development role with Hibs in the early 1980s<br><br>&quot;Total lies,&quot; said John. &quot;No, they didn&#39;t go the police.<br><br>&quot;When I made my statement to the police [in 2016] they said they couldn&#39;t find any trace of any record at all going back to what Rangers are saying.<br><br>&quot;Nobody came to speak to me either when I was that age. That&#39;s how I know nothing was reported to the police.&quot;<br><br>Martin Henry, who led the SFA review into child abuse in football, told the BBC his review had been &quot;unable to confirm either way whether an actual formal report was made to Strathclyde police at that time&quot;.<br>Wished &#39;every success in the future&#39;<br><br>But despite Rangers&#39; claims that Neely was sacked and reported to the police, that&#39;s not what they told the public.<br><br>In an edition of the in-house weekly newspaper Rangers News on 20 March 1991, a story titled &quot;Neely Moves On&quot; appears on page two.<br><br>It states that Neely &quot;resigned last week after spending four years at Ibrox&quot;.<br><br>It continues: &quot;Neely, who was previously with Dundee United and Hibernian, has decided to go into business.<br><br>&quot;The club wishes him every success in the future.&quot;<br>Image caption The article appeared in Rangers News in March 1991<br><br>When shown the article, John told the BBC: &quot;Well, there you go. On one hand they tell you they went to the police. And on the other hand, he went with their best wishes. A paedophile? Unbelievable. A cover-up.&quot;<br><br>Martin Henry said the article was &quot;concerning,&quot; and was &quot;new information&quot; that his review had not previously been aware of.<br><br>He added: &quot;It would concern me if any institution knew that somebody presented a potential risk to young people and didn&#39;t follow it up with due care. And from what I&#39;ve read, that appears to be the case.<br><br>&quot;I can only construe it could well be that this was a public relations attempt to just explain Mr Neely&#39;s departure and to do it in a way that was as less compromising as possible.&quot;<br><br>Mr Henry&#39;s full SFA report will be published this year.<br><br>Rangers did not respond to a request for a comment from BBC Scotland, instead it issued a statement to The Herald.<br><br>A spokesman for club said: &quot;Rangers based its prior description as to what occurred on trusted first-hand accounts from those with personal knowledge of what took place and the appropriate steps taken at that time.<br><br>&quot;To suggest... that these are invalidated by a short, filler piece in the Rangers News written almost 30 years ago by someone who clearly had no knowledge of the events, or the reasons for Neely&#39;s sacking is nonsense.&quot;<br><br>He added: &quot;Rangers will do all it can to assist in offering support and counselling to anyone affected. Their wellbeing should be at the centre of every right thinking person&#39;s concern.&quot;<br>&#39;It takes something away from you&#39;<br>Image copyright PA Media<br><br>A week or two after Neely left the club, John says that another coach came into the Ibrox dressing room to speak to his team.<br><br>John said the man barged in and said: &quot;Right, there&#39;s somebody in here, and you know who you are, that&#39;s been telling lies about my best friend.&quot;<br><br>John said: &quot;I knew straight away it was me they were referring to&hellip; I just put my head down.<br><br>&quot;I didn&#39;t go back. How could I?<br><br>&quot;It affected me. I came back to football, to Dundee United, but [on] maybe my second training session there was something missing. I didn&#39;t want it.<br><br>&quot;It takes something away from you - trust. I decided to stop. I just lost interest, I suppose.&quot;<br>&#39;I hope lessons can be learned&#39;<br><br>In 2017 the BBC revealed that Neely went into private coaching after leaving Rangers, and continued to abuse well into the 1990s.<br><br>Another former youth player says he was abused by Neely for four year during the 1990s, at Neely&#39;s home in Perthshire.<br><br>He told the BBC: &quot;It is very disappointing to learn that Gordon Neely appears to have been protected from investigation by the clubs&hellip; leaving him free to continue to abuse children and young adults.<br><br>&quot;The fact Neely was able to continue to promote himself as a trusted and respected youth coach directly created a situation which led to my abuse.<br><br>&quot;Considering Neely&#39;s death, my only hope is that lessons can be learned from this and that clubs involved in abuse will be investigated to find out how this was allowed to happen.&quot;<br>&#39;I&#39;d like an apology&#39;<br><br>John, who is now in his 40s, is pursuing a legal claim against Rangers. His lawyer, Daniel Canning from Thompsons, told the BBC: &quot;Our client has shown great courage in coming forward and speaking about his experience as a child at Rangers. It was not an easy thing for him to do.<br><br>&quot;Secrecy, misinformation and a failure to take decisive action have always been the circumstances that have allowed child abuse to take place and abusers to continue abusing.&quot;<br><br>Neely died in 2014 from cancer and never faced justice.<br><br>But John says that some things could still be put right.<br><br>&quot;I was only a wee boy at the time. [It&#39;ll be] 29 years next March&hellip; I&#39;d like an apology - but will I see that? Probably not.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><font face="Helvetica"><br></font></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3><br><br><br><span class="diffRemove">  </span></div>
