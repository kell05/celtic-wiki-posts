With a defeat that reduces their lead in the Premier League to a single point and two players - Alan Thompson and Chris Sutton - sent off, the Scottish champions&#39; renowned fortitude showed distinct signs of wear and tear.<br><br>The Parkhead side clearly felt they had cause for complaints about referee Kenny Clark&#39;s handling of an extraordinarily eventful renewal of the old fixture and they were voiced unambiguously afterwards by Martin O&#39;Neill.<br><br>The Celtic manager was especially aggrieved by the ordering-off of Thompson, whose head movement towards Peter Lovenkrands in the 38th minute appeared to be more of a menacing gesture than a physical act. The Dane collapsed on the turf and was cautioned for overreacting, but Thompson was shown a straight red card.<br><br>O&#39;Neill, in condemning Lovenkrands&#39; action, suggested that the Rangers player would not be proud of himself on seeing a replay. The Celtic manager also intimated that he would appeal against the Thompson dismissal and asserted that &#39;the video review panel will want to have a look at a number of incidents&#39;.<br><br>This was a reference to the actions of Nacho Novo, whose kick at Jackie McNamara very early in the match was missed by the match officials, but highlighted by television. Novo was also involved with the substitute Stephen Pearson, appearing to land on the midfielder feet first. Pearson, perhaps significantly, made nothing of the incident, suggesting that he regarded it as accidental.<br><br>Novo, whose appeal against an ordering-off against Hibs at Easter Road was upheld only the day before, inflicted more punishment on Celtic by not only avoiding another dismissal for the apparent swipe at McNamara, but by scoring the first goal from a penalty, followed by Dado Prso&#39;s clincher close to the interval.<br><br>That opening goal was a direct result of the kind of ill-conceived and irresponsible defending that has made Celtic unusually vulnerable over the course of the past two months. The latest in a series of aimless balls forward from midfield into the visitors&#39; box was heading straight for Magnus Hedman in goal when Bobo Balde, foolishly, decided to intercept.<br><br>Having chosen the wrong option, the big defender compounded the error with a weak header straight to Hamed Namouchi, who slipped the ball quickly to Novo. As the Spaniard tried to gain control, Joos Valgaeren, continuing the rashness theme, slid in and took his feet. Novo converted calmly and expertly, sliding the shot low to the left of Hedman.<br><br>That would be the first of a number of shocks for the Celtic support, who had seen their team generally take control of the match, enjoying a pronounced advantage in possession and territorial gains, even if there was a bluntness about their attacking efforts whenever they moved towards Stefan Klos.<br><br>Apart from a header by Stanislav Varga from a corner by Stilian Petrov - the ball dropping just wide of the goalkeeper&#39;s left post - neither side appeared especially threatening before the free-kick from which Rangers doubled their advantage. It was the kind of delivery, from Fernando Ricksen on the left, that the giants in the Celtic defence should have handled without fuss, but it was Prso who managed the header among the group of players who challenged, the ball looping high to the right of Hedman and dropping over the line.<br><br>O&#39;Neill&#39;s response to his team&#39;s predicament was predictable. He removed the disappointing Henri Camara, brought Pearson off the bench and pushed Sutton forward to lend his considerable weight to the attack.<br><br>The big Englishman, who has been a consistently telling influence for the Parkhead side since his arrival in Glasgow, on this occasion rewarded his manager with the most foolish ordering-off imaginable. Having been cautioned in the first half for a high challenge on Alex Rae, Sutton lasted only 11 minutes of the second before reaching out to handle a header from Marvin Andrews back to Klos.<br><br>His second yellow card was inevitable. From then on, Celtic operated on a purely improvisational basis, with players assuming roles dependent on where the ball was and on the kind of opportunities that opened up. Defenders were frequently seen in attack and vice versa.<br><br>Unsurprisingly, Rangers were afforded the luxury of maintaining their original deployment, with the result that they carried more threat on those occasions when they chose to try to exploit the space in the visitors&#39; defence. It would be the first time since their 5-1 victory early in O&#39;Neill&#39;s first season at Celtic that the Ibrox side would be able to complete the entire final third of an Old Firm match worry-free.<br><br><h3>Inquiry into Old Firm mayhem</h3><br> Graham Clark at Ibrox Park<br> The Guardian, Monday 22 November 2004 23.03 GMT<br><br>The Scottish Football Association&#39;s video-review panel is to examine a series of incidents from this Old Firm game, one which descended into even more mayhem and madness than usual.<br><br>The film, moreover, will be X-rated. It was not a pretty sight as Celtic&#39;s Alan Thompson and Chris Sutton were sent off, Rangers&#39; defender Bob Malcolm was spoken to by the police, six others were booked and Martin O&#39;Neill was accused by some of a making a provocative gesture at the end, when he put his arm around his captain Neil Lennon and raised a clenched fist in front of the visiting fans.<br><br>There was also a plethora of other incidents which officialdom, match officials and police, turned a blind eye to.<br><br>There was Peter Lovenkrands&#39;s shameful exaggeration of the effects of Thompson&#39;s head movement that saw the Celtic player sent off, there was a stamp from Henri Camara on Gregory Vignal that was ignored, there were Nacho Novo&#39;s tackles on Jackie McNamara and Stephen Pearson that deserved red cards and there was Lennon&#39;s running feud with just about everyone, including the Rangers manager Alex McLeish and home fans, when he appeared to spit on a scarf thrown on to the track.<br><br>There are also rumours of a half-time bust-up involving Sutton and Lovenkrands although players, officials and police are keeping their counsel on that.<br><br>It will be Celtic who are principally in the dock in what was, footballing and discipline-wise, an untypical performance. Rangers were no innocents but by and large they kept their cool and that allowed them to win courtesy of a Novo penalty and a Dado Prso header to move within a point of the visitors.<br><br>Football, though, broke out sporadically and Jean-Alain Boumsong enhanced his growing reputation. The French defender, a target for Newcastle in January, was left bewildered by events but insisted he had no problem with O&#39;Neill&#39;s post-match antics with Lennon.<br><br>&quot;Before I came here from Auxerre I was told about this fixture, and it was mad [today],&quot; he said. &quot;But it is maybe the best derby in the world and I am proud to have been involved.<br><br>&quot;As for Mr O&#39;Neill&#39;s actions, they showed he is a good manager and is supportive of his players. I just hope there will not be a spirit of vengeance or revenge in future matches. The next game will be important but it is not right to get angry and become crazy. We need the fighting spirit, but we don&#39;t actually need to fight.&quot;<br><br><h3>Rangers 2-0 Celtic</h3><br>Alan Thompson was sent off by referee Kenny Clark<br>O&#39;Neill critical of Gers players<br>McLeish wants more<br>Ibrox photo gallery<br>Alan Thompson and Chris Sutton saw red as Rangers narrowed the gap to one point at the top of the SPL by winning a stormy Old Firm derby.<br><br>Spanish striker Nacho Novo drove Rangers ahead from the penalty spot after being felled by Joos Valgaeren.<br><br>Croatia striker Dado Prso&#39;s header from a Fernando Ricksen cross made it 2-0.<br><br>Celtic were reduced to 10 men when Thompson head-butted Peter Lovenkrands and Sutton followed after the break for two handballs in quick succession.<br><br>Rangers had ended a seven-match losing streak in Old Firm games by knocking Celtic out of the CIS Insurance Cup at Ibrox 10 days previously.<br><br>But Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill could this time include Sutton and was able to recall fit-again Stilian Petrov, although Didier Agathe was out injured.<br><br><br>Have Your Say<br>Chat about the Old Firm game<br>The visitors started brightly and Henri Camara hit the crossbar in the sixth minute from point-blank range, but a foul was given against John Hartson in the build up.<br><br>Rangers went ahead after 15 minutes, when Joos Valgaeren tripped Novo in the box.<br><br>The Spaniard, able to start after having a red card received last weekend downgraded to a yellow, slotted the spot-kick into the corner of the net.<br><br>Rangers substitute Bob Malcolm, dropped to allow Alex Rae to return to midfield, was led up the tunnel by police for what appeared to be viewed as an obscene gesture in celebration.<br><br>Dado Prso celebrates after scoring Rangers&#39; second goal<br>Dado Prso scored Rangers&#39; second goal<br>Celtic dominated possession and Stanislav Varga headed a couple of feet wide from a corner.<br><br>But the reigning champions fell further behind after 36 minutes, Prso heading home from 12 yards following a free-kick from Ricksen.<br><br>Thompson was sent off after squaring up to Lovenkrands, who over-reacted to the contact and was subsequently booked, the Rangers forward having fouled Jackie McNamara.<br><br>Camara, already on a yellow card, was lucky not to follow after lashing out at Vignal and was replaced with Stephen Pearson at half-time.<br><br>Celtic goalkeeper Magnus Hedman prevented a third goal, twice turning close-range efforts from Prso for a corner.<br><br>Sutton was sent off for a second bookable offence after twice deliberately handling the ball in one movement within the Rangers penalty box in the 56th minute.<br><br>Nine-man Celtic still managed to threaten, Stilian Petrov firing straight at Stefan Klos from 14 yards.<br><br>Hamed Namouchi missed a glorious chance to make it 3-0, driving the ball wide from 12 yards.<br><br>Rangers: Klos, Khizanishvili (Malcolm 71), Andrews, Boumsong, Vignal (Ball 59), Namouchi, Ricksen, Alex Rae, Lovenkrands (Arveladze 45), Prso, Novo.<br>Subs Not Used: Graeme Smith, Thompson, Hutton, MacKenzie.<br><br>Booked: Lovenkrands, Alex Rae, Khizanishvili.<br><br>Goals: Novo 15 pen, Prso 36.<br><br>Celtic: Hedman, McNamara, Balde, Varga, Valgaeren, Petrov (McGeady 79), Sutton, Lennon, Thompson, Hartson, Camara (Pearson 45).<br>Subs Not Used: Marshall, Juninho Paulista, Lambert, Wallace, Lawson.<br><br>Sent Off: Thompson (38), Sutton (56).<br><br>Booked: Camara, Sutton, Lennon, McNamara.<br><br>Att: 50,043<br><br>Ref: K Clark<br><br><h3>O&#39;Neill hits out at Gers players</h3> BBC<br>Rangers 2-0 Celtic<br>Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill hit out at Rangers&#39; Nacho Novo and Peter Lovenkrands after the defeat at Ibrox.<br><br>&quot;Novo was let off a red card, probably rightly, after last weekend, but he lashed out Jackie NcNamara early on,&quot; said O&#39;Neill.<br><br>&quot;The second incident, stamping on Stephen Pearson, was really terrible.<br><br>&quot;Alan Thompson was hard done-by in being sent off as Lovenkrands made a meal of it. The effort we put in with nine men was fantastic.&quot;<br><br>Thompson moved his head towards Lovenkrands&#39; face and the Danish forward collapsed to the ground.<br><br>&quot;I don&#39;t think Lovenkrands will be too pleased to have a look at the outcome again,&quot; said O&#39;Neill.<br><br><br>Henri Camara was very lucky to survive<br>Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill<br>&quot;I think there are grounds for appeal. I&#39;m quite sure the review panel will be looking at a lot of incidents from this afternoon.&quot;<br><br>O&#39;Neill did concede that one other incident that is sure to attract the attention of the Scottish FA panel had shown one of his players in a poor light.<br><br>Striker Henri Camara had been booked for thrusting an arm into Alex Rae&#39;s face but somehow escaped further punishment despite kicking Gregory Vignal in front of a linesman.<br><br>&quot;Henri Camara was very lucky to survive as that was in retaliation,&quot; O&#39;Neill admitted.<br><br>The Celtic manager blamed referee Kenny Clark for letting the game get out of hand.<br><br>&quot;I was not best pleased to be honest,&quot; he said. &quot;I thought he was poor.&quot;<br><br>O&#39;Neill added to the controversy by parading midfielder Neil Lennon, who had been involved in a verbal bust-up with Rangers manager Alex McLeish, during the game and was booed constantly by the Rangers fans.<br><br>&quot;Neil Lennon, for whatever reasons, suffers dogs abuse at every single away ground and in particular here obviously,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;He is well thought of by the Celtic fans for what he has done for us over the last four-and-a-half years.<br><br>&quot;It was to show that Neil Lennon is very popular with our fans and I didn&#39;t want anyone to forget that.&quot;<br><br><h3>Martin O&#39;Neill expects Thompson to be cleared</h3>Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill insists Alan Thompson&#39;s red card will be reversed by the Scottish FA.<br><br>The midfielder was sent off during Saturday&#39;s stormy Old Firm match after allegedly head-butting Rangers winger Peter Lovenkrands.<br><br>Celtic lodged their appeal on Tuesday, leaving the matter in the hands of the SFA&#39;s Video Review Panel who will study the incident.<br><br>O&#39;Neill said: &quot;I fully expect Alan to be cleared.&quot;<br><br>The Thompson sending off is likely to be looked at by the Video Review Panel on Friday.<br><br>O&#39;Neill claims that previous appeals involving Rangers striker Nacho Novo and Inverness Caledonian Thistle winger Juanjo suggest his player will be exonerated.<br><br>&quot;We will be appealing Alan Thompson&#39;s red card and, with precedence having been set in the cases involving both Novo and the Caley player (Juanjo), we would expect the appeal to succeed,&quot; added O&#39;Neill.<br><br>Juanjo was cleared of head-butting Celtic&#39;s Neil Lennon in a game in August, while Novo had his sending off appeal upheld by the SFA after allegedly aiming a kick at Hibernian&#39;s Craig Rocastle during a recent SPL match.<br><br>O&#39;Neill went on: &quot;Players square up to each other all the time in football - hardly a game goes past without people &#39;locking horns,&#39; if you will - and, provided there is no butting involved, it never results in a sending off.&quot;<br><br>&quot;To say that what Alan did was worthy of a red card regardless is just nonsense.&quot;<br><br>Meanwhile, Lovenkrands has attempted to play down the significance of the flash-points which littered Saturday&#39;s derby.<br><br>&quot;Everybody knows that in these games stuff happens and there is always going to be trouble,&quot; the Dane told Rangers World.<br><br>&quot;We didn&#39;t expect it to be as much as there was and in this game it was way over the top probably.<br><br>&quot;But that&#39;s the game nowadays. This sort of thing always happens in these sort of games so we just have to forget and get on with it.&quot;<br><br>If cleared of any wrong-doing, Thompson would be free to play in Celtic&#39;s SPL tie against Dundee on Sunday.<br><br>Celtic invited to make complaint<br><br><h3>Martin O&#39;Neill</h3>Rangers hit back at &#39;racist&#39; slur<br>Police investigate Novo threat<br>Old Firm investigation underway<br>The Scottish Football Association has invited Celtic to make an official complaint about the alleged racist abuse of Neil Lennon by Rangers fans.<br><br>Martin O&#39;Neill claimed Lennon was subjected to verbal abuse of a &quot;racial and sectarian manner&quot;.<br><br>An SFA statement said: &quot;All sectarian and racist chants are wrong, no matter who they are targeted at.<br><br>&quot;If Celtic, or any club, wish to make a complaint there are recognised avenues which can be followed within football.&quot;<br><br>However, Rangers fans are demanding an apology from O&#39;Neill.<br><br>John Macmillan, the general secretary of the Rangers Supporters Association, described O&#39;Neill&#39;s claims as &quot;outrageous&quot;.<br><br>&quot;The authorities should be calling him up to explain those remarks,&quot; he added.<br><br>But the Scottish FA statement added: &quot;Martin O&#39;Neill will not be charged with bringing the game into disrepute.&quot;<br><br>Rangers fans are demanding an apology from Celtic boss Martin O&#39;Neill after he accused them of directing racist abuse at Neil Lennon.<br><br>O&#39;Neill caused controversy when he led Lennon to the travelling contingent and repeatedly punched the air.<br><br>He explained later: &quot;I applauded the crowd because the support was fantastic and because Neil Lennon was abused from start to finish.<br><br>&quot;I think I had a right to show some support. He was verbally abused in a racial and sectarian manner.&quot;<br><br>Lennon, often the subject of invective at away grounds, was booed at every turn in a match that saw Celtic pair Alan Thompson and Chris Sutton ordered off.<br><br>And police are investigating claims Lennon made comments to fans and spat on a Rangers scarf which was thrown on to the side of the pitch during the match.</div>
