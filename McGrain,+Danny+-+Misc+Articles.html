Well, just to prove that boneheaded-ness is not  confined to the support of Ibrox and more than occasionally finds its  way along the corridors of power, the coaching staff at Rangers  concluded that this boy was not genetically or racially pure enough to  wear a blue jersey and ignored him, leaving the way open to that famous  Protestant called Jock Stein to sign yet another Protestant for a Club  that did not employ such a bigoted, ignorant policy.<br><br>Danny was  one of the Quality Street Kids who learned their football in the  background during the late 1960s when the first team was winning  everything in Scotland and impressing England and Europe as well.<br><br>He  joined the Club when he was 17 on May 13th 1967 (12 days before THAT  day of days) and stayed with the Club until 1987. During the intervening  20 years he played 657 times for Celtic and earned 62 caps for  Scotland. He won seven League Championship medals, five Scottish Cup  medals and two League Cup medals. He was the captain of the team from  the late 1970s onwards.<br><br>He was unfortunate in that he was often  the only player of real class at Parkhead at that time. The rest of the  team were GOOD players (deservedly playing for Scotland, for example and  winning medals for Celtic and other clubs), but Danny was a GREAT  player - and it showed. He was a superb athlete, a great competitor and  an inspiring captain, and thoroughly deserved his M.B.E. from the Queen  in 1983.<br><br>Yet it might never have been had he not also shown the  world his qualities of resilience that allowed him to recover from three  problems that would have floored a lesser man. One was a fractured  skull sustained more or less as he was breaking into the Celtic team on  March 25th 1972, but from which he had recovered by the start of the  following season; another was his being diagnosed as a diabetic and the  necessity of insulin injections. Once again he showed the world what he  is made of and remains an example to others who suffer from that  distressing condition, and then there was that mysterious ankle injury  which knocked him out of the 1977-78 season when Celtic really needed  him and out of the 1978 World Cup disaster in Argentina, where it is  hard to believe that his calming influence would not have been  beneficial in that crazy Scotland set-up.<br><br>He was always a  Glaswegian with the Glaswegian sense of humour. No great speechmaker, he  nevertheless told the story about how he was attending a reserve  football match and was spotted and recognised by a Rangers fan. The  bluenose was about to launch into a tirade about the Pope, Fenians etc.  before he remembered that this was not appropriate for the Protestant  Danny. Danny then says, &quot;He searched what there was of a brain before  shouting &#39;McGrain, you diabetic bastard!&quot;<br><br>He also looks back with  affection on his early days of working with Jock Stein, whom he called  &quot;Mr.Stein&quot; when wanting a pass in a bounce game when Jock joined in. He  looks back nostalgically on his peers &quot;Davie Hay, George Connelly, Vic  Davidson ... and there was a young lad called Dalglish, I think his name  was, that played as well!&quot;<br><br>Those who saw Danny McGrain in his  prime will say without any doubt that he was the best right back of his  and possibly of all time. Yet he could play at left back as well,  performing equally creditably. He was a complete footballer with  everything except an ability to shoot - but then again, he would never  have claimed to be a forward. Indeed his modesty was one of his more  endearing characteristics, for he was never big headed enough to feel  that Celtic and Scotland were not good enough for him and that he should  move south to England.<br><br>He remained until his retirement Danny McGrain of Celtic and Scotland.<br><br>In  later years he was manager of Hamilton Accies and Arbroath, but like  Alec McNair of old, he simply was too nice a man for the nastiness of  managing a Scottish football club.<br><br>Danny is now of course an integral member of the Celtic Youth Academy&#39;s coaching staff. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Danny Leaves Celtic as a Player</h3>Football: McGrain departs   <br>Times, The (London, England)<br>May 14, 1987<br><br>The   Scottish international full back, Danny McGrain has been given a free   transfer by Celtic, ending a 20-year association with the club.

The   owner of a fine-follicled face-hugger himself, McGrain was   understandably anxious before the trip, recalling that &quot;there was a lot   in the press about beards being banned there.&quot; <br><br>As it  transpired,  no one told McGrain to shave it off and he went on to play  in a 1-0  defeat. &quot;I would have done it if they had asked, but I had  actually seen  a few people with them,&quot; added the Celtic legend, whose  side  subsequently ran out 4-1 winners in the return game. &quot;It was a  little  intimidating too because when we went outside there were only  men in the  streets and no women to be seen, but there was no bother at  all.&quot;<br><br>Right-back  McGrain went on to win 62 caps for Scotland,  before moving into  management at Arbroath, where his fancy chin-warmer  came to prominence  again. &quot;I&#39;ll never forget how the fans took to Danny  McGrain and his  beard,&quot; recalled then-chairman John Christison of the  so-called <b>&#39;Danny McGrain&#39;s Bearded Army&#39;</b>. <br><br>&quot;It  was crazy -  but brilliant. They would all wear their own beards and we  had 700  T-shirts printed up. They sold out in three days.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Danny McGrain (becoming a Bhoy)</h3>CelticFC.net <br>March 2012 &amp; Nov 2013<br><br><b>Before you joined the club&rsquo;s youth system, where were you playing football? </b><br>I    played for Queen&rsquo;s Park Strollers, which would be under-18s, along   with  Scottish schools. I played for the school in the morning and   Queen&rsquo;s  Park in the afternoon, which I never found tiring at that age,   although  it shouldn&rsquo;t have been tiring around 16 or 17. Apparently,   Tommy  Reilly, Mr Stein&rsquo;s friend, came to watch Scottish schools with   Sean  Fallon, when we got hammered 4-1 by England schoolboys. I had just    turned 17 at this time. Sean Fallon came up to my house in Drumchapel    and wanted me to sign. Up to then, people were saying to me that I   could  be a professional footballer, but I never thought I would be a   player.  So when Sean Fallon came up to sign me on a part-time basis, I   thought I  needed to stay on at school. But he said that they would  send  me to  college as I wanted to be a mechanical engineer &ndash; that was  my  hope. But I  had to get a Higher in Maths. I got an O-level Maths  but  couldn&rsquo;t  understand Higher Maths. The club sent me to Reid Kerr  College  for a  year and I still couldn&rsquo;t understand it. At the same  time, Kenny  was  training to be an apprentice joiner. It never worked  out for me  and I  don&rsquo;t think Kenny was enjoying being an apprentice  joiner so when  the  year was out, me and Kenny decided to go and ask Mr  Stein to go   full-time. <br><br><b>Was it difficult juggling football and college when you were part-time? </b><br>I    played Junior that year as the club wanted you to go out and get    experience, and I learned to look after myself. Kenny was lucky and went    to Cumbernauld, a brand new club with a new park. I went to Maryhill    Juniors, an old club with an old park, and got kicked from pillar  post. I   never really enjoyed it. We never won one game in six months &ndash;  it was   that bad I got voted Player of the Year! Kenny was at  Cumbernauld,   scoring goals every week and was just a natural  goalscorer. It wasn&rsquo;t   until years down the road that I realised what I  had learned there. I   learned how to look after myself and improve my  awareness of the game.   That was why Mr Stein wanted us to go there.  Wherever you play, you   always have to learn something, be it a good  game, a bad game or an   indifferent game, and take something from it. I  was taking things in but   wasn&rsquo;t aware that I was doing it. <br><br><b>How did it feel to sign for the club? </b><br>I think it was relief as I didn&rsquo;t have to do any more Maths! I didn&rsquo;t have to try and get into the mechanical engineering. <br><br><b>With    the club lifting the European Cup days after you joined, and  regularly   competing for top honours, it must have been an exciting  time to be a   young player at Celtic? </b><br>Of course and we reached  the  European  Cup final in 1970 as well. I made my debut that year and  Kenny  and I  went to the final, not as boot boys but for experience.  How many   chances do people get to go to a European Cup final with a  team? Again   that was the type of manager Mr Stein was. It was great to  see the   preparation but then we lost to Feyenoord, which was awful  for us as the   first-team were our pals now. Dutch football had been in  its infancy   but unknown to us it was growing. They came and took  over, and played us   off the park that night.<br><br><b>What were those first weeks like?</b><br>We    did go full-time and we signed the week after Lisbon and the  following   week we were in training with theses guys. To go from being  at college   at 17 or 18, from Drumchapel, and go all the way to Celtic  Park and   train altogether as one group with the Lions was amazing. I  just   remember the first pre-season running around the track and  running and   running&hellip;with these older guys and names that I heard of  like Big Billy   and Bobby. We thought we could outrun them. We did some  hard work and   Big Billy was just passing me as if I was stuck in mud  and I was giving   it everything. That was my first introduction. I went  from there and   three years later I made my debut. <br><br><b>Were you ever intimidated when you walked into a dressing room occupied by such household names?</b><br>No,    because when we first arrived we trained together. We were one squad.    It wasn&rsquo;t a first-team squad and reserve squad, so we got to know  each   other. We would play games together. You would be playing  alongside and   against the likes of wee Jimmy, Bobby, Big Billy and  Bertie. You can&rsquo;t   become friends as we were too young but you just to  know them, so when   you made your first-team debut it was still a  daunting task but you   weren&rsquo;t as nervous. They were still the Lisbon  Lions, you still had a   great respect for them, and I have great deal  to thank them for. For me,   Kenny, Victor and Paul to be able to play  with these guys was like   being at Yale University for football. We had  to take everything from   it, and I thing we did that. <br><br><b>What it was like being part of such a talented group of young players at the club? </b><br>I    think Jock Stein and Sean Fallon gave everyone the confidence that   they  could make it. The whole Lisbon team were ahead of us and it might   be  another five years before I could even try and get into the   first-team.  Originally, I was a midfielder who would run about   everywhere, and Mr  Stein and Sean Fallon put players in various   positions in the reserve  team &ndash; I think I played every position apart   from centre forward and  centre-half. After two or three years, Mr Stein   thought I would be a  full-back. However, I never thought I could be a   full-back as I always  thought that full-backs had to be hard tacklers   and good defenders but  once I played there I was comfortable. At that   time, I was playing with  Kenny, Vic Davidson, Lou Macari and Paul   Wilson &ndash; all guys who made it  into the first-team. And because we all   made it into the first-team, it  made it a bit easier to come into.   Because we had come through together,  you knew what kind of passes they   wanted and what they liked.<br><br><b>Was it a good grounding to play in that reserve set-up before you went into the first-team?</b><br>Charlie    Gallagher played alongside us a lot and he was a very good player.  You   learned from him and there would be others who would play when  they  were  coming back from injury. Davie Cattanach was there most of  the  time as  well and he was a rough and ready defender who was very   enthusiastic. It  was good for us to see someone who was perhaps out the   picture but  still had great enthusiasm for the club and still worked   hard. He also  takes a bit of credit for our knowledge of the game. <br><br><b>After    signing for the club back in 1967, could you have ever imagined  having   such an illustrious career and still being at the club nearly  45 years   later? </b><br>I was quite happy getting the first day over  with  and  the games out of the way! Nobody ever thinks that&rsquo;s going to  happen.   But it&rsquo;s been enjoyable. I left in &rsquo;87 and never came back  until &rsquo;97. I   still kept in touch and still watched the games &ndash; but I  don&rsquo;t count   those 10 years, they never existed! So it&rsquo;s been a long  time but I have   enjoyed every day of it. <br><br><b>Greatest player I played alongside </b><br>Obviously    I   played with the whole Lisbon Lions team and each and every one of    them   were great players, and wee Jimmy Johnstone has been voted the    best   player ever so who am I to say he&acute;s not. Bobby Lennox was a  great    player  and they all were to have won the European Cup. Of my  era,   Kenny   Dalglish was the best to play with for his attributes of    passing,   creating goals and scoring goals himself &ndash; he would be up    there. Kenny&acute;s   greatest asset was his brain and his use of    physicality. He very  rarely  got injured. When he played up here he was    just fantastic, and  while we  as players never took him for granted,    the Scottish football  media did.  When he did go there was a big gap   in  our football up here.  He replaced  Kevin Keegan, who people  thought   was irreplaceable, and he  actually  overtook Kevin Keegan in  the  minds  of Liverpool supporters. He  blossomed  playing with better   players in a  better league, and grew  into a giant  of football.<br><br><b>Toughest opponent</b><br>I     always  thought it was going to be my opponent for Brazil in the  1974    World Cup &ndash;  Jarzinho. I was playing left-back and had only been    playing  there for  about two years, and I had seen this guy having a    great  World Cup four  years previously. We thought Brazil were going  to   give  us a doing, but  15 minutes into the game it was still 0-0.  So  we   started thinking that  these players aren&acute;t as good as we  thought  they   were. I think some of  them had enjoyed themselves in  the  four-year  gap  between the World Cups.  Jarzinho just wasn&rsquo;t up  for it.  We got  through  the game with a  goal-less draw so we were  delighted  and were  actually  disappointed not  to get a victory in the  end. But  the hardest  opponent  for me was Arthur  Graham of Aberdeen.  He worked  under Fergie  and he was  a good player.  Most people you  played  against, you could  give them a  wee kick or dunt  and they  would go  back up the pitch a  bit, which is  you wanted. The  further  away they  were from my goal, the  better I felt.  Arthur had this   great trick of  coming in just after  you cleared the  ball. It was an   art-form. His  timing was just great.  It wasn&rsquo;t too  early to do too  much  damage but  it was just fractionally  late. That  meant I was  thinking  about him  coming in late which would  take my mind  off the  ball. Just  that half  second and my intended pass  might go out  for a  throw-in or go  to one  of their players, so it  worked. Arthur was   quite pacey and he  played  in a good team so he was  always getting  good  service &ndash; but he  never  got by me that often! <br><br><b>Favourite game</b><br>I      played in some great European games but I have to say the St Mirren      game in 1986 when we won 5-0 to win the league. Everybody who  played in     that game played well. There wasn&rsquo;t one bad player. We  went into that     game, thinking Hearts just needed a point against a  struggling  Dundee    team and we thought they would beat them. So we  thought we  were just    there to play out the 90 minutes, and we  started the game  in that    mindset and played so well. We were 4-0 up  at half-time and  it was still    goal-less at Dens Park. We still  hadn&acute;t won the  championship and    thought Hearts would still score a  goal or two in  the second half. But    then the game restarts and  suddenly the crowd  starts to cheer. We  hadn&acute;t   scored a goal so  obviously something had  happened at Dundee.  Then we   scored a fifth  goal and then the crowd  started cheering again  and then   we knew we  were in with a chance. The  game was over in a  flash. Usually   in  games you are concentrated on  winning it but none of  us were even    thinking about that match. We  were all playing with a  great freedom as    if it was a bounce game.  Brian McClair got two so did  Maurice  Johnston   and Paul McStay got  one. Obviously people who hadn&acute;t  been  to the game   heard that Dundee  had scored so I think a lot of  people  came for the   celebration. The  ground was busy for a meaningless  game  as the Celtic   supporters came  to give us their backing, but the   crowd seemed to double   in size by  the end of the game! After the game   all the punters were on   the park  and I was thinking, &acute;where did all   these people come from!&acute; <br><br><b>Most disappointing game </b><br>There      are a few but one of them was losing to Real Madrid in the European     Cup  quarter-final in 1980. We beat them here 2-0 and lost 3-0 over     there.  That was just abysmal. To be part of that team before the  game    was  great, but it was just total embarrassment afterwards. They   weren&acute;t   a  great team back then and we shouldn&rsquo;t have lost three  goals  in  Spain  and  should have at least scored one.<br><br><b>Favourite away ground</b><br>I      liked Ibrox because it was just a nice big park. I enjoyed the  stick  I    got from the supporters. The more they booed you the better  the   player   you were. If you were a good player or just an ordinary  player,   they   would just shout and swear at you but I used to get  booed. I   knew they   didn&rsquo;t like me. Hampden was good and Aberdeen was  a good   park as well.   It was tight but it was always in good  condition.   Kilmarnock always had a   pristine pitch, too. <br><br><b>Least favourite ground</b><br>Brockville,      Falkirk&acute;s old home ground. It was just terrible. You would be  taking  a    throw-in and it felt like you were just a yard from the  crowd. It  was    such a tight ground. There was a big shed they had  with steel  railing    and if you were going at pace and hit these  railing you would  have  had   it. It was a defenders&acute; park. The  measurements of the pitch  must  have   been tiny. You just felt so  enclosed. Every space was  filled. It  was   also the ground where I had  my skull facture, though  that&acute;s not  the   reason why I didn&rsquo;t like  Brockville. It was just such a  tight  park. <br><br><b>Proudest moment</b><br>Being    given  the  captaincy when Kenny left in the summer of 1977, just  around   the  time  we went to Singapore and Australia for a tournament  against  Red   Star  Belgrade, Arsenal, a Singapore XI and an Australia  XI. You  can&acute;t   put  it into words what it meant. I went home that  night and  thought,   &acute;I&acute;m  the captain of Celtic&acute;. There isn&acute;t a phrase  that can  describe  it.  You  can say it was fantastic or brilliant,  but it was more  than  that.  You  were representing the club, fronting  the club. I was   captaining a   team that had won a European Cup and  was renowned around   the whole   world. I was hoping we could go on a  good roll, but in my   first year as   captain we won nothing!<br><br><b>Biggest regret</b><br>I      don&acute;t have any regrets. I could say that I could have gone to   England    and done this and that but as far as I know, no-one came for   me. I was    diagnosed as a diabetic in 1974 and I don&acute;t know if I  would  sign me    after that. I personally didn&rsquo;t know how long I would  be  able to play    for. No-one actually told me that I could play on   without a problem but    diabetes has never affected me once. I was   diagnosed in 1974 and  played   on until 1987 so I played for another 13   years without any  problems. I   remember Alex Ferguson phoned me to   ask if he should sign  Gary Mabbut,   as he was diabetic. He crossed   every T and did everything  by the book.   Gary was great and played for   a long time after that but  Alex Ferguson   didn&rsquo;t sign him. Maybe he   never listened to my advice  and just didn&rsquo;t   want to gamble with the   money or maybe he just found a  better player. <br><br><b>Greatest goal scored</b><br>I      didn&rsquo;t score good goals! I remember scoring against Gordon   Marshall&acute;s    dad at Arbroath. I got to the touchline and was off   balance when I was    cutting the ball back. He anticipated me cutting   it back and it went   too  early and the ball went inside him and into   the net. Everyone   laughed  as it was such a stupid goal! I also scored   against Jim   McArthur for  Hibs. It went through a ruck of players  and  the ball   didn&rsquo;t seem to be  going at a fast pace but it ended up   going into the   back of the net. My  favourite goal was one I scored  at  Motherwell. I   should have scored  three that day but I think I  gave  Vic Davidson one   or two of them by  cutting the ball back. I had  three  chances but gave   two away. If anyone  can remember me scoring a  goal,  please write in and   let me know about  it! <br><br><b>Greatest goal witnessed</b><br>Joe     Jordan&acute;s  goal for Scotland against Czechoslovakia in 1973. It  wasn&rsquo;t  a   great goal  but it meant that we had qualified for the World  Cup  for   the first time  in about 15 years. You see people having  great  strikes   and winning  goals but Joe Jordan will always be  remembered  for that   goal. <br><br><b>Tell us something we don&acute;t know about your career</b><br>I      am proud of showing that having diabetes shouldn&rsquo;t stop you having   an    active life. A lot more people seem to be getting diabetes now,    whether   it be type one (where you inject) or type two (where you    don&acute;t). For   anyone who has type one and wants to be a good athlete,    golfer or rock   climber etc &ndash; it&acute;s not going to stop you. I played with    it for 13 years   and never had a problem. It&rsquo;s all about how you  look   after yourself and   live your life. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Quotes And Tributes <img align="right" alt="McGrain  78" height="359" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/wiki/McGrain++78/image/1FrekWS2Qe$yTuFLpvC8rTA==57769/GW277H359" title="McGrain  78" width="277"></h3><b>Early Celtic Memories</b>   <br>McGrain    cannot recall his precise Celtic debut, but he remembers an early   first  team experience in August 1970 when he replaced Harry Hood in a   League  Cup tie against Dundee United at Tannadice.<br><br>He revealed:   &quot;I came  on for Harry at half-time and Bobby Murdoch played a pass to   give me an  early touch to calm any nerves. But I allowed the ball to   run under my  foot and it went out for a throw-in.<br><br>&quot;But,   thankfully, Bobby  didn&#39;t give me a hard time. He could see I was   nervous and told me it  was OK. His encouragement boosted my   confidence.&quot;<br><br>In July 1967,  when, together with Kenny Dalglish,   his great friend, he dared to ask  Stein if they could go full-time at   the club. The pair were miserable as  respectively a trainee mechanical   engineer and an apprentice joiner.  &quot;Football was the easy option.  Kenny  and I thought the real world was  too hard.&quot;<br><br>McGrain and  Kenny  Dalglish, two of the most  outstanding members of Celtic&#39;s  &quot;Quality  Street&quot; gang, had accompanied  the squad to Milan for the  European Cup  final against Feyenoord as kit  boys. <br><br><b>Danny on The Manager</b><br>&quot;Mr Stein was an imposing figure. I was in awe when I first met Mr Stein, and I thought I was all through my playing career.<br><br>&quot;He meant something to every player. Whether or not they liked him as a person he was loved for what he did for their careers.<br><br>&quot;How    big an influence was he? How long is a piece of string? He was a nice    man. A nice, nice man. You don&#39;t remember the things your dad did to   you  that were bad. You remember the nice things like Christmas or your    birthday. Maybe Mr Stein could give you stick, but it was forgotten    outside the dressing room. He taught me so much. He hurried things up    for me.&quot;<br><br>McGrain had been signed from Queen&#39;s Park Strollers on the recommendation of Jock Stein&#39;s assistant, Sean Fallon.<br><br>&quot;But it was Sean who wanted to sign me and Kenny and I owe him a lot. To this day whenever I meet Sean I want to thank him.&quot;<br><br><b>Commenting on the 4-2 game</b><br>&quot;At    the start of the season it looked as if I didn&#39;t have a football    future. I suffered an ankle injury which kept me out of the World Cup    and I was told I wouldn&#39;t play again. Now I was the skipper of the title    winners; it was some turn-around.&quot;<br><br><b>Best Moment With Celtic</b><br>It&#39;s    difficult to pick one moment from all that time, but beating St  Mirren   5-0 at Love Street to win the championship in 1986 was a great  moment.<br><br><b>Worst</b><br>When Mr Stein left, he was missed around the club and there was a void left by his absence.<br><br><b>Favourite Away Ground</b><br>I    loved the whole atmosphere and the love/hate thing at Ibrox. There  was   more blood and thunder in those days, but that was more acceptable   then.<br><br><b>Favourite Goal Scored</b><br>Mine  were quite   forgettable. My biggest was probably against Partick Thistle  in the   Glasgow Cup, when I scored the winner to take us to the final!<br><br>&quot;My bottle just went in the box. I just couldn&#39;t score.&quot;<br><br><b>Discipline</b><br>McGrain,    despite the ferocity of his talking, was not a dirty player. He    received only one red card in his career of 650 games for Celtic and 62    for Scotland. It came against Aberdeen at Celtic Park on October 9,    1982, for two fouls on Peter Weir. The second was worthy of a yellow    card, the first was not. &quot;I was late for the second one, unfortunately I    only realised that when I was in mid-air. It&#39;s always like that when    you are late.&quot; <br><br><b>Tackling is a &quot;lost art&quot;</b> <br>&quot;You can&#39;t    tackle now and I do see more young guys copying professional players  by   feigning injury. We used to laugh at the Italians for doing it, now  we   copy them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;My tackling was good because my timing was  good.   Okay, not every tackle was inch-perfect, but I never went in to  hurt   anybody.&quot; <br><br><b>Injuries and Illness</b> <br>He sustained a    fractured skull after a clash with Doug Somner at Brockville on March    25, 1972, and then there was the discovery that he suffered from    diabetes after the 1974 World Cup.<br><br>&quot;The fracture wasn&#39;t that    severe,&quot; says McGrain, touching his forehead. &quot;Wee Louie (Macari) didn&#39;t    want to go on because it was a cold day at Brockville, but I said I    felt okay and then I collapsed as I tried to leave the dressing room. I    woke up in an ambulance on my way to hospital.&quot;<br><br>After an  anxious   three months when double vision persisted, McGrain&#39;s  rehabilitation   started sitting at home heading a balloon and was  completed when Bertie   Miller, of Aberdeen, blootered him with ball at  the beginning of the   1972-73 season.<br><br>It was the searing heat of  Frankfurt, Scotland&#39;s   base at the 1974 World Cup, that made McGrain  realise he was again   seriously ill. He lost two stones in weight  during the tournament and   his nights were spent on a depressing cycle  of drinking pints of orange   juice and then going to the toilet. On his  return, his wife, Laraine,   insisted that he visited the doctor and he  was diagnosed diabetic. If   Scotland had progressed, as they came  agonisingly close to doing, he   could have suffered a diabetic coma.<br><br>Later  injuries, such as a   broken leg and the mysterious ankle injury which  he sustained when he   and John Blackley clattered into each other at  Celtic Park in 1977.<br><br>The   ankle problem, finally cured by  acupuncture, meant McGrain missed   Argentina, but he played against New  Zealand and the USSR in Spain four   years later.<br><br><b>Danny Versus . . .</b><br>Jairzinho,  who had   scored in every game of the 1970 finals and tormented  Giacinto   Facchetti, the legendary Italian left-back, in Brazil&#39;s 4-1  final   victory, hardly got a kick when he faced McGrain in Scotland&#39;s  0-0 draw   with the world champions.<br><br>Jairzinho, he insists,  &quot;wasn&#39;t the  same  player&quot; he had gaped at on television four years  previously and  was  hardly as troublesome as Arthur Graham, of  Aberdeen. &quot;You would be   allowed one hard tackle at the start of the  game, but Arthur could take   it and when you had the ball he would  tackle you. Davie Cooper was  tough  to pin down, but if you tackled him  hard he would drift back  deeper  where he was less dangerous. Arthur  just kept coming.&quot;<br><br><b>Teammates on Danny</b><br>Billy McNeill, &quot;a real cruel tackler at times&quot;. <br><br>Tommy    Burns still winces at the memory of their Celtic training sessions    together. &quot;He came through you like a ton of bricks. There was never any    going through the motions for Danny. He was consistently phenomenal,    the greatest player I played with.&quot;<br><br>Jim Craig: after I got    married, I picked up Danny at Canniesburn Toll. Evan Williams, our    goalkeeper, used to live out that way too and he would give Danny lifts    as well. One day we decided to play a trick on him. Evan drove past    Danny and said: &#39;Don&#39;t worry, Jim will be along in a minute&#39;. Then I    drove past and shouted: &#39;Evan will pick you up today, Danny&#39;. We watched    from behind some bushes as he looked around frantically for a taxi.&quot;<br><br><b>Jim McLean on Danny</b><br>Stein    had just told McGrain, who had captained the Scots to a 5-2 win in  the   opening game against New Zealand, he was being dropped.<br><br>Liverpool    skipper Graeme Souness was handed the armband at the expense of his    vastly-experienced colleague, then 32 and a veteran of the 1974 World    Cup.<br><br>Ultimately McGrain would win the last of his 62 caps in the    final game against the USSR in Malaga, a 2-2 draw, but it was not    unreasonable to believe he feared he&#39;d already played his last game when    Stein read out the team.<br><br>McLean said: &quot;A lot of players at    international level do have big egos but Danny&#39;s reaction that day was    the act of a true professional.<br><br>&quot;He must have been shattered when Jock announced the starting 11 in a team meeting a few hours before the game.<br><br>&quot;But    as soon as Jock finished listing the team and addressing the squad    Danny was the first player on his feet to roar encouragement to the    others.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;d never seen that side of Danny. He was not an    out-and-out motivator because he preferred to set his examples quietly    and was enormously respected by the rest of the players as a result.<br><br>&quot;Football    is a team game but we&#39;re still all selfish at times and in that    situation every player was sitting nervously, hoping he&#39;d be picked.<br><br>&quot;Danny was a fixture in the side and must have been so disappointed not to be listed.<br><br>&quot;But his first thought was for the team and I will never forget his reaction.<br><br><b>Ally Dawson on Danny</b><br>The    one [game v Celtic] that stands out for me was the second game I   played  after I returned from a fractured skull. I made my comeback in   an  Anglo-Scottish Cup tie against Chesterfield and then it was straight    into a match against Celtic. We won that game 1-0 at Ibrox.<br><br>But    what sticks out in my mind was that after that match Danny McGrain   made a  point of coming up to me to ask how I was. He had suffered a   fractured  skull himself and wished me all the best with my recovery.   That speaks  volumes. <br><br><b>Hugh McIlvanney on Danny</b> <br>&quot;When   great  racehorse trainers talk about the best thoroughbreds, they   emphasise not  only talent but attitude. In addition to the obvious   qualities of pace  and skill that Danny brought to football, there was   the priceless asset  of his approach to the game. He encountered all   kinds of problems  through injury and difficulties with his health, but   nothing could  prevent him from being prodigious on the field.<br><br>&quot;Anybody   who saw  him at his best had the unmistakeable impression of watching a   great  player, probably one who had no superior anywhere in the  world.&quot;<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><img align="bottom" alt="Board, Management & Player Changes. - The Celtic Wiki" height="1270" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c032de478c3d8ac3007f605c9eb9f147/GW1024H1270" title="Board, Management & Player Changes. - The Celtic Wiki" width="1024"></h3><br><h3>Interview: Danny McGrain still going strong at 62</h3><h3 class="article-content__lead">WAITING in reception for Danny McGrain, I&rsquo;m enjoying the view of the Campsies as they rise out of the mist.</h3>                  Aidan Smith<br><br>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/premiership/interview-danny-mcgrain-still-going-strong-at-62-1-2782594<br><br>It&rsquo;s a stunning backdrop and you can&rsquo;t help wondering  how many Celtic-minded bods have fantasised about the phizogs of Hoops  notables being carved out of the hills, Mount Rushmore-style. Kenny  Dalglish, Henrik Larsson, Wayne Biggins? It&rsquo;s a good parlour-game,  deciding who should be immortalised in rock, and surely today&rsquo;s subject  would be a top contender.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>International week means the Lennoxtown training  complex is quiet, although a lycra-clad expert in stretching is  attending to Fraser Forster&rsquo;s troublesome neck. This is the kind of  specialist care which simply wasn&rsquo;t available to the likes of McGrain.  Forty-one years ago at Brockville, he banged heads with Falkirk&rsquo;s Doug  Somner and, on coming round, was greeted with a swish of the &ldquo;magic  sponge&rdquo; and a reluctant substitute. McGrain played on with what was  later diagnosed as a fractured skull.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>With or without characterful dents, his face would  be a stone-carver&rsquo;s delight, just as it appealed to the painter Humphrey  Ocean who crafted his likeness for the Scottish National Portrait  Gallery a few years back. The beard is grey now, giving him a craggy,  seafaring aspect, and his specs are kept close on a piece of cord. But  there&rsquo;s also a glint of gold round his neck, while a fat ring bears the  initials &ldquo;DM&rdquo;. He may have always looked older than Dalglish and the  rest of the Quality Street Gang, but he was still a footballer from  Glasgow. That requires a degree of gallusness which you simply don&rsquo;t see  anywhere else, at least not in men of 62.<div class="p402_hide">           </div>Now it&rsquo;s possible you do not regard McGrain, these days part of  Neil Lennon&rsquo;s coaching staff, as one of oor fitba&rsquo;s towering  intellectuals, wherever they may be. If so, there&rsquo;s a good chance your  reasoning, itself wholly non-intellectual, is largely based on that dunt  on the head. Well, regarding the incident, consider this afterthought:  &ldquo;Brockville was always a defender&rsquo;s park. It suited me but not guys like  wee Louie [Lou Macari, the 12th man who stayed put] because it was just  too tight for attackers.&rdquo; An obvious point? Ah, that must be why I&rsquo;ve  never heard anyone make it before... <br>McGrain questions accepted  wisdom. He says things like: &ldquo;Before the term &lsquo;world-class&rsquo; became such a  clich&eacute; &hellip; &rdquo; (and this a full 24 hours before England captain Steven  Gerrard called for the phrase to be banned in relation to Jack Wilshire,  for the player&rsquo;s benefit). He self-edits (&ldquo;No, not like a shark  smelling blood, like a lion that hadn&rsquo;t eaten for days&hellip;&rdquo;). And rather  than quote from his own highly romantic backstory for the umpteenth  time, he throws me by casting doubt on its veracity. Did a Rangers scout  really decide not to pursue interest after discovering his full name  was Daniel Fergus McGrain? &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the legend, but I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; sure. In  fact, I wonder if it wasn&rsquo;t started by some wee Glasgow guy. I must have  been 16, playing for Queen&rsquo;s Park Strollers. If the scout was doing his  job properly then he could have easily found out I was a pupil at  Kingsridge Secondary in Drumchapel &ndash; a Protestant school. That&rsquo;s if the  scout even existed... &rdquo;<br>Fraser Forster is trying to get fit for  Juventus and Champions League knockout on Tuesday. Back in September  1981, according to reports, McGrain &ldquo;rose from his sick bed&rdquo; to captain  Celtic against Juve in the first round of the European Cup. He laughs.  &ldquo;Did I have a cold maybe? That must have been all it was because I  wouldn&rsquo;t have wanted to miss a great European night at Celtic Park.  Juventus wore blue, I remember. An exquisite team, [Roberto] Bettega and  all those guys.&rdquo; (And Dino Zoff, Marco Tardelli, Claudio Gentile,  Antonio Cabrini and Gaetano Scirea who would help Italy lift the World  Cup the following summer).<br>Famously, the Lisbon Lions were  gobsmacked by Inter Milan&rsquo;s matinee-idol handsomeness and their  colognes. Were the Juve of &rsquo;81 similarly fragrant? Another chuckle. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure they were, but I think the personal hygiene of us Glasgow boys had  come on a bit since &rsquo;67 so we wouldn&rsquo;t have noticed and probably we  thought we were smelling quite nice ourselves!&rdquo; He remembers the slow  tempo the Old Lady tried to impose on the game, and some diving. &ldquo;In  Scotland at that time if you kicked somebody they&rsquo;d swear a bit &ndash;  actually, a lot &ndash; but no one went down like they&rsquo;d been shot. Now they  all do. But I hate to sound like an old footballer moaning &hellip; &rdquo;<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>A Murdo MacLeod goal gave Celtic the narrowest of  leads but before the return McGrain broke a leg in a clash with Partick  Thistle&rsquo;s Kenny Watson &ndash; &ldquo;a big hulk of a guy with all this hair but a  total accident.&rdquo; In Turin a young fellow called David Moyes deputised  while he watched from the stands. &ldquo;The Juve fans threw fruit at our guys  as they walked up the tunnel, or maybe it was tatties.&rdquo; That man  Bettega won it for the Italians, 2-1 on aggregate. <br>This gets  McGrain thinking about other Italian jobs, including a Celtic youths  tour at a highly impressionable 17. Was that his first time abroad?  &ldquo;Naw, I&rsquo;d been to Butlins at Margate! But that was an incredible trip  for a boy to make and, yes, just the smell of Italy was exciting. And,  boys being boys, Italian girls were very exciting.&rdquo; Then there was Milan  and Celtic&rsquo;s second European Cup final in three years under Jock Stein  whom  McGrain still refers to as &ldquo;Mr&rdquo;.<br>&ldquo;Kenny Dalglish and I were  picked as the boot boys, an enormous privilege. I couldn&rsquo;t get over how  relaxed the build-up was. The final of the European Cup and there was Mr  Stein officiating games of headers on the hotel tennis-courts. I sat  them out, probably because I wasn&rsquo;t good enough, but Kenny played  alongside Big Billy [McNeill], John Clark, Yogi [John Hughes], Bobby  Murdoch. And Jimmy Johnstone and Bobby Lennox &ndash; two funny guys. Funny  sitting down together &ndash; I&rsquo;m picturing them right now &ndash; and funny walking  about. They were just two cheeky imps who were aye thinking: &lsquo;How can  we have a laugh here?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br>Did the young McGrain dream about some  Jinky-Lennox malarkey inadvertently injuring the regular full-backs,   propelling him into the starting line-up? He scoffs. &ldquo;I must be one of  few players who doesn&rsquo;t dream. They all do now, don&rsquo;t they? &lsquo;I dreamt I  was going to score the last-minute goal that won us the cup,&rsquo; they say.  Just tosh. I don&rsquo;t believe you can dream about something that hasn&rsquo;t yet  happened.&rdquo;<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>This sounds like the same McGrain who used to be so  uncomfortable wearing the epithet of &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s best right-back&rdquo;. He  still thinks such proclamations are daft, with huge potential for  embarrassment. &ldquo;I know they&rsquo;re compliments and well-meant, but they were  made when we didn&rsquo;t see much football from other countries on TV and  now that we do, folk are still at it. Then you go to a big tournament  and realise there&rsquo;s a heck of a lot of football played in the world. Who  was talking about Feyenoord before they beat Celtic [in &rsquo;70]? Then  quickly after them came Ajax, the whole Dutch  revolution.&rdquo;<br>Nevertheless, McGrain was pretty good, wasn&rsquo;t he? Amassing 663  appearances, he was part of Celtic&rsquo;s nine-in-a-row, the team that won  the league with ten men (this is where his hungry lion comes in), the  team that caught Hearts at the last-gasp. Seven championships, five  Scottish Cups. All of that despite the fractured skull, the broken leg, a  mystery, year-long ankle injury &ndash; and the diabetes. &ldquo;At the 1974 World  Cup, half-time in the first game against Zaire and right through Willie  Ormond&rsquo;s team-talk, I was lying underneath a tap used for washing boots &ndash;  I couldn&rsquo;t get enough fluid in me.&rdquo; The condition was only diagnosed on  his return from Germany having shed two stones. Against Brazil, he  would still saunter across to the left-back berth and shackle Jairzinho.  &ldquo;Ach, he wasn&rsquo;t the player he&rsquo;d been in Mexico,&rdquo; says our man of the  night Scotland annihilated the world champs 0-0. &ldquo;Jarzinho had won the  World Cup and been feted for it. Over those four years he&rsquo;d enjoyed  himself maybe a bit too much. Rivelino was the same and, to be honest,  Brazil disappointed me. Even though we benefited, I felt let down.&rdquo;<br>Yet  more evidence of the thoughtful football man. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t even want to be  a footballer,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;I wanted to be a mechanical engineer but  couldn&rsquo;t understand Higher Maths. I watched the &rsquo;66 World Cup on TV, and  fabulous Brazil in &rsquo;70, and never dreamed I&rsquo;d be playing in the next  one. Well, you know I dinnae dream of such things. Before my Celtic  debut [&rsquo;72, the old League Cup groups, sub for Harry Hood] I&rsquo;d been  going: &lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t let anyone get injured.&rsquo; Mr Stein almost had to  push me on with a fork handle. Then at the final whistle I was like:  &lsquo;Brilliant, I want more.&rsquo;<br>McGrain won a lot, where does he keep  the medals? &ldquo;They&rsquo;re up in the loft, mouldering away. I don&rsquo;t need them  on display. The kids know who I am.&rdquo; He and his wife Laraine have three  daughters and one of their grand-daughters, four-year-old Dawn, has  posted them a photo from Hong Kong for every day she&rsquo;s been alive. A few  images from his career adorn the walls: one with Stein and another  leading out Scotland at Wembley in &rsquo;81, a game won with a penalty by  John Robertson (&ldquo;Brian Clough ripped into him for his slovenliness but  with a ball at his feet he was wonderful&rdquo;). A third is of McGrain and  Dalglish, fast friends from the off.<br>&ldquo;You find your pals through  likes or dislikes which in Scottish football can often mean: does he  drink? Neither of us did, although in Kenny&rsquo;s case that was down to him  being too bloody miserable to buy any!&rdquo; He remembers the day they were  the only ones to be spared a half-time blast from Big Jock despite the  Celts being two-up against Hearts and how much that unnerved them. The  upbraiding would follow later, in private, from Billy McNeill and Jimmy  Johnstone. &ldquo;Mr Stein&rsquo;s psychology was it would have more impact coming  from guys we were in awe of. Apparently, he thought we had a bit too  much swagger about us. I can just imagine Jinky taking his orders:  &lsquo;Yeah, Gaffer, swagger &ndash; we&rsquo;ll deal with it.&rsquo; Did we? I&rsquo;m not sure,  although I never doubted Mr Stein. We went on to win that game 4-0, by  the way &ndash; quite a swaggering performance!&rdquo;<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>McGrain reckons his big thing was consistency,  nearly always the same level of performance. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember many bad  games, nor many outstanding games,&rdquo; he says, though many would take  issue with him on the latter. He&rsquo;s been consistently entertaining and  insightful for a full 90 minutes today. On what our great game might  have lost, he says: &ldquo;Supporters&rsquo; club functions. Not for the prizes &ndash;  silverware, some crystal or for Frank McGarvey once, a vacuum-cleaner &ndash;  but so that fans could meet the players. Mr Stein sent us out to them  all the time but they don&rsquo;t seem to happen so much now. Maybe the  associations think what they could afford to give the modern footballer  is too paltry.&rdquo;<br>He&rsquo;s been happy to talk up the immortals some more  (&ldquo;In &rsquo;74 we wanted to do well for Billy Bremner and Denis Law who would  never get to another World Cup&rdquo;) but also careful not to forget other  notables, less quoted. &ldquo;John Brownlie was probably a better right-back  than me but he suffered such a bad leg-break.&rdquo; Then there was Brownlie&rsquo;s  Hibs team-mate Erich Schaedler. &ldquo;What a superb physical specimen. In  Germany, because of IRA death-threats against Sandy Jardine, we had  security with us at all times. Erich was aye asking them how they  neutralised a guy but they wouldn&rsquo;t say. He was convinced they had a  technique like Mr Spock&rsquo;s in Star Trek &ndash; you know, just a slight squeeze  of the shoulders &ndash; and would try it out on the rest of the boys. But  Erich &ndash; hard, hard man &ndash; couldn&rsquo;t do slight squeezes!&rdquo;<br>Among the  Quality Street Gang, George Connelly was the great enigma. &ldquo;He was from  Kincardine, loved the place and you couldn&rsquo;t take it out of him. As much  as I&rsquo;m from Drumchapel I think I&rsquo;ve grown through football and learned  how to communicate with people. The poor lad just couldn&rsquo;t handle being  recognised but he was a rare talent.&rdquo; Now we&rsquo;re circumnavigating Planet  Football with this would-be sailor &ndash; to Real Madrid (&ldquo;Another debacle&rdquo;)  and Atletico Madrid (&ldquo;Veins sticking out of necks with hatred &ndash; but I  always loved games where the fans booed you&rdquo;). To Ujpest Dozsa  (&ldquo;Godawful strips, just lilac T-shirts&rdquo;) and Partizan Tirana (&ldquo;There was  a rumour I&rsquo;d be banned from entering Albania because of my beard; I  wish I had been. Every meal-time the same consomme with a raw egg on  top, guys holding hands in the street. To us from the west of Scotland  that wasn&rsquo;t right&rdquo;).<br>We&rsquo;ve come full circle and are back in Turin.  &ldquo;That was when I discovered champagne! We were in Italy&rsquo;s region for  it, so we were told, so with me not playing and my leg in plaster I  thought it would be impolite not to try some at lunchtime and downright  rude not to have a bit more with my dinner. Although as you know I  dinnae drink!&rdquo;<br><br><h3>Danny McGrain: If Neil Lennon wins 10-in-a-row I hope he gets the knighthood that Jock Stein should have got</h3>https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/danny-mcgrain-neil-lennon-wins-1842862<br><br>  NEIL LENNON hadn&rsquo;t been born when Danny McGrain was part of his first title-winning Celtic side.<br><br>And there was no such club as Inverness Caley Thistle when McGrain began the glittering career that saw him make 657 appearances for his club.<br><br>But tomorrow the man Lennon appointed as first-team coach will stand beside the manager in the dugout as Celtic aim to celebrate their second title in succession by beating the Highland side.<br><br>The moment will give Danny, two weeks short of his 63rd birthday, pause for reflection on the passage of time.<br><br>But he&rsquo;s not one of those who believes that in his day players were better and so was the standard of Scottish football.<br><br>He believes in fresh horizons.<br><br>The side he was part of claimed the original nine in a row but McGrain believes the team he works with now could be laying the foundations for a history-making 10 successive titles.<br><br>McGrain made his name in a side that contained Jimmy Johnstone and also forced him into direct competition with the late Davie Cooper at Rangers.<br><br>But arguably the finest full-back of his generation claims the player he would have hated to face most is James Forrest.<br><br>McGrain says he doesn&rsquo;t do memory lane because he can&rsquo;t remember anything about a playing career that began with his debut at Tannadice in 1970.<br><br>But over the course of a conversation at Lennoxtown yesterday he proved he can instantly recall more than he lets on.<br><br>And the Celtic legend holds firm opinions on the present day, particularly where Lennon is concerned.<br><br>In fact, McGrain would go so far as to say it&rsquo;s the arrival of Lennon in the manager&rsquo;s office that most provides him with the inspiration to prolong a time at Celtic that will forever see him enshrined as one of the club&rsquo;s greats.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s working with Lenny and good players that makes you want to get up and come to your work every day.<br><br>&ldquo;You could hardly call it a hardship to work beside someone who talks about the game incessantly and observe the way he treats players.<br><br>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much in the way of TLC. It&rsquo;s more a case of handling players the way they need to be treated and that can range from being a disciplinarian to speaking to them as a father would to a son.&rdquo;<br><br>McGrain is Lennon&rsquo;s link to the greatest Celtic manager of them all, Jock Stein.<br><br>It was Stein who had handed him a debut in a world far removed from the environment he works in today.<br><br>&ldquo;I had no ambition to be a pro footballer,&rdquo; said McGrain. &ldquo;I would have ended up as a mechanical engineer if I&rsquo;d been able to get my head around Higher maths.<br><br>&ldquo;Mr Stein didn&rsquo;t even ask me at first to go full-time. He told me to stick to the day job and kept Kenny Dalglish as an apprentice joiner.<br><br>&ldquo;The kids I see coming into the academy here want to be footballers or pop stars because they&rsquo;re part of a TV generation who see that as a glamorous way to make your name.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d have been good enough for our academy.<br><br>&ldquo;These kids can pass the ball for a start, which I&rsquo;d never have done when we were playing games of 20-a-side during my childhood in Drumchapel. I thought real players were posh and came from Bearsden.&rdquo;<br><br>Everyone knows the story. Rangers are supposed to have looked at this fledgling talent called Daniel Fergus McGrain and, in those less enlightened times, looked away again because of his name.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if that story&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; McGrain said. &ldquo;Over the years that followed nobody from Rangers ever told me they wanted to sign me.<br><br>&ldquo;I never thought I&rsquo;d see the day when Rangers weren&rsquo;t in the same league and it will add a bit to our game when they come back to the SPL.<br><br>&ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t happen right away, even for Scottish football&rsquo;s sake, because they have to pay their dues for what went on.<br><br>&ldquo;However, I thought it was great when I ran towards the Rangers end and got dog&rsquo;s abuse during the derbies.<br><br>&ldquo;I never thought they booed because I was the Protestant who played for the other side. I thought they booed me because I was a good player.&rdquo;<br><br>Now McGrain knows you don&rsquo;t need to be posh to push forward in the game &ndash; and he singles out Forrest as someone who could have dominated defences in any decade.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have found James a nightmare. He looks about 12 but would have been murder to play against because of that ability to go by people.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never get a minute&rsquo;s peace because, no sooner had the ball gone out of play than a new one would be thrown on. That didn&rsquo;t happen in my day.<br><br>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t think James could have taken what Jinky had to take on the park. He was up and down like a rubber ball because he wouldn&rsquo;t cheat and roll about on the ground.<br><br>&ldquo;Good players like wee Jimmy, James and Henrik Larsson don&rsquo;t need to do that.<br><br>&ldquo;Mr Stein would have told me to make sure I won my first tackle. He didn&rsquo;t mean for me to go through my opponent but let&rsquo;s just say the winger would have known what to expect.<br><br>&ldquo;One of the reasons I still derive as much enjoyment from the game is because of players like James.<br><br>&ldquo;People who don&rsquo;t even support Celtic will admire him for his skill as much as they did with Aiden McGeady.&rdquo;<br><br>Mr Stein. McGrain never referred to him as &ldquo;Big Jock&rdquo; or &ldquo;the gaffer&rdquo; at any stage and never would.<br><br>The man who won Celtic the European Cup in the same year that McGrain signed for the club is easily described as an iconic figure. And, as much as McGrain has the highest regard for Lennon, he can&rsquo;t rewrite history for his benefit.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;There will never be a greater manager than Mr Stein. But if Neil wins 10 in a row for Celtic I hope he gets the knighthood Mr Stein never got for his accomplishments.<br><br>&ldquo;It was a shameful omission on someone&rsquo;s part.<br><br>&ldquo;Neil can only get better. He must have learned from the Champions League run.<br><br>&ldquo;Nobody in football ever uses the word perfection because none of us believes that can ever be achieved in the game.<br><br>&ldquo;But for as long as Lenny is manager, the team can only go from strength to strength.<br><br>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t we win 10 in a row? Eight years is a long time and the same players won&rsquo;t be at the club in 2021 but I&rsquo;ve admired the manager&rsquo;s work since we both handled Celtic&rsquo;s development team.<br><br>&ldquo;A year later he was boss and became the demonstrative guy you see now in the dugout.<br><br>&ldquo;Mr Stein didn&rsquo;t conduct himself like that but the stakes are higher now.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s second title under Lennon will be dismissed by rival supporters who say it&rsquo;s an irrelevance while Rangers are missing from the SPL. But McGrain said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember one easy game this season.<br><br>&ldquo;I look at the league from a different perspective. I see the hard work that Lenny puts in to make this side attractive.<br><br>&ldquo;And the message he&rsquo;ll deliver just before the game is: &lsquo;The supporters love you &ndash; pay them back.&rsquo;<br><br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe Lenny wasn&rsquo;t born when I was winning titles. Mind you, I was 12 when it happened for the first time.<br><br>&ldquo;The monkey glands have kept me going since then.&rdquo;  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div><h3>  How Brendan Rodgers Embarrassed a Celtic Legend &ndash; The Truth</h3><a href="/page/McGrain%2C+Danny+-+Misc+Articles" target="_self">https://celtsarehere.com/how-brendan-rodgers-embarrassed-a-celtic-legend-the-truth/</a><br>By<br>CeltsAreHere -<br>March 4, 2019<br>There has been a lot flying around about Brendan Rodgers since his departure. Working through the muck in social media of people up to mischief and people just blatantly making things up &ndash; it&rsquo;s hard to find what&rsquo;s true.<br><br>Whether people want to admit it or not, when the news broke that Brendan Rodgers had left Celtic with immediate effect it sent a massive shockwave through the club and its support! Why? Because we had listened to a man for two-and-a-half-years who brought us a lot of success but not just that he sold us on the idea he was Celtic through and through; something I still maintain to this day he never had to do. Pandering to the support to get them on side is for someone who doesn&rsquo;t deliver trophy after trophy. The man had 13,000 people turn up to see him being unveiled as Celtic boss before he had even said a word, but when he finally spoke he told us about the Celtic way, growing up a Celtic fan and evoked memories of the late great Tommy Burns; we were already sold but this was the icing on the cake.<br><br>Since then we&rsquo;ve had quotes like &lsquo;I was born into Celtic&rsquo;, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in my dream job&rsquo; etc.<br><br>This is why the fall was so great when the news filtered through the manager was off, and not to a top four or even six side, but to Leicester Football Club. The way Rodgers spoke about Celtic made the supporters feel we had a real gem of a manager and one of our own was leading us towards great things.<br><br>In reality &ndash; we had a great football manager, a magnificent mind and someone who can work really well with young talent &ndash; what we didn&rsquo;t have was a Celtic man, we had someone masquerading as a Celtic fan, and that&rsquo;s why we all feel so foolish. We fell for it; I fell for it!<br><br>The most significant instance I&rsquo;ve come across so far with Rodgers manipulation of the Celtic support which has proven to be completely false (I&rsquo;m sure there will be other instances that come up in the future) is the Irishman&rsquo;s story about Celtic legend Danny McGrain which had us all applauding at the time.<br><br>If you are on social media you may already know this story and you might have been one of the 1300 people in attendance when this particular Rodgers fib was debunked, but it&rsquo;s worth watching it again before hearing the truth behind the lie.<br><br>Brendan Rodgers did an evening with Eamon Holmes to promote his new book which was coming out, during the Q&amp;A the Irishman told the Celtic supporters stories of things he&rsquo;s experienced since he came in. The story which captured the most imagination at the time and was widely shared on many different platforms.<br><br>Here is that video.<br>Video Player<br><br>Media error: Format(s) not supported or source(s) not foundmejs.download-file: https://video.twimg.com/ext_tw_video/926154366771482624/pu/vid/1280x720/lymuO8z31iKdTQp_.mp4?_=1<br>00:00<br>00:00<br><br>Danny McGrain was in attendance on the night and even was prompted to stand up and take applause after the story.<br><br>It would transpire in January that this whole story was nothing more than a fictional tale by the former Celtic manager although even Danny himself passed it off as &lsquo;ach, he&rsquo;s trying to sell books&rsquo;. However, the Celtic Legend admitted he was embarrassed by the story as to him it appeared as if he was desperate for a job.<br><br>McGrain debunked the story at an ACSOM event (A Celtic State of Mind) when the story came up during a Q&amp;A. The host on the night Mr Paul John Dykes confirmed Danny&rsquo;s story on the latest episode of the ACSOM, how it came about and why he didn&rsquo;t want to stir the pot while Brendan Rodgers was still the Celtic manager and put Danny in an awkward position.<br>Speaking on the ACSOM podcast, Paul John Dykes said: &ldquo;As an opener, I asked the question about Brendan Rodgers well-told story about their first experience together on the first training session, that Brendan told at his book launch.<br>&ldquo;He told the story to Eamon Holmes and it ended up on a Celtic DVD<br>&ldquo;It was a beautiful sound bite and Danny McGrain basically said, it didn&rsquo;t happen&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;Apparently it cropped up on a Celtic forum and somebody sent me a screenshot of the quote that the user had actually put up. Now I would be paraphrasing, but that screenshot is EXACTLY how I remember the conversation; it&rsquo;s about as near as verbatim as it possibly could be&rdquo;<br><br>&ldquo;What Danny said that night was that he was embarrassed. He was sitting at the crowd at the Glasgow Hydro, sitting there with his wife and it made him embarrassed because it made him appear like he was desperate for a job.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;The reason I&rsquo;ve not mentioned it because Danny McGrain and Brendan Rodgers are both employed by Celtic at that point and it will look as though I&rsquo;m trying to throw a spanner in the works.&rdquo;<br>&ldquo;It would look as though I&rsquo;m criticising the gaffer, and if I done that in January it would appear as though I was up to no good, creating an issue that wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;<br><br>A warm story, well received and designed to put across his &lsquo;Celtic Minded&rsquo; gimmick. When you hear that story, you might think it&rsquo;s trivial and not worth our attention, but this is just one comment which has been found out not to be true.<br><br>How many more stories have been spun and comments embellished to create the perception Brendan made for himself, a perception that would have been his legacy if he had stayed just another three months?<br><br>The bottom line is, he took us all for a ride and as we put him in the rearview mirror and the dust on his Celtic legacy settles &ndash; we must remember he was a hugely successful manager for the club who knowingly used us to repair his managerial image and cut and run when it suited him.<br><br>A great manager yes, a Celtic man, never.  </div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div></div><br></div></div>
