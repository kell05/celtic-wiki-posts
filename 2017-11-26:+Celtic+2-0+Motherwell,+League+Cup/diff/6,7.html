Sinclair dived. Little sympathy for Motherwell  though. Moult did the exact same thing five minutes before only he  didn&#39;t get away with it and Kipri is a complete thug who shouldn&#39;t have  even been on the park at that point.<br><br><br>(fatboab of KDS)<br>Excellent <br><br>Much better second half, even Sinclair looked more like himself. Great first goal, wonder save from Gordon, then controversy.<br>I  think it was a certain penalty , but never a red card. However ,  Thomson had made such a pigs ear of the first half, he probably took the  easy way to even things up. The tackle on Dembele was a red all day  long, but we never even got a free kick. I seem to remember a very soft  penalty against us at a crucial time in the Semi Final against Neil  Lennons Hibs. Strange that Lenny wasn&rsquo;t quite as vocal that day.<br><br>A well deserved fourth trophy for BR, and a great recovery from Wednesdays trauma. It&rsquo;s a pity Moussas face was tripping him.On to Fir Park, and a battle royale against these cloggers. 						 						 						 					<br><br><br>(bmh of KDS)<br>All this self victimisation from poor wee Motherwell will probably only  give them an over developed sense of the challenge they can actually put  up against us <br><br>You&rsquo;d think the game was 50/50 and &lsquo;well were giving us a run for our money and we could only use dirty tricks to get a break <br><br>The  fact we were winning had had by far the bulk of the chances having  played in the first half a bit lethargically after a mid week humping<br><br>They  should have been down to 10 within first 15 minutes but we still made  the best chances and got in behind them about 6 tines in the first half  hour - we sliced them open for the penalty and before the penalty <br><br>Oh - and the fact Sinclair was actually fouled! <br><br>But  hey - a ref even said a similar foul against hibs wasn&rsquo;t given cause he  stayed on his feet - so what message does that give players?

Scott Sinclair stands firm amid controversy<br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/definitely-a-penalty-scott-sinclair-stands-firm-amid-controversy-1-4624160<br>Scott Sinclair lifts the cup but there were doubts over his penalty claim. Picture: SNS <br><br><br>Andrew Smith<br><br>Published: 09:39 Monday 27 November 2017 <br>Share this article<br>&bull; <br>&bull; <br>&bull; <br>25 <br>Have your say <br>Scott Sinclair yesterday chose to brush off the penalty controversy that Celtic&rsquo;s Betfred Cup final win left him embroiled in. He did so with a fuss as minimal as the contact that earned it.<br>The 28-year-old winger was breezily unapologetic about hitting the turf after Motherwell&rsquo;s Cedric Kipre did little more than brush him with a 59th-minute action that looked like a failed tug but gave referee Craig Thomson a decision to make. <br>Sinclair was accused of diving by both the Fir Park side and BT pundits Neil Lennon, Chris Sutton and Terry Butcher in an incident that brought a red card for the French defender. However, the player maintained there was no dubiety over a spot-kick that allowed Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; men to move into an unassailable 2-0 lead.<br>&ldquo;I have got through and felt some contact; I felt he pulled me back and I&rsquo;ve gone down. It was definitely a pen. I&rsquo;ve no qualms about that,&rdquo; said Sinclair, who was not interested in debating the merits of the subsequent red card. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s up to the referee. If he didn&rsquo;t pull me then I think I&rsquo;m through on goal one-v-one. So that&rsquo;s the ref&rsquo;s decision but it&rsquo;s definitely a penalty.&rdquo;<br>Sinclair believes it was &ldquo;patience&rdquo; rather than a penalty that paid off in silverware for a fourth straight trophy success for the club the Englishman joined from Aston Villa in a &pound;3.5m deal. That was how his manager Rodgers presented the challenge for his players in a half-time team talk that followed Motherwell shackling the, now, 65 domestic games unbeaten Scottish champions across a cat-and-mouse first period.<br>&ldquo;He is always calm,&rdquo; Sinclair said. &ldquo;The word he used was patience. He told us we were in a game in which we had to be patient, keep possession, keep going side-to-side and finally we would break them down. The games are getting tougher. They see me as a target, I&rsquo;m getting doubled up on which does free up someone, but the whole team was being suffocated and it&rsquo;s down to us to keep battling.&rdquo;<br>It was a momentous trophy win for deadlock breaker James Forrest, whose exquisite finish just after the break made him only the second Celtic player after Bobby Lennox to score in three League Cup final victories for the club. <br>&ldquo;You want to play in cup finals for Celtic and win trophies and there&rsquo;s nothing better than scoring and helping the team out. It&rsquo;s excellent to contribute and I&rsquo;m hungry to win more,&rdquo; said the 26-year-old.<br>Forrest is developing into a performer who can raise his level in the big occasion. He excelled in the recent valiant display against Bayern Munich and has scored vital goals to take the club into the prestigious Champions League group stages across his career. <br>Moreover, with yesterday bringing him an eighth goal of this campaign, he has now equalled his best such tally for a season. He was expected to be understudy to a Patrick Roberts who instead has become that to him, and in doing so taken his game to a new level.<br>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling as good as I have in my career,&rdquo; Forrest said. &ldquo;As soon as the manager came in last season I got a lift and it turned into the best I&rsquo;d had, but the way I&rsquo;ve started this season has been even better and now I just want to keep that momentum going. <br>&ldquo;If you play with Celtic you must be ready to play in big games such as cup finals. That&rsquo;s a delight when you achieve that and we want to keep going and win as many as we can. It&rsquo;s relentless at this club with the game we play and we&rsquo;ve got to be ready to go again in midweek [against Motherwell at Fir Park].&rdquo;<br><br>Motherwell 0 - 2 Celtic: Controversy as Celtic win Betfred Cup<br>Celtic&#39;s James Forrest celebrates his goal to make it 1-0. Picture: SNS <br><br><br>Stephen Halliday<br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/competitions/league-cup/motherwell-0-2-celtic-controversy-as-celtic-win-betfred-cup-1-4623758<br>Published: 16:51 Sunday 26 November 2017 <br>Share this article<br>&bull; <br>&bull; <br>&bull; <br>196 <br>Have your say <br>Just as he exhorts his players to do so, Brendan Rodgers continues to write his own history at Celtic.<br>READ MORE - Motherwell manager blasts Celtic penalty decision in Betfred Cup final<br>In becoming the first manager since Jock Stein to retain the League Cup for the club, Rodgers has also achieved the unique feat of winning the first four domestic trophies he has contested in the job. It is a sequence which you suspect has plenty of mileage left in it.<br>Celtic&rsquo;s latest success under the relentlessly demanding Rodgers was tinged with controversy in the shape of a soft penalty awarded when Scott Sinclair went down under the flimsiest of challenges from Motherwell defender Cedric Kipre.<br>But the Scottish champions, after a scrappy first half which was impressively contested by Stephen Robinson&rsquo;s side, already had their noses in front through James Forrest&rsquo;s 49th strike when referee Craig Thomson made his contentious decision.<br>It was double jeopardy for Motherwell and the end of their hopes of a first major trophy since 1991 as Kipre was shown a straight red card for the offence before Moussa Dembele converted the spot-kick. <br>Twelve months ago, Celtic had this trophy wrapped up in green and white ribbons before half-time when they cruised to victory over Aberdeen. Until Kipre&rsquo;s departure, this was much more of a contest. Motherwell&rsquo;s determination to ensure this was the case saw them earn a huge ovation from their supporters when the interval arrived with the scoreline still blank. There was little doubt who was more satisfied with their work in the opening 45 minutes. Celtic were unable to exert their customary level of control over domestic opposition during this period with Motherwell goalkeeper Trevor Carson scarcely forced into any significant action.<br>He was well protected by those in front of him. Kipre, before his day went horribly sour, made a fine block to deny Stuart Armstrong a clear sight of goal at the end of one of Celtic&rsquo;s few piercing attacks in the early stages.<br>Kipre, pictured right, then dispossessed Dembele on the edge of the box with a robust challenge which left the Celtic striker nursing a painful left ankle. Dembele&rsquo;s unhappiness at the tackle, which went unpunished, saw him collect the first booking of the afternoon himself in the 15th minute when, still carrying his frustration from the earlier incident, he fouled Motherwell captain Carl McHugh with a studs-up challenge.<br>Motherwell&rsquo;s defensive focus was impressively intense and Forrest saw his shot smothered and deflected wide after a powerful Armstrong run had initially opened up some space in the penalty area.<br>Robinson&rsquo;s side also looked to be progressive whenever it was prudent. Richard Tait caught the eye on their right flank, his delivery causing concern in the Celtic box on a couple of occasions. It was Tait who had the first attempt of the day for his side, his shot sailing a couple of feet wide of Craig Gordon&rsquo;s left-hand post.<br>Carson was forced into his first save of the final in the 31st minute and had no trouble gathering a tame Dembele header from Mikael Lustig&rsquo;s cross.<br>It was a day when Motherwell would feel a set piece might give them their best opportunity to make a breakthrough. Jozo Simunovic&rsquo;s stray elbow in the face of Ryan Bowman offered them such a chance from around 25 yards but Louis Moult&rsquo;s well struck free-kick was clutched by Gordon high to his right.<br>Motherwell were visibly growing in confidence and threatened again three minutes before the break when another good cross from Tait was partially cleared by Dedryck Boyata, the ball falling to Chris Cadden who screwed his shot wide.<br>Celtic had lacked the dynamism and authority which have become their trademark during the long unbeaten domestic run under Rodgers but they rediscovered both in emphatic fashion to take charge at the start of the second half. Forrest&rsquo;s opener was sharply worked and expertly finished. There was suddenly greater tempo to Celtic&rsquo;s passing and the Motherwell defence were stretched as Dembele and Callum McGregor shuttled the ball across the edge of the penalty area into Forrest&rsquo;s path. The winger cut inside on to his left foot and bent a precise shot around the helpless Carson into the corner of the net.<br>Motherwell tried to find a quick response and were denied an equaliser four minutes later by a breathtaking reaction save from Gordon. The Celtic goalkeeper threw out his right arm to keep out Moult&rsquo;s powerful close-range header from Andy Rose&rsquo;s cross.<br>It proved to be a pivotal moment as the momentum of the final then swung irretrievably away from Motherwell with Kipre&rsquo;s concession of the penalty and dismissal. The defender&rsquo;s arm-to-arm touch of Sinclair, who burst clear of him into the area, was slight but enough for the Celtic winger to tumble to the turf.<br>Referee Thomson had little hesitation in pointing to the spot, that decision followed by the inevitable red card for a distraught and disbelieving Cipre. When the Motherwell protests subsided, Dembele stayed calm as he drilled the penalty straight down the middle to beat Carson.<br>The remaining half hour was reduced to a simple damage limitation exercise for 10-man Motherwell. Despite their leg-weariness, they somehow managed to prevent Celtic adding to their tally, although substitutes Leigh Griffiths and Patrick Roberts both came close.<br>Moult almost provided Motherwell with a moment of consolation in the final seconds of stoppage time when his free-kick smacked back off Gordon&rsquo;s left hand post but they had simply become just the latest victim of this Celtic team&rsquo;s insatiable desire for silverware. <br><br><br><br>Motherwell 0 - 2 Celtic: How the players rated on each side<br>Celtic&#39;s Stuart Armstrong looks to get the better of Carl McHugh.

Had little chance as James Forrest curled the ball just inside the post and just beaten by Moussa Dembele&rsquo;s penalty before making some good saves.<br>Richard Tait - 7<br>Really involved in the first half, getting forward from right-back. Put in one brilliant cross but failed to beat the first man from two others.<br>Charles Dunne - 6<br>Left-back did well to keep Celtic at bay until Forrest capitalised on a yard of space. <br>Cedric Kipre - 6<br>Defended brilliantly in the first half, although fortunate to get away with a challenge which caught Dembele&rsquo;s shin. Caught out by a through ball and very harshly sent off for making slight contact on Scott Sinclair with his arm.<br>Peter Hartley - 6<br>Made some strong tackles and clearances. Another who granted Forrest too much of an angle to find the opener.<br>Carl McHugh - 7<br>The captain was a solid base of Motherwell&rsquo;s midfield diamond, putting in tackles and interceptions, before moving back to central defence after the red card.<br>Liam Grimshaw - 6<br>Earned his place after impressing on his first start of the season against Aberdeen last week and put in a good shift in right midfield before making way early in the second half.<br>Andy Rose - 6<br>An excellent cross almost led to Louis Moult equalising. Given some trouble on the overlap but did well to get Motherwell up the park at times.<br>Chris Cadden - 6<br>Showed his versatility in several different midfield positions.<br>Ryan Bowman - 6<br>Criticised by Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers after the semi-final for using his elbows, he was caught on the head by Jozo Simunovic&rsquo;s arm. Held the ball up well at times but had few chances.<br>Louis Moult - 7<br>Must have thought he had headed an equaliser only to be thwarted by a world-class stop by Craig Gordon. Came close from two free-kicks, one hitting the post with the final kick of the ball. <br>SUBSTITUTES:<br>Craig Tanner (for Grimshaw, 51): Added some creativity to the Motherwell midfield. 6<br>Allan Campbell (for Bowman, 64): Motherwell were two goals and a man down when he came on. Worked hard and booked. 5<br>Elliot Frear (for Rose, 70): A difficult assignment on the left wing with Celtic using their man advantage. 5<br>CELTIC<br>Craig Gordon - 8<br>Made an absolutely outstanding reaction stop to prevent Moult&rsquo;s header levelling the scores. <br>Mikael Lustig - 6<br>Shrugged off a dead leg and gave Celtic a good attacking outlet at right-back. His sprint around Forrest looked to have played a key factor in the winger being granted space to net the opener.<br>Kieran Tierney - 7<br>Made some good forays forward and reliable at the back. Motherwell claimed for a penalty after he inadvertently tripped Moult, though it was deemed a simple coming together.<br>Jozo Simunovic - 6<br>Didn&rsquo;t always look comfortable and could perhaps have done more to launch attackers with Scott Brown tightly marked, but did enough to keep out Motherwell.<br>Dedryck Boyata - 6<br>A decent display from the Belgian, though he was thankful for his goalkeeper making a terrific save after Moult beat him to a cross ball from the left.<br>Scott Brown - 7<br>Grew into the game, especially after the red card when Motherwell were no longer able to tightly mark the Celtic skipper. Was accurate with his passing even when Celtic weren&rsquo;t at their slickest.<br>Stuart Armstrong - 7<br>His strong running helped create a few opportunities, including a couple for himself in the second period where he twice tested Carson from long range.<br>James Forrest - 8<br>Looked a threat in the first half even when Celtic were struggling to find their rhythm, and delivered a brilliant finish to open the scoring.<br>Callum McGregor - 7<br>Bright and lively, his quick pass set up Forrest for the first goal.<br>Scott Sinclair - 6<br>Went down very easily after the slightest of touches from Kipre to win his team a penalty and spark a controversial red card. He used the space to cause problems after a quiet first half.<br>Moussa Dembele - 6<br>A couple of wayward headers and a booking before seeing his penalty go in straight down the middle of the goal.<br>SUBSTITUTES:<br>Leigh Griffiths (for Dembele, 64): Hit the post and threatened with a free-kick. 6<br>Tom Rogic (for McGregor, 89): Last year&rsquo;s Hampden hero in the Scottish Cup had to settle for a cameo. 4<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  BBC<br><br>By Tom English<br><br>BBC Scotland at Hampden Park<br><br> From the section Scottish League Cup 542 <br><br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers hands the League Cup to captain Scott Brown<br>Brendan Rodgers is the first Celtic boss in 47 years to win four domestic trophies in a row<br><br>Brendan Rodgers became the first Celtic boss since Jock Stein to win four domestic trophies in a row as his side retained the Scottish League Cup.<br><br>Motherwell held their own until James Forrest curled an excellent shot into the far corner shortly after the break.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s Craig Gordon saved superbly from a Louis Moult header.<br><br>But &#39;Well&#39;s hopes ended when Cedric Kipre was controversially sent off for a brush with Scott Sinclair, and Moussa Dembele rolled in the penalty.<br><br>Motherwell, whose only League Cup triumph came in 1950, looked capable of recording their first win over the Glasgow side in six national cup finals until Forrest struck his third goal in three League Cup final appearances.<br><br>And, once Kipre was dismissed and the penalty dispatched, Stephen Robinson&#39;s side never looked like preventing last season&#39;s Treble-winners clocking up a 65th domestic game without defeat and their 17th victory in their 32nd League Cup final.<br>Celtic&#39;s James Forrest curls in the opening goal<br>James Forrest curled in the opening goal for Celtic at Hampden<br><br>For 45 minutes, this final was a battle, a dour struggle full of heavy tackles, misplaced passes, no rhythm and no semblance of anything that might have lifted you off your seat.<br><br>Motherwell wanted it that way.

I&#39;m sure Stephen [Robinson] will feel it&#39;s a bit harsh being a sending off. But it&#39;s definitely a penalty.<br><br>&quot;We managed the 11 v 10 very well. Sometimes you see it when you&#39;re playing against the man down and you can go a bit loose, but our positioning was good and we broke away. We should have made the game a lot more comfortable with the chances that we had.<br><br>&quot;My idea after midweek was just to try to get the win and play well. The players deserve a huge amount of credit. We came back after the midweek - a sore one to take - but the culture that we created the process by which we review that allows us to come in with a real positive attitude, to work well.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a trophy for everyone at the club. The support was amazing, really helping the team, the backroom staff and the work that they put in, combined with the players.&quot;<br><br>BBC<br>Celtic: Craig Gordon dismisses Scott Sinclair criticism after Hampden penalty<br><br>By Kheredine Idessane<br><br>BBC Scotland<br><br> 2 hours ago From the section Celtic <br><br>Scott Sinclair and Cedric Kipre<br>Cedric Kipre conceded a penalty and was sent off in Motherwell&#39;s 2-0 cup final defeat by Celtic<br><br>Craig Gordon is adamant Celtic team-mate Scott Sinclair &quot;doesn&#39;t go down easily&quot; despite the controversy over the penalty the winger won at Hampden.<br><br>Motherwell&#39;s Cedric Kipre was sent off after Sinclair went down in Sunday&#39;s League Cup final, with Moussa Dembele converting the resulting penalty.<br><br>But goalkeeper Gordon, whose side won 2-0, claims Sinclair always tries to stay on his feet.<br><br> Penalty call &#39;hard to take&#39; - Robinson<br> Moult questions two penalty decisions<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s a type of player that does try and score goals,&quot; said Gordon, 34.<br><br>&quot;Thinking back to the game here against Hibs in the last minute, he&#39;s straight through, I think it was Efe Ambrose tried to bring him down, he stays on his feet to try and have a shot at goal and they clear it away. We only get a draw when it should&#39;ve been a penalty.<br><br>&quot;This time he does go to ground to get the penalty. You can&#39;t have both things.<br><br>&quot;What I would say about Scott is he doesn&#39;t go down that easily at all.<br><br>&quot;He wants to score goals. If he had the possibility of trying to put that in the back of the net himself, I&#39;m pretty sure he would take it.<br><br>&quot;He&#39;s always looking to shoot, perhaps even when there&#39;s passes on, so he&#39;s a goalscorer.&quot;<br>Craig Gordon&#39;s save denies Louis Moult<br>Craig Gordon denied Louis Moult an equaliser for Motherwell<br><br>Gordon made a fine save to deny Louis Moult after Celtic had taken the lead through James Forrest at Hampden<br><br>&quot;That was an important one very soon after we scored,&quot; he said. &quot;It probably seemed to deflate the Motherwell players a little bit at that time.<br><br>&quot;We went through a few gears at the start of that second half and I think we were all very confident at that point, especially after that save, that we were going to go on and win the game.<br><br>&quot;That one will be right up there for the importance of it being a cup final and being a moment in the match that turned the tide our way.&quot;<br><br>Victory at the national stadium extended Celtic&#39;s unbeaten run in domestic matches to 65, 64 of which have been under manager Brendan Rodgers.<br><br>&quot;We want to stretch our unbeaten run as long as possible and that&#39;s all we&#39;re concentrating on,&quot; added Gordon ahead of Wednesday&#39;s Premiership meeting with Motherwell at Fir Park.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s a good record, one that we&#39;re very proud of. We will get beat one day, we&#39;re aware of that, but that&#39;s what drives us on to keep trying to better it and keep winning every match.&quot;  <br><br><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Match ends, Motherwell 0, Celtic 2.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Full Time</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+4&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Second Half ends, Motherwell 0, Celtic 2.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+3&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Louis Moult (Motherwell) hits the right post with a right footed shot from outside the box from a direct free kick.</div></div></div><div class="gs-o-media__body"><h3 class="lx-stream-post__header-title gel-great-primer-bold">Booking</h3></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+3&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Scott Brown (Celtic) is shown the yellow card for a bad foul.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+3&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Foul by Scott Brown (Celtic).</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+3&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Louis Moult (Motherwell) wins a free kick in the defensive half.</div></div></div><div class="lx-stream-post__meta">Posted at 90&#39;+2&#39; </div><div class="lx-stream-post__body gel-body-copy"><div class="lx-rta lx-stream-post-body"><div class="lx-stream-post-body">Attempt saved.
