Prior to Scotland, he had high hopes having played for PSG and then with West Bromwich Albion. With the later, he helped them to the top tier and was a regular with the club for many years. <br><br>He later had a spell with Norwich before moving to Kilmarnock, and had even scored a winner for Kilmarnock v Celtic in Feb 2018 in a 1-0 defeat for Celtic.<br><br>At the time of his transfer in, the Celtic support were making their voices heard loudly, especially as the first team had missed out on the Champions League qualification. Why if he was free couldn&#39;t Celtic have brought him in a month or two earlier it was asked? <br><br><div>Not exactly in his prime, arriving at 31 years old, he said: </div><blockquote><div><i>&quot;I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m old. I showed last year that I still have legs, I  can run and I have the experience as well which is very good for the  squad.&quot;</i></div></blockquote><div></div><div><br>Possibly his motivation in part at this stage in his life was a chance to finally win some major silverware that had eluded him through his entire career to date. A laudable ambition.<br><br>Anyhow, a squad filler but one role he accepted. He was a big midfielder, more in the old style of looking to shore up the defensive aspect and win the ball, driving it forward by force. Not elegant, but it did the job when it worked.<br><br>His debut was a 2-1 defeat to Kilmarnock in the league to his old club, who were to surprise everyone that season with their form, and incredibly for the 2018 calendar year were the top performing league side (would have won the title if it was done Jan-Dec 2018). Mulumbu had been the subject of the Kilmarnock supporters&rsquo; rage after a series of ill-tempered tussles with Aaron Tshibola that led to both men being booked by the referee as he struggled to retain control. </div><div></div><div><br>He soon after played for Celtic in a one-sided defeat to high-flying RB Salzburg in the Europa League group stages, and was then dropped to the bench. As he said of the opposition &amp; the result: <b><br></b><blockquote><i>&ldquo;When you look at the game last night it looks we respected them too much&quot;.</i><br></blockquote><br>One game that highlighted his flaws was when coming on against RB Leipzig as a sub at home in the Europa League. Celtic won the game 2-1, but he was clearly out of his depth at this level, lack of certain experience meant he couldn&#39;t manage this game and there were concerns. <br><br>Regardless, he still gave his all, but he needed to work on those deficiencies, but at a Celtic beginning to stutter in the challenge for the league title, chances for Mulumbu were becoming more difficult to get.</div><div></div><div></div><div><br>His transfer in was always as back-up support for the team. He never disgraced himself on the field, and there was a general respect for his efforts. <br><br>He was loaned out to Kilmarnock after just half a season in January 2019, which signalled the end of his chances at Celtic. So he had arrived from Kilmarnock, scored a winner v Kilmarnock and now heading back there on loan. It was as if he was tied to the club. It was actually a great time to be with Kilmarnock, as they had a fine season finishing third under manager Steve Clark who was to become the Scotland manager at the end of the season. <br><br>He was released a year early from his contract in July 2019 (Celtic exercising an option after one year of the two year contract), just as Mulumbu had returned from the African Cup of Nations. It was inevitable and all for the best.<br><br>We wished him the best.</div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>Quotes</h3><div>&quot;Joining Celtic means for the first time in my life I will be able to compete to be a champion and win trophies.

Craig Fowler  looks at the positives of the deal but also what it says for the club&rsquo;s  recruitment.At the end of a frustrating transfer window for Celtic fans,  management staff and players, the Hoops finally appear to have signed  the man to replace Stuart Armstrong and bolster their midfield corps.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>Youssouf Mulumbu arrives at the club following a  successful spell with Kilmarnock last season. At times the Congolese  international looked a cut above in Scottish football. Supporters will  often know little about incoming players from other Scottish clubs, as  they tend to spend games focusing on their own side, but every member of  the Parkhead faithful must surely remember Mulumbu&rsquo;s devastating  performance in Killie&rsquo;s 1-0 victory over Brendan Rodgers&rsquo; men in  February.<div class="p402_hide">           </div>While he&rsquo;s the replacement for Armstrong in terms of position,  he&rsquo;s a different player to the Scottish international. Armstrong was  known for his driving runs through lines and propensity to score  belters. Mulumbu, meanwhile, has the edge when it comes to strength and  close control.The 31-year-old can bully an opponent off the ball  and then embarrass him by producing a deft piece of skill to evade their  rebuke. He&rsquo;ll likely not start when everyone is fully fit, but with  Celtic competing on four fronts, he should get his fair share of game  time and sparkle in a Celtic uniform.He may even be used as a  stand-in for Scott Brown when the captain needs a rest. The reigning PFA  Scotland Player of the Year turned 33 over the summer and has already  witnessed his form waver a bit with Celtic&rsquo;s demanding early season  schedule. Expecting him to play just about every game is no longer  plausible. Though Mulumbu prefers to play further forward and is a  decent playmaker in that area, his composure on the football and  physical qualities would enable him to fill in as the enforcer in front  of the back four.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>He ticks a lot of boxes and arrives without a  transfer fee. No doubt, this should turn out to be a very good deal.  However, it&rsquo;s also another damning indictment of Celtic&rsquo;s transfer  strategy.Perhaps that&rsquo;s too harsh on the Parkhead hierarchy.  Perhaps they wanted Mulumbu as soon as the window opened but the player  was holding out for a move to the English Premier League which never  materialised. But seeing as Mulumbu has been available for a  pre-contract offer since January, and the way this summer has gone for  the Ladbrokes Premiership champions, not to mention the failed pursuit  for John McGinn, it seems far more likely that they&rsquo;ve been forced into  settling as the transfer deadline draws near.It&rsquo;s also a move  which questions the strength of Celtic&rsquo;s scouting network. Despite  having a designated head of recruitment in Lee Congerton and scouts  working for them across the globe, the club&rsquo;s transfer wishlist is  largely confined to those who impress in the Ladbrokes Premiership or a  promising youngster from an English Premier League side available for  loan.They have been recognised in recent years for signing some  of the brightest young stars in world football and selling them on for a  profit, if you think of Virgil van Dijk, Victor Wanyama and, soon to  be, Moussa Dembele.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>This summer transfer window even started in that  vain with the club breaking their transfer record to sign 20-year-old  Odsonne Edouard. But since then, for whatever reason, the well has gone  dry. This is despite them badly needing improvements at right-back,  centre-back, an additional option in midfield and a Dembele replacement  up front.Instead, they look set to settle for a pair of sticking  plasters in Mulumbu and Filip Benkovic. They should make an already  superior Scottish football squad even stronger, but they won&rsquo;t do much  to quiet the discord which exists among the supporters.<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>Youssouf Mulumbu set on being a &lsquo;big name&rsquo; at Celtic</h3><h3><a href="https://www.scotsman.com/author/Andrew.Smith1" target="_self"> 		                </a> 		            		             		        		        </h3><div class="article-meta__byline-info-container"> 		            <div class="article-meta__byline-name-container"> 		                		                     		                        Andrew Smith 		                     		                		            </div> 		            <div class="article-meta__byline-contact-list"> 		            		            		            </div> 		         </div> 				 								  				          								 				<div class="article-meta__timestamp article-meta__timestamp--same-day"> 		         		            Published: 		            06:00  		            		                Wednesday 05 September 2018</div><h3>https://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/youssouf-mulumbu-set-on-being-a-big-name-at-celtic-1-4794973<br></h3>A free transfer for a 31-year-old  in the form of Youssouf Mulumbu didn&rsquo;t exactly match up to Celtic  supporters&rsquo; demand for a &ldquo;big-name&rdquo; permanent signing in the closing  days of the transfer window. However, the midfielder who excelled in a  short spell for Kilmarnock last season is confident that in time he can  fit that bill for the club&rsquo;s faithful.                  &ldquo;Big names happen when you play well,&rdquo; said the  Democratic Republic of Congo international. &ldquo;I can be a big name in a  few months if I score against Rangers and play some good games. It&rsquo;s all  about your performances. I know there is pressure on the team and club  but I&rsquo;m ready for that. I&rsquo;ve got experience and ability to play. I&rsquo;m  ready and excited to be in  the squad.&rdquo;<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>Mulumbu has sufficient belief in his abilities to  believe he did not take a risk in biding his time during the window  before deciding where he would resume his career following his departure  from Rugby Park in May.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>&ldquo;I was really clear with my agent that I wanted to  play at the highest level possible,&rdquo; said the former Paris  Saint-Germain, West Bromwich Albion and Norwich City performer. &ldquo;The  highest level for me was the English Premier League but if it didn&rsquo;t  happen, the other option was Celtic.<div class="p402_hide">           </div>&ldquo;I can say I&rsquo;m lucky to be here. But at the same time, my  performances brought me. So it wasn&rsquo;t really a gamble because I knew  something big was going to happen for me. Now I just have to show why I  am a Celtic player.&ldquo;I first heard of Celtic&rsquo;s interest four weeks  ago. My agent called me and he had spoken to the board so after that I  had to have a chat with the manager. When a manager like Brendan Rodgers  calls then you don&rsquo;t hesitate. Once that happened it was: &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rsquo;&ldquo;Then  it was the longest two weeks of my life until the deal was finally  done. I had to be patient but I was texting my agent every hour, but I&rsquo;m  looking forward to it now. I&rsquo;m 31 but I still have the legs &ndash; once you  hit 30 in football people think you&rsquo;re old but I proved last season that  I can help this team.&ldquo;I was living in Glasgow before. I know the  city. I have experience of the pressure around this team. I am ready  for that challenge. I know I am going to do great for Celtic.&rdquo;<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>Mulumbu recognises the debt of gratitude he owes to  Steve Clarke and Kilmarnock, his former West Brom manager giving him  the opportunity to get going again following an unproductive 18 months  at Carrow Road. Indeed, he announced himself with a first goal to  deliver a 1-0 defeat on Celtic in early February.&ldquo;I have a huge  respect for Steve Clarke,&rdquo; Mulumbu said. &ldquo;I always say &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to  the people who help me and I think Kilmarnock were great for me. So I  contacted him to thank him for what he did  for me and he said he was  looking forward to seeing me on 26 September.&ldquo;I think every  member of the Kilmarnock squad called me along with the manager, the kit  man and some fans. I don&rsquo;t know how they had the number. It was great.  They sent me messages of congratulation. I am happy because when you do  well in the team and they recognise it ,it is [a good] part of  football.&rdquo;The player knows he will have to be &ldquo;sensible&rdquo; and &ldquo;patient&rdquo; to force his way into Rodgers&rsquo; side.<div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div><div class="p402_hide">                             <div class="ad-gpt adGPTTag adTagAsync">             </div>             </div>&ldquo;My talks with the manager were really clear,&rdquo; he  added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m aware of all the players here. It&rsquo;s a big club and there is  always competition. If you show up well in training and on the pitch,  then you are going to get your chance. I&rsquo;m here to help the young lads  like Olivier Ntcham and Callum McGregor. I know Scott Brown very well. &ldquo;I  can play in different positions, which is an advantage. Last year I  played No 10, behind the striker, I played  No 8, I can play No 6, a  holding midfielder. There are a couple of positions I can play. It  depends on where the manager wants to play me. Does he want to play  4-4-2 or 4-3-3? I can adapt, with my experience. So when the gaffer  calls, I&rsquo;ll be ready.&rdquo;<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  Youssouf Mulumbu to decide future after Congo duty as Celtic cut short deal</h3>https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48830372<br>By Stefan Bienkowski<br><br>BBC Sport Scotland<br><br> 58 minutes ago From the section Celtic <br><br>Mulumbu departs Celtic one year in to contract<br>Mulumbu departs Celtic one year into his contract<br><br>Youssouf Mulumbu will make a decision on his future on returning from the Africa Cup of Nations after Celtic cut short his contract by a year.<br><br>The 32-year-old Congolese midfielder is currently with his national team at the tournament in Egypt.<br><br>But he has departed the Scottish champions half way through a two-year deal, having joined from Premiership rivals Kilmarnock last summer.<br><br>Celtic activated a clause allowing them to cancel the deal.<br><br>Mulumbu made just three appearances for the Glasgow side before returning on loan to Kilmarnock in January for the remainder of the season.<br><br><br>He made 12 appearances as Kilmarnock finished third in the table under Steve Clarke, who has since become Scotland head coach.<br><br>The former West Bromwich Albion midfielder had earned his move to Celtic having impressed the previous season after joining the Ayrshire club following his departure from Norwich City.<br><br>Mulumbu was an unused substitute for DR Congo&#39;s 2-0 defeats by Uganda and hosts Egypt but returned to the starting line-up for a 4-0 win over Zimbabwe.<br><br><div>It leaves Florent Ibenge&#39;s squad awaiting the results from two more groups to see if they progress to the knock-out stage as one of the best third-placed sides. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><br></h3></div><div></div><br></div></div>
