Both sides mostly written off getting one of the top two spots due to Barca &amp; Man City being too far ahead in squad, financials etc. Both got heavily beaten in the first round of games.</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">So both playing for third for UEFA Cup spot, or the glimmer of hope for second at this point. Borussia M now back in for possible second spot after this result</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">Celtic going into the game had the slender advantage in that Celtic have one pt, Borussia M have 0pts so far. Both though coming into game on good performances, Celtic 3-3 with Man City, Borussia M unlucky to lose 2-1 to Barca (they were leading 1-0). Celtic were confident but failed.</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">Effectively Europe is over after this defeat, by most accounts for Celtic now. Can&rsquo;t see being third or higher now.

It&rsquo;s the fan who stands up and shouts &ldquo;give me a B...&rdquo;</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">BMG fans possibly to be charged for flares at game.</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">Mixed views on Toure, some blame him for the two goals, although many believe he was unlucky for both. Pragmatically, unlucky for first but blame for second, although others made far more mistakes in the game. He and Gordon together saved Celtic thru much of the game. Being the pro he is, he promptly took the burden for the loss in the post-match interviews, which we can respect.</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">Celtic held a family event in George Square, very well attended, with current and former players mingling with the support with loads of bon homie on the day.</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">Rotherham sack ex-Celt Alan Stubbs as manager; Scott Allan is on loan from Celtic there.</font></li><li><font face="Helvetica">A five-year-old Celtic fan has phoned the club to personally apologise for missing a game - because he was at a friend&rsquo;s birthday party.Celtic daft Louis was not best pleased when his mum, Lisa, explained to him he would be missing the recent win over Motherwell. So, fearing Scott Brown might notice he wasn&rsquo;t there, Louis got his mum&rsquo;s phone, found the Celtic website and hit the link to dial the number.Despite the youngster&rsquo;s absence, Celtic won the match 2-0.</font></li></ul></font><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Review<img align="right" alt="[Untitled]" height="275" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/6d5584202f9ab592c7f8443dfb7c6697/GW413H275" title="[Untitled]" width="413"></font></h3>(fatboab of KDS)<br>Well, that was hard.<br><br>We were well beaten by a very disciplined, organised side where every player knew his job and stuck to it. They had clearly watched us closely, and we gave them exactly what they expected. They killed service to our most dangerous players and stood all over Tom Rogic, who once again looked a yard off the pace. Credit to BMG though, they never switched off , and they thoroughly deserved their win, albeit two comedy goals won it for them.<br>Our biggest problem area is the middle of the park, where we have next to no pace, and we can&#39;t keep the ball at all we&#39;ll when pressed. This puts our backline under more pressure than need be. The Board have to back BR with hard cash in the next two windows to secure a  couple of top midfielders.<br>This group was always too hard for us this season. The result against Man City perhaps was disguising the real truth of he situation, but tonight was a reality check. No shame, no embarrassment, just a good hiding from a very good German side ho could easily finish second behind Barca.<br>Successes for us were few and far between, but Svietchenko deserves a medal for a wonderful shift, and it was good to see Craig Gordon looking more like his old self. No one else stood out, and young Tierney had a particularly miserable first half. He is a prospect all right, but he has loads to learn at this level. He did well to recover slightly in the second half. Kolo Toure had one of those nights, and maybe in hindsight, keeping him in cotton wool ( bar 10 late minutes on Saturday) since the Man City game has seen his fitness and sharpness of thought drop a level. <br>Rodgers will learn more from this than in most games this season. A good, but not great German side gave us a bit of a doing. Next season, all being well, I&#39;d expect us not to suffer a defeat of that nature. <br><br>(Arsene P of KDS)<br>It was a great night until the game kicked off.<br><br>Pretty obvious early on MGB had us sussed. We don&#39;t like and can&#39;t cope with being pressed.<br>They know where our weaknesses are and exploited them big-time.<br>We resorted to Euro away long ball humph tactics at times, and because our front men couldn&#39;t make the ball stick we just gave up possession.<br>We couldn&#39;t get through the well organised defensive line very often, and any time we did someone fluffed their lines.<br><br>The two goals were errors, but Gordon stopped it being a pumping.<br><br>We never got shots on target which doesn&#39;t help.<br><br>The mythical &quot;crowd being the 12th man&quot; effect was shot down last night. We tried but it just didn&#39;t happen.<br>The crowd feeds off the players, and they feed off the crowd etc but there was nothing to spark the initial onslaught.<br><br>MGB had the best away support I&#39;ve seen for a while from where I sat. &quot;You only zing ven you&#39;re vinnin&quot; made me smile.<br><br>At the end of the day, we can point to individuals and their mistakes but that is pointless. <br>It was plain that MGB play the style and at the level BR is striving to achieve and they have so many more better players in positions that are important to team systems.<br><br>We have a long way to go, BR knows this, and we shouldn&#39;t be too hard on a team that was mostly the same personnel as a Deila one. You can&#39;t suddenly make players who have proved not to be at elite Euro level into superstars. We have too many slightly below the level required to really make a mark on Europe.<br><br>If we get to Pot 3 level with the resources we have, I&#39;ll be happy.<br><br>Comedy moment was when Roberts had his cameo and Lustig cleaned him out. WTF was that all about, eh?<br><br>I won&#39;t be shocked if we don&#39;t score another goal in this competition this season. <br><br>We always have the treble to go for. If only we had an easy team in the semi-final of the League Cup... <br><br>(mubo L of KDS)<div>No point pretending otherwise, our European campaign is done. Sobering but true, if we get another point in this group it will be a minor miracle.<br><br>Congratulations Borussia Monchengladbach, you outclassed us on and off the park. <br><br>As for the game itself, one shot on target for us speaks volumes. Tactically we just couldn&#39;t expose their frailties, and provide Dembele with adequate service. Reflecting on the Juventus humping from 2013, it highlights Celtic&#39;s seemingly historic inability to succeed against European opposition that play three at the back. The way we were deployed by Rodgers also failed to negate their threat on the counter attack or playing on the shoulder of Toure with simple punts down the middle. Also I noticed that while the manager&#39;s previous comments about fan patience re circulating the ball, there were far too many sideways and backwards passing when we needed to be bolder. So while nobody doubted Brendan&#39;s starting eleven in terms of personnel, we were tactically outmaneuvered. <br><br>Player wise Toure was obviously abysmal and at fault for both goals, Efe-esque tonight. Bitton was atrocious, far too lackadaisical and doesn&#39;t have enough quality to account for that flaw. Tierney was positionally out of his depth tonight, learning curve and aw that. Brown and Rogic were ridiculously sloppy, with the latter completely off the pace in general. Sinclair had his least effective game for us by a country mile, got into some decent positions but provided zero end product. Lustig, Forrest and Dembele were mediocre to various degrees, while the only two players I&#39;d give some credit to were Sviatchenko, and more so Gordon for a few good saves.<br><br>So overall a very disappointing night, losing our most winnable group game is too big a setback for us to overcome, but in perspective all I wanted from this season was 6IAR and qualifying for the Champions League. That is almost certainly going to be achieved, and should we overcome this hangover by dispatching Sevco at the weekend, the first 20 games of the Rodgers era will still have been very much positive thus far.<br><br>A bitter reality check but one that I hope will benefit us on the continent next season.

was hoisted high before kick-off. A sentiment so drenched in nostalgia, noble though it was, might not have been the rallying cry Celtic were looking for. This was a night to forget.<br><br> Borussia belied their current position of ninth in the Bundesliga to post the victory that turns an already difficult task of securing European football beyond Christmas into a hugely problematic one for Celtic.<br> The German visitors don&rsquo;t always travel well to Scotland; high-scoring defeats against Rangers and Dundee United stretching back to 1960 attest to this. But this, their first away victory in the European Cup since they reached the final in 1977, was richly deserved.<br> </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Second-half goals by skipper Lars Stindl and Andre Hahn secured a win the visitors had threatened to take away from Celtic Park from almost the first kick.<br> But impressive though they were, Celtic were complicit in their own downfall. Kolo Toure was at fault for both goals, the first of which was whipped through Craig Gordon&rsquo;s legs after 57 minutes by Stindl. Hahn, man of the match, finished Celtic off with a fine strike with 13 minutes left after Toure had been robbed of possession.<br><br> Celtic slip to bottom of Group C with a vital return trip to Germany to be negotiated next.<br> Borussia&rsquo;s passing was always quick and crisp while Celtic&rsquo;s lacked certainty, perhaps even some belief. Indeed, the home side were grateful to Gordon for ensuring one of Borussia&rsquo;s early breaks forward did not produce the game&rsquo;s first goal.<br> The goalkeeper&rsquo;s save low to his left while seemingly unsighted from Ibrahima Traore&rsquo;s shot from the edge of the box once more vindicated his return to the side.<br> But the opening &ndash; if such an opportunist effort in a crowded box could be so termed &ndash; simply continued the trend of a game that was already slipping away from Celtic. This was a pattern maintained throughout; Celtic always seemed to be hanging on. <br> Gordon showed his worth when making a stop from Jonas Hofmann after 25 minutes and was then called on to palm Hahn&rsquo;s drive over.<br> It must have been concerning for manager Brendan Rodgers, whose pre-match manifesto was based around Celtic imposing themselves on their opponents, something they managed &ndash; to an extent &ndash; against Manchester City last month.<br> But they struggled to break out of their own half for long spells. Scott Brown was too ponderous on those rare occasions he had the ball and Celtic&rsquo;s defence was stretched to the point that it was impossible to imagine Borussia failing to make a breakthrough sooner or later.<br> But Toure and his companions dug in. They weathered the storm and the score still being level at 0-0 at half-time represented a mini victory for Celtic, who now had the opportunity to compose themselves. By this same stage of their last Champions League outing they had scored two and conceded two on a breathless night against Manchester City.<br> But underlining just how unfathomable football often is, Celtic left the field harbouring a twinge of regret that they were not in fact in front.<br> Having failed to put the visitors&rsquo; goal any under form of sustained pressure, wonderful skill combined with vision by Tom Rogic in midfield created a precious opening. His pass split Borussia&rsquo;s defence and, though the angle was tight, Sinclair should have done far better than to blaze the ball over.<br> But it was a sign there could still be something in this game for Celtic, who were unchanged at the start of the second-half. That all three substitutes had been used by midway through the same half indicates how badly, and quickly, things then unravelled.<br> But Celtic had posted some notice of their intent just after the break. As the fug of cordite from flares wafted across the stadium from the away section, the home side sought to create some fireworks of their own.<br> Sinclair sent a header wide from a good position to offer some hope of the game being provided with a new dynamic. The fans were desperate to see Celtic on the front foot. But a chip from Tobias Strobl drifted past Gordon&rsquo;s far post.<br> The goal Borussia deserved arrived soon after and, while they had earned the right to be in front, it was a frustratingly preventable goal as far as Celtic were concerned.<br> Toure sought to shepherd a through ball out of play but the impressive Hahn dived in and flicked it back into the danger area. Stindl reacted before Erik Sviatchenko to whip the ball into the net through Gordon&rsquo;s legs.<br> Embarrassing though this might have been for the &rsquo;keeper, the fault lay elsewhere. Sviatchenko, one of the culprits, redeemed himself with a brilliant last-ditch tackle on Hahn.<br> But there was no such atonement for Toure, who gifted possession to the Germans after 77 minutes. Hahn still had much to do when the ball broke at his feet: his finish, high into the net, was impeccable.<br><br> Marks out of ten for every Celtic player after their Champions League loss at Parkhead.<br><br> Craig Gordon: 7<br> The goalkeeper made a terrific first-half save from Ibrahima Traor&eacute;, getting down well to stop the midfielder&rsquo;s low shot, before scrambling to recover the loose ball. Allowed the opening goal to escape between his legs, though it was hit with great pace from close range.<br> </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Mikael Lustig: 6<br> Defensively the Swedish international was solid - including a last-ditch challenge to deny Andr&eacute; Hahn a clear shot at goal in the first half - but his crossing left a lot to be desired on a night where he was the out-ball for Celtic going forward.<br> Kolo Toure: 5<br> Two unfortunate errors from the centre-back cost his side dearly. His second half performance was night and day from his first, where he made a couple of vitals blocks in the Celtic penalty area.<br> Erik Sviatchenko: 6<br> The Danish international&rsquo;s positioning was all over the place in the first half as he struggled to keep the shape of the back-line. He settled down after the break and had an accomplished second 45 minutes, including a terrific goal-saving tackle to deny Hahn running through.<br> Kieran Tierney: 6<br> Similar to Lustig, Tierney was fine in defence but struggled to make an impact at the other end. Gladbach did a great job of marshalling the full-back as he strode forward, and he couldn&rsquo;t make as many of his usual marauding runs as he would have liked.<br> Scott Brown: 6<br> Struggled in the opening 30 minutes alongside Nir Bitton as Celtic&rsquo;s wide open shape left the pair exposed against visiting attacks. He enjoyed a better second half, often retreating between the centre-backs to get attacks started.<br> Nir Bitton: 5<br> Struggled to keep up with the pace of the M&ouml;nchengladbach attacks in the first half as wide-men Traor&eacute; and Jonas Hofmann enabled the visitors to outnumber their opponents in the centre by drifting inside. Got to grips with things a little bit more after half-time, but was deservedly subbed for McGregor&rsquo;s mobility once Celtic went a goal down.<br> James Forrest: 6<br> A quiet night for the attacker who was pinned back in his own half for the most part and never got the chance to use his pace to run at the opposing defence. Hooked for Patrick Roberts.<br> Tom Rogic: 7<br> One of Celtic&rsquo;s more accomplished players on the day, though by his recent high standards he wasn&rsquo;t at his best. Found space hard to come by but did manage to thread through a terrific through ball for Sinclair. Subbed for Leigh Griffiths.<br> Scott Sinclair: 7<br> The miss which followed Rogic&rsquo;s pass aside, Sinclair had the strongest game of any Celtic attacker and always looked the player most likely to grab Celtic a goal. On another day he might just have managed it.<br> Moussa Dembele: 6<br> Worked hard throughout the match but never got the service required to reproduce his heroic performance against Manchester City three weeks ago.<br> Substitutes<br> Callum McGregor (for Bitton, 63 mins): 5 - Added some much needed energy in the centre.<br> Leigh Griffiths (for Rogic, 71 mins): 5 - Ball didn&rsquo;t quite break for him on a couple of occasions inside the penalty box.<br> Patrick Roberts (for Forrest, 73 mins): 5 - Had one great run, but otherwise not much time to make an impact.<br> <br> </font><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><font color="#000000" face="Times New Roman" size="3">  </font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3">BBC<br></font><font face="Calibri"><font color="#000000" size="3"> Two second-half mistakes from Kolo Toure gifted Borussia Monchengladbach a Champions League victory at Celtic.<br> The visitors dominated the first half but Celtic held firm, and even passed up a good chance when Scott Sinclair sliced over from close range.<br> However, Lars Stindl drove in the visitors&#39; first goal after Andre Hahn robbed Toure of possession.<br> Hahn made it two when he raced past Toure to score following the Ivory Coast defender&#39;s poor pass.<br><br> Out of media player. Press enter to return or tab to continue.<br> Brendan Rodgers says Borussia Monchengladbach were worth their 2-0 Champions League win.<br> The Germans came here without some stellar names, most notably chief goalscorer Raffael and one of their most creative players, Thorgan Hazard. Both missed out through injury, a bout of misfortune Celtic would have hoped to exploit.<br> They were unable to. Too many Celtic players were out of sorts, in their passing, their concentration, their aggression. They were out-played and out-fought. Celtic were lucky to lose by only two goals.<br> Gladbach did something Manchester City could not when they were here a few weeks back - they kept Celtic down and kept their vast support largely hushed. If two of their most dangerous players were absent, they had others.<br></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"><br></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> Ibrahima Traore, Tobias Strobl and, most tellingly, the excellent double act of Stindl and Hahn, moved it quickly and found space time and again. They got in behind their hosts and asked all sorts of questions. <br> Traore had a shot saved wonderfully by Craig Gordon, then Jonas Hofmann forced another stop from the Celtic goalkeeper. Just after, Hahn had a decent effort, then Strobl caused some bother. <br> Celtic could not hold on to the ball and could not do anything with the ball they kept. This was the polar opposite of the thrill-fest against Manchester City.<br> Andre Hahn (right) and Kolo Toure<br> Andre Hahn (right) races past Kolo Toure for the second goal<br> Gladbach&#39;s dominance continued after the break. They were pacy and intelligent and far too much for Celtic. Eventually, they found their ruthlessness in front of goal, too. <br> Toure had a double meltdown. For the first, he tried to see a ball out for a goal-kick only to be ransacked of possession by Hahn, who managed to scramble a pass to Stindl, who shot past Gordon.<br> Later, after Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers had made his move by bringing on Leigh Griffiths to play alongside Moussa Dembele, Gladbach scored again. Toure gave it away and Hahn took advantage, motoring through on the Celtic goal and finishing brilliantly. <br> Brendan Rodgers (left) and Kolo Toure<br> Brendan Rodgers (left) consoles Kolo Toure at full-time<br> Given that Gladbach were missing four key first-team players, this was Celtic&#39;s chance to secure a precious victory, a win that would have put them in the box seat for a third-place finish in the group - and Europa League football beyond Christmas. <br> That hope is withering now. Celtic&#39;s away record in Europe is horrendous, and when Celtic go to Germany the probability is their hosts are going to have their injured men fit again. If they cannot beat a diminished Gladbach in Glasgow, what chance of overturning this loss on the road?<br> After the giddy highs of that classic against Manchester City, this was a return to sobriety for Rodgers&#39; team.<br> Match ends, Celtic 0, Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach 2.<br> Full Time<br> </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> 90&#39;+4&#39; <br> Second Half ends, Celtic 0, Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach 2.<br> </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font face="Calibri"><br></font></font></font><font color="#000000" face="Calibri" size="3"> 90&#39;+4&#39; <br> Attempt blocked.
