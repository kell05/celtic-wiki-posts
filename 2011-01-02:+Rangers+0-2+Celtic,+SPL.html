Lennon has been derided by many as being tactically inept to date but this time he got it all right and played Walter Smith at his own game. <br> <br> Stories were abounding that this game was going to be called off due to large scale damage from pipes bursting from the cold freak weather. The huns will wish it had been. <br> <br> Must add the impecably well respected minute silence today. It was the 40th anniversary of the Ibrox disaster when tragucallt 66 died. RIP... Sadly the papers and huns had stoked it beforehand disgustingly that we wouldn&#39;t respect it. It was cheap point scoring with no basis to it. It&#39;s disturbing just how low some will go in these matters. We as a club have always shown respect where deserved and this was no exception. <br> <br> First half was an overly nervous affair that saw Rangers fortunately have a shot cleared off the line by Izzy in the first minutes. After that it was a midfield battle with few if any real shots on target. Rangers had the better of the first 20 minutes whilst we had the edge on the last 20.<br> <br> Second half was much different. Paddy McCourt should have scored soon after the restart but it really was all Celtic thereafter. Hero of the day was surprisingly Samaras who hadn&#39;t scored in the league all season. An end to end goal which began with a marvellous long reacher to Samaras gave him the chance to take on the hun defence round the keeper and score! Cue a celebration. <br> <br> Second goal was Samaras inviting the hun defence to bring him down for a penalty, which he converted. Ridiculous was that the culprit was not booked as Boughera would have then been sent off. Could have made a material difference as he later had a chance to score to put the huns back in. Thankfully he missed and we remained on top to end the game with a bright start to the new year.<br> <br> First new year victory at Castle Mordor since 1985 or so. Must add lots of great performances today especially from Rogne, Kayal and McCourt. <br> <br> Happy days but there is still a long way to go in this league campaign and if the huns win their games in hand then they will keep their noses in front. <br> <br> For Lennon he has bought some needed respect from the support and finally won a must win game. <br> <br> Berwick Rangers next Sunday in the cup. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Quotes<br></h3>&quot;Very funny image of Neil Lennon today smiling at the humanities  students and other renowned liberals packed into that Rangers  enclosure...&quot;<br><b>GrahamSpiers (lol)</b><br><br>&quot;The minute&#39;s silence today at Ibrox was certainly impressive. For 50,000 to gather like that was quite something.&quot;<br>&quot;Various: haven&rsquo;t seen Bill Leckie&rsquo;s piece today. But the minute&rsquo;s silence at Ibrox yesterday was about as impeccable as any I&rsquo;ve witnessed.&quot;<br>&quot;Have  just watched the &lsquo;damning evidence&rsquo; of &lsquo;coughgate&rsquo; at Ibrox. It&rsquo;s   laughable. All you &#39;hear&#39; is the general hush of a silent stadium..&quot;<br>&quot;If this is &#39;damning evidence&#39; then someone is utterly, utterly desperate..a few coughs amid an impeccably-observed silence??&quot;<br>&quot;Please,   no more on &lsquo;coughgate&rsquo;. The tape is probably the most feeble of all  the  Old Firm &lsquo;whataboutery&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve ever come across. Farcical&quot;<br><b>Graham Speirs (twitter)</b><br><br>&quot;I gather that a few of us in the media have been contacted by Rangers  fans who are outraged, disgusted and generally appalled at the  disgraceful behaviour of those Celtic fans who apparently showed wanton  disrespect during Sunday&#39;s minute&#39;s silence for the 66 victims of  Stairway 13.<br>Quite honestly, I watched the minute&#39;s silence with my  heart in my mouth and was mightily relieved when a contemplative hush  fell over Ibrox. It seems, though, the silence wasn&#39;t silent enough for  some desperadoes among the Rangers support.&quot;<br><b>Tom English (The Scotsman)</b><br><br> &quot;THE silence spoke volumes. And it talked well of the Old Firm. <br>  Yesterday could have been another embarrassing episode in the story of  our little country but for once the correct image was beamed from Ibrox  and around the world. <br> This time the Old Firm were shown in a brighter, much more respectable light. <br>  It was 40 years ago to the day when 66 supporters lost their lives on  Stairway 13 of Rangers&#39; ground and there were fears a minute of silence  to remember and honour the dead might be disrupted. It was impeccably  observed. It would have taken only onevoice, one idiot to call out and  others might have reacted. There would have been a chain reaction which  would have shamed all of us. But there was profound silence.&quot;<br><b>Jim Traynor (Daily Record)</b><br><br>&quot;What a day  it has been. Walking down Shieldhall Rd towards Ibrox this morning my  head was telling me we were on to a shagging and my heart was telling me  we were going to win. I have to admit that when I heard our starting XI  it didn&#39;t exactly fill me with confidence, but my God, Neil Lennon you  got it spot on sir. And as Billy McNeill led our Bhoys out, I was filled  with a great deal of pride and joy. Our support was phenomenal today;  the minute&#39;s silence was impeccably observed and after that we out-sang  those huns brilliantly. And so onto the game, as the huddle went down  and the smoke bombs went up I just had a feeling inside that it was  going to be our day. We survived the pressure for the first 10 mins, God  only knows what would have happened if Izzy hadn&#39;t cleared that header  off the line. After that 10 min spell we took control in the midfield,  Kayal was outstanding and he and Ledley certainly bossed McCulloch and  Ness. We look like we&#39;ve definitely got a hun skelper in the form of  Kayal. There weren&#39;t many chances in the first half but we sang our  hearts out anyway! The second half started in a similar fashion but it  was clear we had the upper hand. And then came a moment of sheer  unbridled joy that I will remember for the rest of my life. Ledley sent a  perfect ball over Bougherra&#39;s baldy napper to find Gorgeous Georgios  who took the ball past Mcshagger and slotted it home. I can honestly say  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever celebrated a goal like that before; I ended up  three rows in front of me. Definitely beats getting your hole. And then 8  mins later Samaras picked the ball up on the half way line and danced  down the wing beating a hun cutting inside and then beating another hun,  being scythed down in the process. And as they say the rest is history,  the big Greek slotted the ball home. Cue bedlam once again amongst our  supporters and a big massive perty commenced in Free Broomloan. What a  sweet feeling that was! And as the Depeche Mode song goes I really just  couldn&#39;t get enough and we jumped and bounced and sang ourselves to  exhaustion for the rest of the game. And the final whistle blew and the  players came down to us and you could see they realised how much it  meant and how much they appreciated our support today. We were  incredible on the field and off of it. And then Neil Lennon came down  and I&#39;m not ashamed to say that the emotion got to me and I started to  well up, because he knew how much today meant to each and every one of  us and he had those players fighting for us and our cause. And that&#39;s  why I adore Lennon and that is why I love Celtic. And today is why I  will always love Celtic and why they are such an important part of my  life. What a day and what a performance from the team and every single  one of us who were there. God bless and Hail!

merited but    contrary to most expectations &ndash; of favourites for the current Scottish    championship. On January 2 1971 a 1-1 draw in the traditional New Year Old    Firm derby was sufficient to allow Jock Stein&rsquo;s team to maintain their    distance from Rangers but the calamitous aftermath of that occasion &ndash; the    Ibrox Disaster that left 66 dead and 145 injured on the steps of Stairway 13    &ndash; cast a pall over the season.  </div><div class="secondPar">  The rebuilt Ibrox was designed to provide a safe arena for passions, such as    the raucous exchanges of the Glasgow rivalry, to be vented within its    confines. On Sunday, it was required to act as a forum for remembrance of    the tragedy that led to its reconstruction.  </div><div class="thirdPar">  Rangers, arrayed in a commemorative jersey, were led out by John Greig, the    man who captained them four decades ago. It was profoundly touching to see    him march across the turf alongside Billy McNeill, the Celtic skipper of    that era, to a heartfelt reception from the fans, both sets of whom observed    the subsequent minute&rsquo;s silence impeccably.  </div><div class="fourthPar">  Appropriate respect then gave way to customary bedlam as the overture to a    fixture that was widely predicted to run more comfortably for Rangers, under    the wily and experienced supervision of Walter Smith, than for Celtic, who    had made heavy weather of the five consecutive home fixtures that preceded    this game.  </div><div class="fifthPar">  Moreover, Neil Lennon had been deprived of the services of a raft of players    who would have started or been in contention. Scott Brown, the Celtic    captain, was suspended, the South Korean pair of Cha Du Ri and Ki Sung Yeung    are on international duty at the Asian Cup, while Shaun Maloney, Gary    Hooper, Olivier Kapo and Daryl Murphy are injured.  </div><br><br><div class="body">  Much of the pre-match speculation concerned Freddie Ljungberg, who signed for    Celtic on Friday, but the former Arsenal midfield man had picked up a virus    and was also ruled out. In the event, he was not missed, although the    evidence of the opening quarter hour was that Celtic were about to be    bulldozed by a rampant Rangers team.  <br> That might well have happened had Lennon&rsquo;s players fallen behind within five    minutes, as they so nearly did. From a Vladimir Weiss corner kick, Lee    McCulloch&rsquo;s header beat Fraser Forster and was dropping inside the back post    when Emilio Izaguerre, stationed on the line, averted what looked a certain    goal by heading the ball up and off the crossbar to safety.  <br> That was as close as Rangers were to get to a goal, not that you would have    predicted as much. Smith had to do without Steven Naismith, his best player    this season, because of a hamstring injury and the manager responded with    the bold decision to grant the 18-year-old Jamie Ness his first start in    midfield.  <br> The youngster was deployed alongside McCulloch in front of Rangers&rsquo; back four    and he began with a couple of glorious crossfield passes that would have    done credit to Glenn Hoddle in his pomp. Lennon had opted for a match-up to    Rangers&rsquo; 4-2-3-1 but Celtic looked wholly uncomfortable with the shape.  <br> Crucially, though, the champions did not take advantage of their dominance    and, as Celtic adjusted to their formation midway through the half the game    deteriorated into an unappetising scrap, with creativity at a premium. It    quite likely would have stayed that way but for an uncharacteristically bad    decision by Allan McGregor on hour into the proceedings.  <br> Joe Ledley played a ball forward for Georgios Samaras to chase, not a ploy    that would usually discomfit Rangers, but in this instance David Weir and    Madjid Bougherra were caught level with each other as the pass went beyond    them. Even then McGregor would have done better to stay on his line but he    bolted out and was beaten to the ball by Samaras who turned his shot into    the empty net for his first goal since March 20 last year.  <br> Transformed utterly, Celtic unleashed waves of vigorous assaults on a Rangers    back line which crumpled in astonishing fashion. Bougherra was the next    culprit, toppling Samaras just inside the box to concede a penalty kick    which the Greek forward converted with brio.  <br> Celtic were en route to Neil Lennon&rsquo;s first big victory as a tyro manager and    a four point lead that, despite Rangers&rsquo; two games in hand, points strongly    to a change in the destination of this season&rsquo;s SPL championship. On this    day of all days, though, the result that mattered most was that 50,222    spectators could indulge in the cacophony of civil strife and be sure that    only their larynxes were in danger of harm.  <br> Match details  <br> Rangers (4-2-3-1): McGregor; Foster (Lafferty 67), Bougherra, Weir,    Papac; McCulloch, Ness (Hutton 82), Davis, Weiss, Whittaker; Miller.<br> Subs: (unused) Alexander (g), Webster, Fleck, Beattie, Kerkar.<br> Booked: Bougherra, Lafferty.<br> Celtic (4-2-3-1): Forster; Wilson, Rogne, Majstorovic, Izaguirre;    Ledley, Kayal; Forrest (McGinn 88), McCourt, Mulgrew; Samaras.<br> Subs: (unused) Zaluska (g), Juarez, Hooiveld, Towell, Crosas,    Stokes.<br> Booked: Wilson, Mulgrew.<br> Referee: Craig Thomson.   </div><br><br><h3>Telegraph</h3><div class="storyHead"> 	 	Celtic manager Neil Lennon makes sure that Rangers&#39; Kyle Lafferty gets the message after Old Firm triumph 		 	<br> Celtic supporters set off flares in the Broomloan Stand prior to kick-off but    the whiff of cordite, which is rarely far away when these teams clash, was    largely absent on the pitch on Sunday.   	</div> <div class="oneHalf gutter"> 				<div class="story"> 					<div> 			<div class="slideshow ssMain"> 				<div class="nextPrevLayer"> 							<div class="ssImg"> 									<br> 									<div class="artImageExtras"> 									 										<div class="ingCaptionCredit"> 											Are you listening?

Lennon shook every other Rangers    player&rsquo;s hand but offered the forward only the rough edge of his tongue. </div><div class="thirdPar">  In the aftermath of Rangers&rsquo; 3-1 victory at Parkhead in October Lafferty    tweeted some particularly insulting remarks about Lennon: this, for the    older man, was payback time and he wanted to ensure it was done face to face    and not from a computer keyboard. </div><div class="fourthPar">  When questioned about the incident, Lennon replied: &ldquo;You might read about it    on his Twitter page.&rdquo; The altercation, however, could not spoil the    manager&rsquo;s afternoon. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonderful feeling,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very, very    proud of my players. I didn&rsquo;t expect us to come here and be so dominant but    we took everything they could throw at us and we could have scored more    goals.&rdquo;  </div><div class="fifthPar">  Georgios Samaras had opened the scoring with Celtic&rsquo;s first effort on target    and completed the scoring from the penalty spot after drawing the foul from    Madjid Bougherra. </div> 	<div class="related_links_inline"> 			<div class="headerOne styleFour">Related Articles</div> 	 			 		</div> 	<div class="body">  They were not only the first goals the Greek had scored at Ibrox but the first    goals he has contributed in the league this season. Samaras is out of    contract come May but Lennon hopes he can be persuaded to extend his stay at    Parkhead. <br> &ldquo;Sammy doesn&rsquo;t want to leave this club,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He needs to be more    consistent but he knows that but we need to keep working and trying to get    the best out of him because he was unplayable out there. <br> &ldquo;Is it a mental thing with him? It could be. He&rsquo;s only 25 so he&rsquo;s yet to reach    his peak but now he&rsquo;s set this benchmark people will be expecting him to    play like that every week. We won&rsquo;t but he has all the attributes to be    anything he wants to be.&rdquo;  <br> Samaras, for his part, made it clear that his preference would be to remain in    Glasgow in spite of reported interest from Atletico Madrid and Sporting    Lisbon. <br> &ldquo;The crucial thing is that the manager wants me to stay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Celtic are    a massive club, known all around the world. <br> &ldquo;Every year we play European football and try to win trophies, which is the    most important thing for any player. At the end of your career you want to    sit down and remember what you&rsquo;ve won.&rdquo;  <br> Lennon is convinced that yesterday&rsquo;s triumph may prove to be the springboard    for them to prevent Rangers from winning a third successive title. <br> &ldquo;This result is huge in terms of the championship,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Most people had    written us off and said that my team didn&rsquo;t win the big games. Well, we&rsquo;ve    won this one and we&rsquo;ve done it in style.&rdquo;  <br> Rangers haven&rsquo;t won a New Year Old Firm match since 1997 and they could have    played until midnight and still not have found the net. <br> Walter Smith&rsquo;s side failed to force a save from Celtic goalkeeper Fraser    Forster and produced a performance riddled with unforced errors, with    Richard Foster&rsquo;s sloppy pass which led to the opening goal symptomatic of    their afternoon. <br> Lennon effectively Waltered Rangers, soaking up the pressure and hitting their    opponents on the break in the same manner that Smith&rsquo;s teams have plundered    results at Parkhead. <br> &ldquo;The first goal was always going to be vital,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;It gave Celtic    something to hold on to. They just sat back and we needed to score in order    to force them to come out but we just didn&rsquo;t create enough and that, along    with losing two poor goals, was the most disappointing aspect for us. <br> &ldquo;If Celtic had scored great goals then this result would have been easier to    take. I don&rsquo;t think that we were flat: sometimes you just have to give    credit to the opposition and the way they played worked very well for them.&rdquo;  <br> Two years ago Gordon Strachan&rsquo;s Celtic twice squandered a seven-point    advantage as Rangers came from behind to win the title and Rangers captain    David Weir is confident that they can do so again, particularly since    winning their two matches in hand would transform a four-point deficit into    a two-point lead. <br> &ldquo;We lost today but time will tell how big an influence that is on the eventual    outcome,&rdquo; said the 40-year-old defender. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a long way to go and    it&rsquo;s up to us to regroup, pick ourselves up and start again.&rdquo;</div></div></div></div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="headline"><h3>     Rangers 0-2 Celtic    </h3></div>                               <div class="bo">                                           </div>                              <div class="bo">                                           </div>                                                                                                                  By Clive Lindsay                                                                             (BBC)<br>                                                                                                              <b>                            Georgios Samaras scored twice to give Celtic a deserved victory  over Rangers that stretched the visitors&#39;

reshuffled pack that exerted early control and  almost took the lead after five minutes following a corner won after  Ness played a classy cross-field ball to Steven Whittaker.                             <br>                            Vladimir Weiss&#39;s cross was flicked on by McCulloch and Celtic  left-back Izaguirre managed to head the ball off the line and clear via  the underside of the crossbar.                             <br>                            Both sides were playing a 4-4-1-1 formation, with Weiss and  Paddy McCourt playing behind their respective strikers, and it was the  latter who almost proved to have the greater influence despite the more  evident trickery of the Slovakian.                             <br>                            The Northern Irishman&#39;s fine through ball into the penalty box  found James Forrest, who had come into the side along with Beram Kayal,  Charlie Mulgrew and Samaras, and forced a goal-saving tackle from  McCulloch.                             <br>                            It was now a more even contest with lone strikers Kenny Miller  and Samaras, whose inclusion meant that Anthony Stokes dropped to the  bench, being starved of ammunition as the half-time whistle blew.                             <br>                            Samaras set up the best chance of the match within seconds after  the break, his flicked header finding McCourt racing into the box, but  the winger fired his drive wide of the far post under pressure from  David Weir.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      Just as Rangers looked to have settled after early Celtic  pressure, the visitors took the lead after goalkeeper McGregor sold  himself after a long ball over the top of the defence from Joe Ledley  found Samaras.                             <br>                            Samaras flicked the ball past McGregor and rolled the ball into  the empty net and the Greek was soon celebrating a second.                             <br>                            The striker beat Ness for pace then was clipped by Bougherra&#39;s  lazy leg as he turned inside the Algeria defender before stepping up to  beat McGregor from the penalty spot.                             <br>                            Rangers, so subdued and reliant on aimless high balls until that  point, suddenly responded and Sasa Papac sent a low drive just wide of  the far post then Bougherra volleyed over from 16 yards.                             <br>                            However, Celtic held out comfortably - and came close again from  Ledley and Samaras - to leave Rangers requiring wins in their two games  in hand to overtake their rivals at the top of the Scottish Premier  League.                             </div>                              <div class="bo">                                           </div>                                          Story from BBC SPORT:<br> http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/9330644.stm<br> <br> Published: 2011/01/02 14:40:09 GMT<br><br><div class="headline"><h3>     Lennon hails &#39;unplayable&#39;

after the Greek striker scored both goals in their victory  over Rangers at Ibrox.                            </b>                            <br>                            &quot;Samaras was a constant menace,&quot; said Lennon. &quot;He was top drawer.                             <br>                            &quot;I thought he was a real handful. I thought he was unplayable from Rangers&#39; point of view.&quot;                             <br>                            Lennon is in his first full season as Celtic manager and he  said: &quot;This tops the lot to come here to play the champions and win  convincingly.&quot;                                            <div class="bo">                                                      The 2-0 win stretched Celtic&#39;s lead over their city rivals,  although Rangers have played fewer games because of recent postponements  because of wintry weather.                             <br>                            &quot;That&#39;s four points and it&#39;s a decent wee lead at the minute,&quot;  said Lennon. &quot;I know Rangers have two games in hand, but they are both  away and they have some hard games coming up.                 </div>                          <div class="ibox">                          <b>                            In the second half, we were much, much better than Rangers                            </b>                            <br>                            Celtic striker Georgios Samaras                                                      </div>              <div class="bo">                                                      &quot;But there&#39;s a lot of football to be played. Even if we had  lost, I still wouldn&#39;t have said the league was over, but the fact we  have won gives us a real chance.                             <br>                            &quot;I hope it is a turning point, but you never can tell. In the  end, I don&#39;t think Rangers caused us any problems whatsoever.&quot;                             <br>                            Celtic had gone into the game without suspended captain Scott  Brown, new signing Freddie Ljungberg and several other first-team  regulars.                             <br>                            &quot;It was a great performance considering I had nine out,&quot; said Lennon.                             <br>                            &quot;I think, once we got over the initial flurry of pressure, the two midfield boys got a grip of the game.                             <br>                            &quot;I thought the back four were magnificent all through the game and Samaras showed what he can do on any given day.&quot;                             <br>                            Lennon also praised Baram Kayal, who has had a long spell  missing through injury, and Charlie Mulgrew for their midfield roles  after recalls to the starting line-up.                             <br>                            &quot;They had one off the line early on, but then my goalkeeper did not have much to do after that,&quot; he said.                 </div>                              <div class="bo">                                                      &quot;People have been saying about myself and the team that we don&#39;t  win the big games, but we have done that today. You don&#39;t get much  bigger than that.                             <br>                            &quot;On the back of the three home draws, it was vital that we won.&quot;                             <br>                            Samaras had been preferred to Anthony Stokes, who dropped to the  bench, but the striker did not see his two goals as making a point to  the manager for being left on the bench previously.                             <br>                            &quot;The manager knows exactly what I can do and my qualities,&quot; said  the Greek. &quot;I feel really good myself that I scored two goals, but the  most important thing is the team and we are back on track.                             <br>                            &quot;I think it was a great performance from all the team. I think  the players worked really hard and I think in the end the best team won  the game.                             <br>                            &quot;In the second half, we were much, much better than Rangers.&quot;                             <br>                            Even so, Samaras thought the title race would go down the closing moments of the season.                             <br>                            &quot;We have three wins in a row,&quot; he said. &quot;But Rangers are a  really good team and, until the end of the season, it will be really  tight if we are to win the SPL trophy.&quot;                  </div>                  Story from BBC SPORT:<br> http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/pr/fr/-/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/9333600.stm<br> <br> Published: 2011/01/02 17:32:55 GMT<br> <br> &copy; BBC 2011<br> <br> &copy; BBC 2011<div class="matchLiveText collapsible">    <ul><li> Final Result </li><li> Full Time </li><li> 90:00+3:08  The final whistle is blown by the referee.        </li><li> 90:00+2:00  Shot by Georgios Samaras (Celtic) left-footed from left channel (12 yards), save (caught) by Allan McGregor (Rangers).

Celtic have not won at Ibrox in two years. They are without  eight players through injury and suspension. Possibly six of the eight  would have started today.</div>                       <div class="va-inlineleftnowrap"></div><br>Shorn  of Scott Brown, Shaun Maloney, Ki Sung Yueng and Olivier Kapo, they are  looking to plug the holes in their midfield with rusty talents. Baram  Kayal, Brown&#39;s likely replacement, has started one match since August.  Efrain Juarez has played one minute in six weeks. Freddie Ljungberg  hasn&#39;t played since October.<br><br>Up front, they are missing their  best goalscorer. Without Gary Hooper, the front two may be Anthony  Stokes, who hasn&#39;t scored in six games, and Georgios Samaras, who hasn&#39;t  scored in nine. The creative burden on Paddy McCourt is big and is  about to get bigger. <br><br>Of the likely squad, only two of them, Mark  Wilson and Samaras, know what it&#39;s like to get a victory in Rangers&#39;  back yard. So when you add it all together and factor in Rangers&#39;  relative clean bill of health, Celtic&#39;s chances don&#39;t amount to a great  deal. The bookmakers have them as 3-1  outsiders, which seems about  right.<br><br>Celtic&#39;s only hope is that they come out full of  controlled aggression at being written off. Of course, they will have  three men who would have relished such a scenario in their own day, who  would have soaked up the the doubtful words of the press and used them  as inspiration. Neil Lennon, Johan Mjallby and Alan Thompson became  Celtic greats on the back of days like this, days when everybody said  they couldn&#39;t deliver, but did. It was instructive to hear Lennon say  &quot;no excuses&quot; on Friday when asked about his lengthy list of absentees.  &quot;No excuses&quot; was a phrase he used a number of times.<br><br>There was  never any doubting his own mental strength, but what of the team he has  created? &quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do about those eight being out,&quot; he  said. &quot;We&#39;ll certainly miss Brown. He was excellent the other night  (against Motherwell] and very unfortunate. But there will be no excuses  come Sunday. We&#39;ve a squad deep enough to cope and we have coped with  big players being out already this season. Hooper was out for a lengthy  time, Maloney has been out and now Ki and Cha.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s not a  defining game by any means because we&#39;re only halfway through the  season, but psychologically it would give the players a huge boost to  come out with a result. Myself, Johan and Alan will speak to the  players, but it&#39;s difficult to replicate the experience of actually  going out there. It&#39;s a great venue and a great fixture and my own  personal experiences there were very good. I really enjoyed playing  there. I hope the players take that on board and relish it.</div>                                                                                                                                                                                                           That&#39;s why we brought them here and that&#39;s why they came.&quot;<br><br>The  lack of experience of this fixture among those left standing is  something that has to be troubling Lennon greatly.

The rest of the defence, and  the goalkeeper, have only one appearance each against Rangers. None of  those four have played at Ibrox. Neither, for that matter, have Joe  Ledley, Kayal, Juarez and Niall McGinn. <br><br>The danger for Lennon is  that he overdoes the big psyche-up and sends them with out their hair  on fire, as was the case when Stokes almost got himself sent off in the  opening seconds of the Old Firm game earlier in the season. &quot;It&#39;s  important to strike a balance before the game,&quot; said the manager. <br><br>&quot;I  don&#39;t talk to them too much. We just try and give them bullet points if  we can. We don&#39;t want them to get too fired up. The important thing for  us will be discipline - we want to keep 11 players on the pitch. A lack  of experience can possibly make that a greater danger. Alan (Thompson]  is probably the last person to be giving players advice for staying on  the pitch. (Thompson was sent off three times at Ibrox]. Myself and  Johan will have to talk to them and tell them to keep their head and  focus. We&#39;ll tell them to just concentrate on the game and get lost in  the game. You can do that. You can zone out and block out the crowd. If  you prepare yourself well you can do that no problem. We&#39;ve fallen short  in these games so far so that&#39;s an incentive for us to go and get a  performance and result and see the bad moments out which we probably  haven&#39;t done in previous games.<br><br>&quot;We&#39;ll go over the last one again  and we&#39;ll look at recent footage of Rangers. But it (losing the head]  happens to us all. I did it myself the first time I was at Wembley with  Crewe (in 1993] when we played in the play-off final. I just completely  forgot about the game, let the occasion get to me and I was hopeless  that day. I thought if I ever get the chance to go back and do that  again I would play the game rather than all the razzmatazz that goes  with it.&quot;<br><br>For Celtic, the glitz from the off will have to be  provided by McCourt for it doesn&#39;t appear as if Ljungberg is going to  start the game and elswhere that little bit of flair is absent in this  Celtic team.<br><br>Lennon eulogised the Irishman on Friday once again,  praising his passing and his vision, his movement and his ability to  &quot;find a weakness in someone and exploit it. He knows he didn&#39;t cover  himself in glory when he came on as a sub in the last Old Firm game so  he&#39;s another who&#39;ll want to rectify that and prove he can play in these  high-intensity matches&quot;. <br><br>Finally, Lennon&#39;s great hope for the  day, that something special drops out of the Glasgow sky when nobody is  quite expecting it. &quot;The injuries to big players should galvanise the  team,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;At Leicester we used to go to places like Liverpool down to the bare bones, but we&#39;d get a result.<br><br>&quot;Sometimes  you get a surprise package. There could be a player who produces a  performance and you think: &#39;Where did that come from?&#39; Then they kick on  from there.&quot;<br><br>Truly this would be the most improbable victory were they to pull it off.</div>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>The following is a disgrace and a sick nonsense<br><br><a class="external" href="http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/columnists/billleckiesports/3327274/Take-your-medicine.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scot...-medicine.html</a><br><h3>GEORGIOS SAMARAS spent Christmas in his sickbed.</h3>Bill Leckie <br>Freddie Ljungberg missed his debut with the sniffles.<br><br>And their fans even took a coughing fit during the minute&#39;s silence.<br><br>No wonder Neil Lennon looked like he needed a Lemsip and a lie down as time ticked down to the game many reckoned could make or break him.<br><br>But there&#39;s no tonic on earth like a win.<br><br>No medicine like seeing your team sweat it out to get their job done.<br><br>No hangover cure for the punters like seeing the league table this morning.<br><br>If they&#39;re honest, they must have feared the worst. Injuries, illness and international call-ups had left them nine men short.<br><br>The team Lennon picked seemed as thin as a one-ply tissue.<br><br>Yet in the end, it was Rangers who caught a cold. It was Gers who went home spluttering.<br><br>They ran out of ideas faster than a sneeze escapes your hooter.<br><br>The longer it went on, the more mistakes spread through their ranks like a virus.<br><br>Twice they had possession in dangerous areas deep in Celtic territory. Twice they ended up picking the ball out of their own net.<br><br>Long before the end, they looked around themselves and wondered where the draught was coming from.<br><br>Then they realised it was the doors being booted open as fed-up punters decided they&#39;d had enough.<br><br>There&#39;s surely no worse feeling on these days of ***-for-tat gloating than seeing the other lot celebrate on your patch.<br><br>Back in October, it was the Celtic hordes who had to put up with it after their players were run out of it in a one-sided second half.<br><br>Now, the tables were turned.<br><br>And the Bluenoses masses weren&#39;t hanging about to see the Broomloan Stand party.<br><br>They could be waking up this morning two points clear the top with two games in hand. Instead, you doubt if they fancy emerging from under the duvet.<br><br>It was a strange afternoon, one where the usual poison mingled in the chill air with the raw emotion of remembrance. Where Celtic had made a big show of keeping out a rabble-rousing element of their support but when the cops let others smuggle in smoke bombs and one guy even got through the turnstiles in a Pope costume.<br><br>And where the ultra-moronic found a surreal way to try and screw up a tribute to the 66 lives lost in the 1971 Ibrox Disaster.<br><br>As the stadium fell still on ref Craig Thomson&#39;s whistle, a cough came from the Celtic End. Then another. Then another and another and lots more anothers until it was as clear as the red nose on a flu-ridden reindeer&#39;s face that this was an orchestrated effort to make a point.<br><br>What that point was, we&#39;ll never know. But it seems some lame-brains just don&#39;t have the civility to shut the hell up for 60 seconds in memory of others.<br><br>As the seconds ticked painfully slowly, someone in the middle of the away support started to applaud.<br><br>To the credit of others around him, he was quickly and quietly shut up.<br><br>So, with the minute&#39;s silence at an end, we settled down for 90 minutes of tedium.<br><br>Because, boy, it was a duff game.<br><br>There were times when you couldn&#39;t have trusted either side to pass the salt at the dinner table, never mind move a ball ten yards to a team-mate.<br><br>Here were 50,000 fans, paying fortunes for the privilege of a seat, waiting in vain for someone to have even a quarter-decent effort on goal.<br><br>Worst of all, here were two teams taking part in what&#39;s meant to be the most passionate derby on the planet, laying less of a glove on each other than Audrey Harrison had on the boy David Haye.<br><br>I&#39;ve said it many times and it&#39;s worth repeating. Take away the insanity and Old Firm games have become some of most mind-numbing of the season.<br><br>Though &#39;who cares?&#39; chorus Celtic men in loud unison.<br><br>What they saw was a patchwork side repelling whatever Rangers could throw at them - however little that was - before slowly but surely imposing themselves on the game.<br><br>Young winger James Forrest should have scored from Paddy McCourt&#39;s cunning reverse pass in the first half, but hesitated and was ploughed by Lee McCulloch.<br><br>McCourt himself then ran clear 56 seconds after the break, but dragged his shot across the goal and wide.<br><br>By the hour, it was becoming hard to see where a home goal was coming from. Though that didn&#39;t make it any less surprising to see an away one.<br><br>Ricky Foster had any number of options to choose from as he cut inside from right-back, 20 yards inside the opposition half.<br><br>Passing straight to Joe Ledley shouldn&#39;t have been one of them - and in an instant, the Welshman released Samaras, who skipped past Allan McGregor as the keeper needlessly raced 30 yards from goal and rolled the ball into an empty net.<br><br>Ledley ran and leapt into his manager&#39;s arms. Samaras went into the crowd behind the goal. Some of the crowd behind the goal tried to get on the park.<br><br>Rangers stood like statues, frozen by their own stupidity.<br><br>They never defrosted again.<br><br>Eight minutes later, with 20 to go, they had options again when Celtic only half-cleared a corner - yet once again they lost the ball and once again Samaras was away.<br><br>This time, he was wide on the right. He looked up and saw no support, so held and held until he saw a ***** of light between young midfielder Jamie Ness and defender Madjid Bougherra.<br><br>The Algerian hung out a leg. The Greek went over it.<br><br>The whistler pointed to the spot.<br><br>Done and dusted.<br><br>A Celtic team who had come with hope rather than expectation were swaggering like champions. A striker left to graft away on his own had found an endless supply of pals.<br><br>From the away end, up went chorus after chorus of the 80s classic Just Can&#39;t Get Enough.<br><br>But the rest of Ibrox had already seen way too much.<br><br><br>Read more: <a class="external" href="http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/columnists/billleckiesports/3327274/Take-your-medicine.html#ixzz19ynT9hL5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scot...#ixzz19ynT9hL5</a><br><br>Pasted from &lt;<a class="external" href="http://www.footballforums.net/forums/showthread.php/269514-Hurting-Bitter-Bastards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.footballforums.net/forums/showthread.php/269514-Hurting-Bitter-Bastards</a>&gt;</div></div>
