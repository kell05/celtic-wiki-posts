Season 1895-96 was special with Celtic conceding just 25 goals in the league, 13 less than second placed Rangers which highlighted the quality of the defence (at a time when the defence was 1-2 men plus the goalkeeper and not 4-5 players as now). A 6-2 victory over Rangers at end-1895 in particular effectively sealed Celtic&#39;s league title.</div><div><br>Partnering the popular and dashing Dan Doyle in defence, they both were a highly regarded defensive pair, and winning the Glasgow Cup final v Queen&#39;s Park in Nov 1895 at Ibrox helped to cement the 1895-96 season as a big success.</div><div><br>However, his Celtic career ended in controversial fashion the next season.<br><br>After the press criticised the Celtic team in the wake of a Glasgow Cup final defeat to Rangers in November 1896, Meehan and other players refused to play in the next match at home to Hibs unless the press men were kicked out the ground. <br><br>In the wake of that action, Celtic suspended three Celtic players, and Meehan was sold in January to Everton after making 25 league appearances for Celtic and scoring one goal. <br><br>In retrospect, a shame as well, as Celtic had only lost one game in which he had played in that season to that point. Following his dropping from the first team, Celtic lost three league games and drew one; Celtic went on to lose the league by 4pts (2pts for a win back then), and slip to fourth in the league after being the champions the seasons before.<span class="diffAdd"> Did the board cut off their nose to spite their face?</span><br><br>His one goal for Celtic came against Dundee in an 11-0 victory in the league in Oct 1895, a record victory for Celtic in the league that <span class="diffRemove">stands</span><span class="diffAdd">still</span> <span class="diffRemove">to</span><span class="diffAdd">stands</span> at time of writing.<br><br>Some would argue his best days were at Sunderland and not the Celts, but he had a very good record at Celtic, and likely had more to show.  You could well argue that the loss of Meehan, Battles and Divers after that &#39;strike&#39; cost Celtic the league title in 1896-97, after which Meehan could have become as highly celebrated as other great figures from that era.<br><br>He played across a number of clubs after Celtic: Everton, Southampton, Man City, Barrow, Broxburn, Clyde &amp; Broxburn Shamrock. He was an FA Cup finalist with Everton and Southampton following his time at Celtic but his side lost both finals.</div><div></div><div><br>After football, he migrated to Canada to Nova Scotia, and returned to mining.</div><div><br>He sadly passed away in 1915 prematurely at the age of 43, attributed to appendicitis or pneumonia brought about after spending a night in the snow looking for a nephew who had gone missing. <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career </h3>  <div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">SCOTTISH CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">LEAGUE CUP</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">EUROPE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#333333">TOTAL</font></b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1892-1897</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">25</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  25</td></tr>  <tr>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <font color="#333333">Goals</font></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">1</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  1</td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>Scottish League</b>   <br><ul><li><a href="/page/1896" target="_self"><font size="2">1895-96</font></a><br></li></ul><b>Charity Cup</b><br><ul><li><a href="/page/1896" target="_self"><font size="2">1896</font></a><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Pictures</h3>  <ul>  <li>  <a href="/page/Meehan%2C+Peter+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li>  </ul>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>  <h3>From The West Lothian Courier 21st January 2010</h3><br><h3>The Broxburn footballer who swapped shale pits for silverware</h3>Jan 21 2010 by Eric MacKinnon, West Lothian Courier <br><br><h3>Peter Meechan</h3><br>The Courier takes a look back at the colourful, and often controversial, career of West Lothian&rsquo;s unsung footballing hero, former Celtic and Hibs star Peter Meechan<br><br>PETER MEECHAN swapped the shale pits of West Lothian for a starring role on British football&rsquo;s grandest stages, winning the top titles in Scotland and England while also earning a full Scotland cap and playing in two FA Cup finals.<br><br>The Broxburn-born star was a transfer record breaker and Meechan (sometimes incorrectly spelled Meehan) is one of West Lothian&rsquo;s most successful football exports and a former favourite at Glasgow Celtic.<br><br>But little has been written of a player who must have been one of the first from the area to have earned championship medals on both sides of the border.<br><br>Peter was born on February 28, 1872, to James and Ann Meechan, who had left Donegal, Ireland in 1858.<br><br>The census of 1891 shows that 19-year-old Peter was living at home with his Gaelic -speaking parents and 15-year-old sister Annie in a two-room house at Stewartfield Row in Broxburn.<br><br>He, like his father, listed his occupation as a shale miner and the census also shows the family spelling of their name was indeed Meechan, confirming the family name which has been spelt in many different ways at each of the clubs he played for and by his descendants in Nova Scotia.<br><br>Peter showed an early flair for football and quickly made a name for himself on the pitch.<br><br>The opening whistle on the reliable right--back&rsquo;s career sounded on the local parks of his hometown with Broxburn Emmett.<br><br>Broxburn was then a thriving mining town and the working men helped fill the starting line-ups of several different clubs dotted around the area &mdash; including four senior sides.<br><br>Broxburn Shamrock were the most successful local club at the time and had forged an impressive Scottish Cup pedigree, taking cup-holders Hearts all the way in an epic 5-4 sixth-round defeat in December 1891.<br><br>But Meechan, who had risen to the role of Shamrock captain, sat the game &ndash; played at Shamrock Park, then-located on Pyothall Road in the town &ndash; out due to a monetary dispute with his club.<br>The sports pages of this very newspaper reported the following in December 1891.<br><br>&ldquo;The Scottish Cup holders Hearts had their full team out, while Shamrock were minus their captain Meechan at the back.<br><br>&ldquo;Various rumours were afloat as the cause of the home captains absence from the team.<br><br>&ldquo;Some newspapers attribute it to a dispute with the committee over &lsquo;terms&rsquo;, while another puts it down to that he was disappointed at the size of a subscription raised for him during the time he was off work.&rdquo;<br><br>It was the first incident of controversy in his fledgling career but it would certainly not be his last, as the annals of history show Meechan was a man unafraid to take a stand for what he believed was right.<br><br>Following this incident, Meechan made a short-term switch to another local club &mdash;
