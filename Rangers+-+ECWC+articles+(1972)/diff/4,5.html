One official said his Government were angered by &ldquo;the behaviour of thousands of drunken Scottish spectators&rdquo; and the coverage of the riot in Camp Nou by<i> </i>at least four British daily newspapers and the BBC. There was anger at alleged anti-Spanish bias in the reports. However, Spanish sources say there was<b> </b>unlikely to be any formal protest or further Government action.<br><br><font size="4"><b>Arrests</b></font><br><br>The Foreign Office said the Consul-General in Barcelona, Mr H. Kennedy, had reported to London the names of eight British citizens arrested by the police after the breaking up of a bar before the match. Their names were not being released until next of kin had been informed.<br><br>Meanwhile in Barcelona the Spanish police and the British Consul were last night counting the<b> </b>cost of the riot and its after&shy;math. So<b> </b>far the British Consulate, have<b> </b>paid out &pound;1300 to repatriate fans.<br><br>Damage amounting to &pound;12,000 was<b> </b>caused in the stadium, which is owned by Barcelona<b> </b>Football Club, and last night eight Rangers<b> </b>supporters of a total of 97 arrested were still in jails in the city.<br><br><font size="4"><b>Policemen hurt</b></font><br><br>Two supporters are seri&shy;ously ill in hospital. About 120 fans and 33 Spanish policemen were treated for injuries after the riot. <br><br>On the team&rsquo;s return to Glasgow last night Mr John Lawrence, chairman of Rangers, said the incidents after the match followed the kindness of the police in allowing supporters on to the pitch before the game.<br><br>He said he told the chief constable of Barcelona though an interpreter that it was unfortunate that, in kindness, the police allowed fans on to the ground before the tie.<br><br>&quot;I told him that I felt the unfortunate circumstances arose from the fact that two minutes from the end of the game the referee gave a foul and went to pick up the ball,&quot; Mr Lawrence added, &ldquo;Our people thought this was the finish of the game and ran on to the field.&rdquo;<br><br><font size="4"><b>Fans blamed</b></font><br><br>Mr Agustion Montal, pre&shy;sident of Barcelona Football club, said:--&ldquo;I am not blaming Rangers football club, but I am blaming their fans. <br><br>&ldquo;I would suggest that as a peacemaking gesture Rangers should come back to Barcelona to play a friendly match, with the proceeds going towards repairing the damage.&rdquo;<br><br>One man who was reported to have died from a heart attack during the riot at the stadium turned up at the British consulate&hellip;<br><br>(Continued on Back Page)<br><br><font size="4"><b>Spanish protest over fans</b></font><br>(Continued from Page 1)<br>&hellip;to report that he was alive and well.<br><br>The spectator, a Spaniard of British origin, said he had fainted during the riot while trying to restrain a boisterous young Scot. He recovered soon afterwards.<br><br>In the Costa Brava resort of Lloret, 11 persons were detained and at Calella nearby 14 others were rounded up by police. All were understood to have been released.<br><br>In another resort, Mataro, about 90 fans &ldquo;ran amok&rdquo; according to the manager of their hotel. They were evicted.<br><br>A spokesman for the hotel said:--&ldquo;We never want clients like these again. They caused wilful damage, they stole, wrecked the building, and insulted staff and other guests.&rdquo;<br><br>Mr Ian Bradley, the British Vice-Consul in Barcelona, said that 49 Rangers supporters had been helped financially to make their way home.<br><br><font size="4"><b>In hospital</b></font><br><br>The two supporters still in hospital are Mr Alan Ritchie, of 12 Dudley Drive, Hyndland, Glasgow who fractured his skull when he fell from a balcony at the Victoria Hotel, in Calella earlier this week, and Mr John Fyfe, of Glasgow (whose address is still unknown), who was knocked down in Barcelona by a motor cyclist.<br><br>Mr Ritchie whose mother was flown from Glasgow to be at her son&rsquo;s bedside, was stated last night to be improving in San Pablo Hospital. Mr Fyfe is said to be fairly comfortable. He is not seriously injured.<br><br>Moscow Dynamo officials are lodging a protest, claiming that some of their players were injured when the Rangers supporters ran on to the pitch three minutes from the end.<br><br>The Soviet Football Federation have sent a telegram to the European Football Union in Switzerland supporting Moscow Dynamo&rsquo;s call for a replay of the final. A similar telegram was sent to the International Football Federation (FIFA).<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>(Editorial Comment, Page <span class="diffRemove">12)BARCELONA</span><span class="diffAdd">12)</span></h3><font size="5"><span class="diffAdd">BARCELONA</span><span class="diffFormatting" title=""> SHAME</span></font><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">WINNING a European football trophy should, be an occasion for moderate rejoicing and</span><b><span class="diffFormatting" title=""> </span></b><span class="diffFormatting" title="">not a time of bitter recriminations that extend far beyond the confines of the football world. Sadly, the hooligan element among Rangers Football Club sup&shy;porters have not seen it that way. The damage done to the standing not just of Glasgow but of Scotland by the disgraceful behaviour of thousands of rioting Rangers&#39; supporters in Barcelona can only be guessed at. It seems likely, however, that every harmful stereotype of Glasgow and her population &mdash; the alleged undercurrent of violence, the drinking, and the hooliganism&mdash;will be firmly reinforced in the minds of people not merely south of the Border but on the Continent as well. How many Glaswegians on holiday out of Scotland this year will now face a cautious welcome once their home town becomes known? Hooliganism rubs off. As a result of the Barcelona debacle potential investors might think twice before choosing to set up in Scotland. And who would blame them? Glasgow&#39;s recently appointed public relations officer has a lot of damage to repair. Football supporters abroad must realise that they are doing more than representing their team. They are taken to be representative of their country.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><div><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  Before anyone attempts to heap the blame on the Spanish police for their undoubtedly tough handling of the situation it should not be overlooked that the trouble began long before the inexcusable invasion of the playing field during the course of the match and the rioting afterwards. Hotels and other property were vandalised and the behaviour of some supporters caused understandable apprehension among the locals, their police, and probably the Russian team once they had entered the stadium. The followers were given ample warning that they could expect no latitude from the Spanish police if they misbehaved. What action the Union of European Football Associations take is of course their concern, but if Rangers FC are disciplined or ordered to replay the final with Moscow Dynamo a por&shy;tion of their supporters will bear the burden of responsibility. </span></div><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Glasgow Herald (Front page) Friday 26 May 1972</span><br><br><font size="4"><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Disgrace to club &ndash; Mains </span></b></font><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Mr John Mains, Lord Provost of Glasgow, yesterday described the behaviour of Rangers fans as &quot;shameful and disgraceful.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;I think it was a wonder&shy;ful victory and a wonderful evening for Rangers Football dub,&quot; Mr Mains said, &quot;That should not be for&shy;gotten. After all, the</span><i><span class="diffFormatting" title=""> </span></i><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Rangers directors, the foot&shy;ball club, and the team are not responsible for the irresponsible behaviour of some of the supporters.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&quot;It is shameful and disgraceful that men should act in this way and bring disgrace to the name of an honourable club in their hour of triumph. It is most unfortunate.&rdquo; The Lord Provost was at Prestwick Airport last night to welcome the Rangers team. He hopes to organise a joint civic reception later this year for Rangers and for Celtic, Scottish League champions for the seventh year in succession.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  </span><div><span class="diffFormatting" title="">  Referring to the actions of the Spanish police, Mr. Main said:-&ldquo;I would not like to criticise when I was not there to see what happened.&rdquo;</span><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Glasgow Herald, Friday 26 May 1972</span></h3><br></div><font size="4"><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="">UEFA hold Rangers responsible for spectator violence</span></b></font><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">By Jim Parkinson</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">European Football Union officials are holding Rangers responsible for the shambles and violence that took the shine off the Glasgow club&rsquo;s triumph against Moscow Dynamo in the European Cup-winners&rsquo; Cup Final in Barcelona on Wednesday.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">When the union&rsquo;s disciplinary committee meet in several weeks&rsquo; time to hear the facts of the pitched battles between the police and spectators at the Camp Nou Stadium, Rangers will not just be on trial. They have been prejudged, and the meeting is sure to decide on drastic punishment. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Consequences could be far-reaching &ndash; with disqualification from Europe next season as the most likely decision. The alternatives are for the union (UEFA) to withdraw the trophy, which would probably still mean exclusion from the tournament as the winners are automatic entrants, or to impose a massive monetary fine.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">No matter how much the Ibrox club protest their innocence &ndash;and they are right to do so&mdash;UEFA will condemn them for the irresponsible mob-rule of the hooligans Rangers themselves would truly love to be rid of. </span><br><br><b><font size="4"><span class="diffFormatting" title="">REPUTATION</span></font><br><br></b><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Willie Waddell said those unwanted fans could &ldquo;crucify the club&rdquo; and yet he will resist official pressure to take sanctions against them. But the Europeans are equally adamant and livid that reputable football has been badly stained.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Mr Hans Bangerter, UEFA&rsquo;s secretary-general told me yesterday morning: -- &ldquo;Action will be taken against Rangers. The club must bear the consequences, absolutely, absolutely.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">&ldquo;They are totally responsible for the conduct of their supporters. We can never permit such terrible events to happen again in our sport. Football has been dragged into disrepute. The scenes were the most disgraceful I have ever seen in Europe. They were unbelievable. In fact I have never experienced anything like them anywhere in the world--no, not even in South America. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">These people have shamed our sport, our Spanish hosts, and, worst of all, millions of television viewers were witness to it.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Mr Bangerter, who preaches constantly about unsporting conduct and misbehaviour, went on:--&ldquo;The referee would have been perfectly correct in stopping the play altogether after the previous dreadful occurrences during the game. We cannot allow this type of misconduct to go unpunished.&rdquo; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">When I put Rangers&rsquo; view to him that they were not party to the organisation of the game and security was surely the responsibility of the UEFA and the Catalan FA, he retorted:--&ldquo;Our rule is perfectly clear. This specifies that each club accepts responsibility for its followers. It is a serious thing for Rangers, and of course it is serious too for Scottish football.&rdquo; </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">It may be the end of next month before Rangers&rsquo;s penalty is decided. UEFA officials are committed with next week&rsquo;s European Cup final and then a series of conferences, but once all the reports are received on the game, the disciplinary committee will announce their findings.</span><br><br><font size="4"><b><span class="diffFormatting" title="">CLUB&rsquo;S PRIDE</span></b></font><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Rangers&rsquo;, however, do not regard themselves as anything else but outright winners. Willie Waddell, the team manager said:--&ldquo;We won all right. How can anyone say that we did not earn that trophy on the field? We were presented with the trophy and everyone in the Rangers club is proud to have it in their possession.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Mr Bangerter does not think that UEFA have been compromised by the fact that they handed over the trophy to Rangers&rsquo;s captain, John Greig, in a dressing room deep under the stand and away from the riot between incensed supporters and gun-pointing, baton-swinging police. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">He explained:--&ldquo;The trophy was handed over, but at the time we were not aware of the full extent of the violence. Mr Gustav Wiederkher (the UEFA President) and myself were in the tunnel underneath the track waiting to go on to the pitch for the presentation, but because of the invasion of the field we had to change our arrangements. It has been a most serious and regrettable affair.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">It is sorrowful that the mass of supporters who had gone so far to share the joy of winning the cup should be tagged with those who had created all the trouble. Some young fans who were clearly well behaved appealed to me to help get them out of the main gate and save them from the sticks being wielded somewhat indiscriminately by the police. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">There is no doubt it is about time the cancerous evil of the hooligan is eliminated, not only from the Rangers&rsquo;s support but from Scottish football in general. As our prestige soars at club and International level on the field, our stock is plunging crazily by this disease on the terracing.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">A single beer can caused UEFA to take drastic measures after it had been thrown at an Italian player by a German team supporter earlier this season. A replay was ordered because of it. One can be certain that the European body will wish to make a bigger example after the latest trouble.</span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Ortiz de Mendibil, the Barcelona referee had no trouble from the players apart from booking John Greig and Alex MacDonald. As this was the second time they had been officially cautioned in the competition they stand to be banned from the first round next year&mdash;if Rangers are allowed automatic entry as the holders. </span><br><br><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Rangers&rsquo; players, however, were relieved from tension of the last few days when they were saluted by the home fans at Ibrox last night. Afterwards they dispersed and a long gruelling season is now over for them, and they will not report back for serious work until mid-July. </span><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><span class="diffFormatting" title="">Front page, Glasgow Herald, Thursday 25 May, 1972</span></h3><br><font size="5"><b>Spanish police in baton charge after fans invade pitch</b></font><br><br>From Charles Gillies in Barcelona<br><br><b>Spanish policemen with guns drawn and wielding batons charged thousands of Rangers supporters who invaded the pitch at the end of the European Cup-winners&#39; Cup match against Moscow Dynamo last night.</b> <br><br>Fighting broke out with the police after an<i> </i>estimated 10,000 fans swarmed on to the pitch in Camp Nou Stadium, Barcelona, to congratulate the Rangers players on their 3-2 win over the Russians.<br><br>Mr Willie Waddell, Rangers manager, said later: &mdash; &quot;The behaviour of the fans places our whole future in Europe at risk.&quot;<br><br>Mr Waddell said, however, that he was still proud of the support the team had received.<br><br>Journalist watching the scenes believed that there would have been no trouble if the police had not charged.<br><br><font size="4"><b>FINAL WHISTLE</b></font><br><br>Trouble broke out about 90 seconds from the end of the match when Rangers supporters believing that the final whistle had gone invaded the pitch.<br><br>Mr Waddell, police and European football officials also ran on to the field telling the supporters to return to the terracing. Play was delayed for several minutes.<br><br>At the end of the match however, even more fans ran on to the field, mobbing players and Mr Waddell. Police fought unsuccessfully to contain them as<b> </b>hundreds of cushions and other missiles were thrown from the terracing.<br><br>About 10,000 Rangers supporters thronged the middle of the field waving flags and banners. Then the scene turned ugly.<br><br>Police drew guns and made a baton charge. Fighting broke out. Supporters fled in disarray and policemen stormed into the crowd.<br><br>Five minutes after full time the centre of the park was ringed by police, and opposite the stand another section of the Rangers following rushed on to the grass.<br> <br>Police replied with<b><i> </i></b>another charge. A pitched battle followed, and as one supporter was led away other fans attacked the police.<br><br>One man was clubbed by several policemen, and this brought a hail of missiles from other fans. The fighting continued for more than 10 minutes. Outside the players dressing-rooms at least 50 Rangers fans formed a guard against the police.<br><br><font size="4"><b>CASUALTIES</b></font><br><br>More than 50 people were led away with head injuries as police began throwing batons into the crowd. <br><br>The park became littered with cushions, oranges, papers and other articles as ambulance men ran all over the grass dealing with casualties. <br><br>Earlier the crowd had been, for the most part, good-natured. The noise in the stadium was deafening.<br><br>Moscow Dynamo appeared to have no support and most of the 30,000 crowd appeared to be supporting Rangers. The Rangers fans blew horns and trumpets and kept up a constant din of support for their team. <br><br>Journalists watching the scenes at the end of the<i> </i>match thought that the police had over-reacted to the invasion of the field. <br><br>The baton charge certainly appeared to be a premature move against supporters who seemed merely to want to congratulate the team, if in<i> </i>a noisy manner.<br><br>There was still no trouble<i> </i>as the fans mobbed the players&mdash;exuberance but no hooliganism. It<i> </i>was not until several were struck by batons that the rioting began.<br><br><font size="4"><b>GANG SLOGANS</b></font><br><br>Not all the Rangers fans saw the game, despite their long journey from Glasgow. In Calella, about 35 miles from Barcelona, the walls of hotels were sprayed with gang slogans from aerosol sprays, and 19 supporters were arrested.<br><br>Twelve of them were released after paying a nominal fine, but seven were still in<i> </i>custody last night. <br><br>Many left Calella to seek other accommodation in Barcelona because of drunken sprees by some Rangers followers.<br><br>One said&mdash;&ldquo;We could not live there any longer. The fans were going berserk, smashing everything within sight and using their spray guns wherever they saw a wall.&rdquo;<br><br>One supporter, Mr Alan Norman Ritchie, aged 20, of 12 Dudley Drive, Hyndland, Glasgow was still in San Pablo Hospital, Barcelona last night after having fallen from a balcony in the Victoria Hotel.<br><br>His mother flew from Glasgow yesterday to be at<i> </i>his bedside. Hospital officials said Mr Ritchie was &quot;still critically ill, but recovering.&rdquo;<br><br><font size="4"><b>REPLAY CLAIM</b></font><br><br>After the game there was sporadic fighting outside the stadium<b> </b>between police and Rangers supporters. The chief constable of Barcelona said late last night that he did not know how many people had been arrested.<br><br>The Russians are now claiming a replay. Mr Konstantin Beskov, senior coach of Moscow Dynamo, said that some of their players had to &ldquo;dive for their lives&rdquo; when the Rangers fans invaded the pitch.<br>There should be another game, he said.<br><br>Mr Willie Waddell the Rangers manager reacted strongly to the news that the Russians have protested and demanded a replay.<br><br>He said:&mdash;&ldquo;Rangers Football Club refuse absolutely to take any responsibility for what happened in that stadium. The game was organised by EUFA and crowd control was in their hands completely. If their arrangements were inadequate then that is their responsibility.&rdquo;<br>(See Page 4)<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Glasgow Herald Thursday 25 May, 1972 (Page 4)</h3><br><font size="5"><b>Rangers&rsquo; first European triumph marred by spectator invasions</b></font><br><br>By Jim Parkinson<br><br>Rangers found their rainbow&rsquo;s end at the Camp Nou Stadium here tonight when they beat Russia&#39;s football masters, Moscow Dynamo and won the European Cup-Winners&rsquo;<b> </b>Cup for the first time.<br><br>Rangers&#39; future in Europe,<i> </i>however, may have been jeopardised by hostility that marred a night that should have rated as their finest hour. <br><br>Intermittent invasions of the field had earlier threat&shy;ened to have the game abandoned. Then only a minute from time the most highly excited contingent among the 20,000 plus Rangers supporters impati&shy;ently anticipated the end and rushed on to the field. They just could not wait for their moment of glory and thus endangered the efforts of a team who had played magnificently in<i> </i>the first 50 minutes to build a three-goal lead and then spent the rest of the match trying desperately to hold it. <br><br>After the match Konstantin Beskov, Dynamo&rsquo;s senior coach appealed to the European Football Union to have the game replayed. He claimed that his players were intimidated by the Rangers&rsquo; supporters who spilled onto the pitch before play had ended.<br><br>As he complained angrily and bitterly he said: -- &ldquo;Some of our players had to dive for their lives, and were injured. It robbed us of a possible equalising goal.&rdquo;<br><br><font size="4"><b>PITCHED BATTLE </b></font><br><br>Rangers succeeded ner&shy;vously, but those earlier invasions must have done a lot to break the players&#39; concentration. It should never have happened when everything was going so well. The players, highly tense, and Willie Waddell, their manager, did not deserve to have it all marred by the pitched battle between police and spectators after the last break-in.<br><br>The Ibrox players were not even accorded the honours of having the trophy presented to them with the medals on the field. This was done somewhat shamefully in an underground dressing-room.<br><br>The ugly scenes over&shy;shadowed the real merit of the triumph. Rangers had conditioned themselves for the match, and it was proved in<i> </i>the first half that they intended to wrap it up early.<br><br>It appeared as though they had done so until after the third goal the Russians brought on a substitute, Eschtrekov for Jakubik. It transformed the Russians as the replacement scored a goal almost immediately and that sparked off a Dynamo revival.<br><br>When the game swung, Rangers had a giant in defence in Peter McCloy. The giant 6ft. 4in. goalkeeper was brilliant in defying the methodical Dynamo players when they reproduced the football expected of such a world-class club.<br><br>Rangers were just that shade better over the game. When they were attacking they had Dave Smith conducting the play in remarkably stylish fashion from deep in defence. It was his precise passes that led to the first two goals.<br><br>Rangers at that time had plenty of front runners. McLean trickily threaded his way past big Russian defenders bemused by his acceleration and footwork. He had a willing partner in Colin Stein and Willie Johnston on the other wing kept his rivals well occupied.<br><br>It was McLean who threatened to scheme the first goal, but when it did come in 24 minutes, it was from that uncanny man, Smith. From the middle of his own half he prodded the ball forward for Colin Stein to run on to just at the edge of the penalty box, and the centre forward hit a fierce drive past Pilgul.<br><br>Smith ventured much further downfield five minutes before the interval to set up the second goal. With the Russians retreating before him and funnelling desperately into the penalty area, Smith chipped the ball over on to the head of Willie Johnston, who flicked it into the net.<br><br>Rangers&rsquo; confidence increased three minutes after the interval when Stein took the brunt of a challenge from two Russians to get to a high ball. It spun off to<b> </b>Willie Johnston,<b> </b>who stroked it in. <br> <br><font size="4"><b>ENCOURAGEMENT </b></font><br><br>Then the Russians made the switch that almost swung the match their way. Rangers had to pull more and more men back after Eschtrekov had reduced the deficit in 59 minutes, but they were magnificently encouraged by the supporters who paradoxically have put the club&rsquo;s European future at risk. <br><br>In the cliff-hanging finish, Smith kicked off the line, Jardine almost scored an own-goal and with five minutes to go Mahovikov scored Dynamo&rsquo;s second goal.<br><br><b>RANGERS</b>&mdash;McCloy; Jardine and Mathieson; Greig, D.
