He played right-half in that tie but would soon be switched to inside left where he formed an excellent partnership with Billy McPhail.<br><br>An inventive player capable of creating and scoring goals he seemed to have found the perfect foil in McPhail. Sammy and Billy both netted in a 3-2 victory over Rangers on September 21st as Celtic claimed there first league victory at Ibrox for 22 years. <br><br>With McPhail beside him Wilson was a constant menace to defenders and on October 19th the pair would inspire one of the most fondly remembered victories in Celtic history as the Bhoys destroyed Rangers 7-1 in the final of the League Cup. Billy would net a famous hat-trick but it was Sammy who set the ball rolling with the opening goal on 22 minutes. In doing so he set in motion a Celtic onslaught which will be remembered forever by Hoops supporters.<br><br><span class="diffAdd">He was a regular scorer for Celtic, and even once scored four goal in a match, in an 8-1 victory over Cowdenbeath in the League Cup. </span><br><br>Sadly for Sammy and Celtic, Billy McPhail was forced to retire in August 1958 due to a knee injury. With his perfect partner gone Sammy simply never looked the same player <span class="diffRemove">and</span><span class="diffAdd">reflected</span> <span class="diffRemove">he</span><span class="diffAdd">in his lower goal scoring rate in season 1958/59 compared the previous season. He</span> was <span class="diffAdd">struggling for goals through much of the season.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">He was </span>released in the summer of 1959 <span class="diffRemove">when he went</span><span class="diffAdd">moving</span> on to join Millwall in the lower reaches of the English Football League where he played 23 games and scored 11 goals in the 1959/60 season. <br><br>Sammy surprisingly in the summer of 1960, having spent only one season in England, moved back to Scotland to continue his professional football career, albeit on a part time basis, by signing for Highland Football League Club, Ross County F.C. in the north of Scotland, where he spent many seasons, then finally signing for his last professional club, Brora Rangers FC, again in the Highland Football League, but this time in the far north of Scotland.<br><br>An interesting point is that he had to combine playing for Celtic with training to be a motor mechanic. Working one Sunday in four to make up for playing football, a far cry from the modern first team footballer at Celtic.<br><br>Sammy Wilson hit an incredible 46 goals in 70 appearances for Celtic and will forever be remembered as a fabled hero of that glorious day in the Hampden sunshine.<br><br>He passed away in Nov 2014. <br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Playing Career </h3><div align="center">  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-all" width="400">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">APPEARANCES</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b><font color="#000000">LEAGUE</font></b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>SCOTTISH CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>LEAGUE CUP</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>EUROPE</b></td>  <td align="center" width="16%">  <b>TOTAL</b></td></tr>  <tr>  <td width="16%">1957-59</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">48</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">8</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">14</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">-</td>  <td align="center" width="16%">70</td></tr><tr><td width="16%">Goals</td><td align="center" width="16%">26</td><td align="center" width="16%">7</td><td align="center" width="16%">13</td><td align="center" width="16%">-</td><td align="center" width="16%">46</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h3>  Honours with Celtic<br></h3><b>League Cup</b><br><ul><li><font size="2">1957 (&quot;<a href="/page/1957-10-19%3A+Celtic+7-1+Rangers%2C+League+Cup" target="_self">Hampden in the Sun</a>&quot;)</font><br></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Pictures</h3>  <ul><li>  <a href="/page/Wilson%2C+Sammy+-+Pics" target="_self">Player Pics</a></li></ul><h3>  Links</h3> <ul><li><a href="/page/1957-10-19%3A+Celtic+7-1+Rangers%2C+League+Cup" target="_self">Hampden in the Sun</a><br></li></ul>   <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br><img align="bottom" alt="Wilson, Sammy - Picture" height="779" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/U8vN7OgPveaA-_ZHCNTEdg161158/GW564H779" title="Wilson, Sammy - Picture" width="564"><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  </h3><h3>7-1 GOAL HERO, SAMMY WILSON, PASSES AWAY</h3><h3></h3><br>By: Joe Sullivan on 10 Nov, 2014 15:21<br>Celticfc.net<br><br>EVERYONE at Celtic Park was saddened to hear of the death of Sammy Wilson at the weekend.<br><br>Sammy was the scorer of the first goal in the 7-1 League Cup final win over Rangers in 1957.<br><br>He  passed away on Saturday at the age of 83 and following scoring 46 goals  in 70 Celtic games between 1957 and 1959, he moved down south before  returning to Scotland and significantly raising the profile of the  Highland League in spotting players there.<br><br>As recently as the  Inverness Caley Thistle match on November 1, we had former Celt Roddy  MacDonald featured in the matchday programme and he was singing the  praises of the man who delivered him to Celtic.<br><br>MacDonald helped  blaze a trail for aspiring footballers from the Highlands &ndash; and he  believes he has Celtic&rsquo;s Hampden hero Sammy Wilson to thank for making  it possible for him and many others.<br><br>Few players were picked up  by the professional clubs in his part of the country prior to his era  but the arrival of Wilson in the area opened up a pathway to the big  time.<br><br>After finishing his career in the Highlands at Brora  Rangers, Wilson stayed in the region, coaching youngsters and managing a  number of local teams. He also became a talent-spotter for the  professional clubs.<br><br>Having quickly identified MacDonald as  someone capable of making it in the big time, Wilson brought the stopper  to Brora Rangers and deployed him up front. He believed goals would  garner greater attention on his young prot&eacute;g&eacute; and so it proved.<br><br>Wilson  secured MacDonald a trial at Celtic and his performances prompted Jock  Stein and Sean Fallon to head up the A9 and visit the family home to  secure his signature.<br>Image<br><br>MacDonald said: &ldquo;Just prior to  coming down to Celtic, it was really difficult for any player of  potential to get noticed in the Highlands. I was fortunate Sammy Wilson  came up when I was 14-15 and he started doing some coaching for the  youth players in the area.<br><br>&ldquo;He was coaching at Ross County&rsquo;s  ground on a Sunday mornings for all the young ones and we used to show  up there. He started up a couple of teams and I ended up playing for him  in the local team. He then set up Easter Ross, winning the league and  cup, before progressing on to Brora, where he took me to play as a  centre-forward.<br><br>He added: &ldquo;If Sammy hadn&rsquo;t been up there, it  would have been impossible for me to get picked up or noticed. He had a  great career and was a cracking player. He played for Celtic for a few  years, including the 7-1 game when Celtic beat Rangers.<br><br>&ldquo;He even  played for the Easter Ross team that I played in and you could still see  he had great ability. He had the contacts and it was a case of he would  see how I was developing and then he would make people aware down the  road. I had a few trials with teams but that was all to give me  experience as I believe he had Celtic lined up to take me down when the  time was right. I don&rsquo;t think I would have got my move to Celtic if it  wasn&rsquo;t for him.&rdquo;<br><br>Sammy Wilson aso proved to be an influence on  other players. MacDonald said: &ldquo;I know when I was younger there was  nobody else up there with his experience, who was giving youth a chance  and to attract bigger clubs down south to look at players but he had  plenty of contacts that way.<br><br>&ldquo;Eventually players did get noticed  and picked up. There was Eric Black and Bryan Gunn but you also had  Donald Park who was brought up in Fort William and played in the  Highland League.<br><br>&ldquo;Sammy Wilson helped open doors. You felt there  was chance if you had skill, ability and the potential to do well. And  it did give people a lot of encouragement when myself and other players  were getting an opportunity.<br><br>&ldquo;It gave everybody a lift &ndash; we  weren&rsquo;t just a backdrop somewhere that never got noticed. Today, players  are getting a chance up there.

It was the club&rsquo;s record score against their old rivals, and remains the highest score recorded in an English or Scottish cup final, though not, as is often reported, a British record, as higher winning scores were achieved in the early years of the Irish and Welsh Cups.<br><br>Wilson was the scorer of the first goal in that final, and, in all, he played 70 matches for the Parkhead club, scoring 46 goals, a remarkable return for a player who was not an out-and-out striker.<br><br>He was also instrumental in Celtic signing his fellow townsman Jimmy Johnstone, voted the club&rsquo;s greatest-ever player, who would become Wilson&rsquo;s friend for life.<br><br>Born into a family of nine in Uddingston, the small dormitory town in Lanarkshire not far from the East End of Glasgow, Wilson was educated at St John the Baptist Primary before moving to a brief secondary education before an apprenticeship as a car mechanic which would be a mainstay during his non-football life.<br><br>His youthful footballing talents took him to Renfrew Juniors, where he made his debut at just 17. Starting out as an industrious midfielder, he made an impact locally, so that Paisley club St Mirren, then managed by Bobby Rankin, swooped on their near neighbours to sign Wilson as a professional at 19.<br><br>In all he spent six years at Love Street, playing 52 competitive matches for the Buddies, and scoring ten goals. With the number of his first team games falling, he was released by manager Willie Reid in May, 1957.<br><br>Wilson was promptly signed by then Celtic manager Jimmy McGrory, primarily as cover for more established stars in a team that had largely under-achieved since winning the League and Cup double of 1954. But any side with the likes of Bobby Collins, Willie Fernie, Bertie Peacock and the irrepressible legend that was Charlie Tully was always going to be hard to break into.<br><br>McGrory gave Wilson his chance, however, particularly in the League Cup which at that time was played at the start of the season and was completed before the Scottish Cup got under way.<br><br>He made his debut for Celtic in the 4-1 League Cup win over East Fife on 14 August, 1957, playing at right half. The key moment in Wilson&rsquo;s career came when McGrory &ndash; though some say it was the idea of dictatorial chairman Robert Kelly &ndash; switched him to playing at inside left alongside centre forward Billy McPhail. The two men struck up an immediate and fruitful partnership, and they were soon rattling in the goals as Celtic progressed to their second successive League Cup final, Wilson notching six goals in all.<br><br>By then, Wilson was employed part-time as a car mechanic, and came to an arrangement with his employer that he would work one in four Sundays so that he could get Saturday afternoons off to play for Celtic &ndash; a far cry from the modern player&rsquo;s lot.<br><br>Fans used to seeing Old Firm finals as a matter of course in subsequent decades may be amazed to learn that it was the first time Celtic had played Rangers in the final of either major domestic trophy since 1928, albeit that the League Cup had only been going since season 1946-47.<br><br>Celtic were determined to defend the Cup they had won for the first time the previous year against Partick Thistle, and they attacked Rangers from the first whistle. They had already hit the crossbar and post when Wilson got his moment of glory after 22 minutes.<br><br>A cross into the Rangers penalty area was met by McPhail, who nodded the ball down to his striking partner, Wilson volleying past goalkeeper George Niven and full-backs Bobby Shearer and Eric Caldow on the line with a lovely right-foot shot. The floodgates opened, and Celtic rampaged to their most hallowed victory over Rangers.<br><br>Sadly for him, Wilson&rsquo;s career at Celtic was effectively doomed the following year when McPhail suffered a serious injury that stopped him playing. By then he had made a massive contribution to Celtic&rsquo;s future, acting on a local teacher&rsquo;s recommendation and suggesting Jimmy Johnstone from Viewpark, Uddingston, as a youngster to be watched, which he duly was.<br><br>Celtic released Wilson on a free transfer and he went down south to Millwall to try his luck, scoring 11 goals in 23 games for them. Moves to Northampton Town and Mansfield Town followed before he returned to Scotland in 1961, playing for Ross County in the Highland League.<br><br>After finishing his career at Brora Rangers, Wilson stayed north coaching youngsters for Ross County and Brora and managing a number of local teams. He made his home in Invergordon and also became a talent-spotter for the professional clubs, with Brora&rsquo;s Roddy MacDonald, who signed for Celtic, his best-known recommendation.<br><br>Wilson, who had no children, was predeceased by his wife but is survived by his sister Elizabeth. His funeral took place on 17 November at St John the Baptist&rsquo;s Church in Uddingston, where he attended daily Mass until the day before he died.<br><br>Fittingly, it is the same church that hosted the funeral of his great friend Jimmy Johnstone in 2006.  <br></div>
