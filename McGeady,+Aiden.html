I think he can play a lot better but maybe that&#39;s the story of Aiden&#39;s career.&quot;<br><b>Roy Keane (ex-Celt &amp; Ireland assistant manager) on Aiden McGeady (May 2016)</b></td></tr></tbody></table><br></font><h3><img align="right" alt="[Untitled]" height="302" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/a740e0e4cc8763774871e799e4d6ca74/GW226H302" title="[Untitled]" width="226"></h3><font color="#000000">Having attended and achieved good examination results at St.Ninians RC Secondary in Giffnock on the South Side of Glasgow, Aiden McGeady then burst onto the Celtic scene (scoring after just 17 mins in his debut against Hearts) and was lauded from the word go. There was no denying his precocious talent and for many he was the best young talent for many a year. Young and eager he was that talent which Celtic fans had all been yearning for, but </font><font color="#000000">things were to not all work out to plan or as hoped over his time at the club. </font></div><font color="#000000"><br>Undoubtedly skilful with twists and turns down the wings (and the ability to do incredible step-overs with the be-all to befuddle any defender), his end ball could be frustratingly poor. A good run and then beating a few defenders wasted by a poor cross or a lost ball at the next tackle meant it could all be in vain, and during the 2006-07 season after a fair start the support was surprisingly split down the middle over the player more so than any other over recent seasons. One extreme saying he was a one trick pony whilst the other side that he was a fine precocious talent and people should have patience with him.</font>   <br><br>He had a great skill to be able to turn the ball almost inside out with his turns and left defenders flailing in his wake. The moments could be funny to watch too, and showed his natural talent to entertain as much as a lot else.<br><br><font color="#000000">The arrival of Shaun Maloney into the first team as a regular pushed McGeady behind in the pecking order, and after a fine season Maloney had cemented himself in the starting line-up. In some ways this was good for Aiden. Firstly it took the attention/pressure of him with another young player taking the limelight instead, and second as it gave him a kick in order to show that he had a lot still to learn and do. </font><br><br><b>National side</b><br><font color="#000000">His most difficult decision was his decision to play for Ireland instead of Scotland. Pi<font color="#333333">lloried by the Scottish press for this decision, they seem to ignore the fact that it was the Irish association would were willing to assist him when he was a teenager whilst the Scottish association didn&rsquo;t at all. McGeady had said that he promised his grandfather that he would play for Ireland, and so there should have been no issue over this. Sadly this is Scotland, and he became a big target for the boo boys from other clubs to target him during matches.</font></font><font color="#333333"> Would have liked if he chose to play for Scotland, but it&#39;s not as if he was opting to play for Ireland for the money!</font><br><br><b>2007-08</b><br><font color="#000000">After a few seasons of bedding in, it was in the 2007-08 season which was a big turnaround. McGeady cemented his place in the team with many fine performances and goals, although still some work-in-progress. The support was fully united in praise for his performances in what was an otherwise difficult season for the club with a roller coaster set of results. <br><br>Additionally, Shaun Maloney&rsquo;s move to Aston Villa was a warning to McGeady that leaving Celtic for the EPL (which he admitted did attract him for later in his career) is not all as great as it seems. Gordon Strachan (manager) praised McGeady for the work he put in over the season for conditioning himself better for the long season. Gone were the neddy days (some thought), although over time it was to seem that both he &amp; Strachan were to have at times a difficult working relationship. Notably, on Tommy Burns&#39; death, McGeady left a note for Tommy Burns with his flowers missing the great man and stating how he could rely on him. Tommy&#39;s loss to Celtic likely thus was also a big loss for McGeady too.</font><br><br><font color="#000000">To seal off a great season personally for McGeady, he was awarded the Player of the Season for 2008, which was a great way for him to get one back on all his critics, and showed his vast value to the first team. It was a tough season but he was a bulwark in pushing the side when on form.</font> <br><br><font color="#000000">However, his temper had got the better of him at times and referees sadly found him an easy target to book for silly tantrums which could be passed off if they were from other players.</font> He was improving but rough edges needed smoothed out.<br><br><b>2008-09</b><i><br></i>Not a vintage season for Celtic, and a bit of a step-back for McGeady. No denying his talent but with the squad tripping up continuously there was little he could do. McGeady&#39;s season will be remembered most due to a needless spat with manager Gordon Strachan. A very publicised following out with the manager saw McGeady disciplined publicly by the club for an outburst at a team post-match meeting. He was suspended from the squad for a few games, which created much debate amongst the fans, many supporting McGeady others backing the manager. The manager had made himself unpopular with some sections of the support, and in truth the debate wasn&#39;t really just a &quot;M<i>cGeady v Strachan</i>&quot; wrangle, and was used by different people to push their views on both to the hilt whether their points were relevant to the current events or not. <br><br>Notably, one of the games he missed was a game v Rangers, but as Celtic won that game and did comfortably in the other games he was out, it appeared to backfire on McGeady, and the manager&#39;s cries that it was about disciplinary reasons seem to have won out at the end. There were plenty of stories flying about that McGeady and WGS didn&#39;t get on and effectively he was going to leave at the end of the season or earlier if possible (Jan window). McGeady stayed but the team didn&#39;t work out well and McGeady was no better than most (but by no means the biggest issue in the team). <br><br>Celtic lost the league and it was a poor season overall for all. A change of manager at the end of the season was the best thing for all, and likely McGeady was happy with this too, but it was to be a double edged sword. McGeady&#39;s dissent was the only public slating of the manager by the players (only departed players made any criticisms otherwise), so really highlighted his general manner.<br><br><b>2009-10</b><br>While 2008-09 was a disappointing campaign for Celtic it was still a damn sight better than the season that followed. With Gordon Strachan now departed it was hoped that McGeady would flourish under new manager Tony Mowbrary and his stated desire to play attacking, passing football. It was to all fall apart, and not even a talent like McGeady could make a difference in such circumstances.<br><br>Despite a promising start to the season, it was not to be. Prior to Christmas, McGeady was undoubtedly one of Celtic&#39;s better performers - however that is damning with faint praise. In the early months of 2010 his form dipped and he yet again continued to frustrate with performances which frequently failed to do his obvious talent justice. A change of manager wasn&#39;t making any difference. <br><br>No longer a promising youngster, McGeady was now at a stage of his career where youth was no longer an excuse for his inconsistency. However, he was still highly valued and created many assists, providing space for others as defenders chased him.<br><br>In August 2010, McGeady was sold to Spartak Moscow for &pound;9.5M, making him the most expensive player ever to be sold from Scotland (to time of sale). Later reports (from Celtic TV &amp; Russia) actually indicate the figure was actually &pound;11m. Celtic needed the cash as well as the first team were to be now go two seasons without Champions League money. Celtic&#39;s board couldn&#39;t say no. It was said that former Celtic manager Martin O&#39;Neill resigned from Aston Villa on the back of lack of funds to buy players, of which included the opportunity to buy Aiden McGeady with whom he had been repeatedly linked to take down south.<br><br><h3>Review<br></h3>As repeatedly said earlier, Aiden McGeady was a cracking prodigious talent. He was able to many a time bamboozle the opposition defence with turns and moves we&#39;d not seen since Lubo. It was wonderful, and as a product of Celtic&#39;s youth system it was great to see a supporter play like he could at the club. He turned enough opposition players inside out which even they had to smile at the wonderful style of it all. <br><br>However, the difficult situation at Celtic with some poor coaching undermined the  ability he had. The abuse and pressures put on him by opposition fans for choosing Ireland  over Scotland for the internationals hadn&#39;t helped. He seemed to split  the Celtic support. Some ridiculously saw him as a one-trick pony, but many  just saw a boy with great talent who could take on many defences yet  then blow it all away with a powderpuff shot or a squandered pass.  Additionally, his crossing was not as incisive as it should have been (the coaches should have worked harder with him on it all). It was frustrating but when it  worked out it was terrific. <br><br>Most critics needed to see the facts as the Herald newspaper wrote: <i><br></i><blockquote><i>&quot;Last  season (2009-10), for example, McGeady was joint first in the creation of  goals in  the SPL with 14 assists. Steven Davis of Rangers who spent  most of the  season playing wide with the champions, also created 14.  McGeady scored  seven goals to three by the Northern Irishman. Indeed,  as far back as  2007, McGeady was the most prolific creator of chances  in the league  with 16. He was not a regular taker of set-pieces so  statistics show he  was the best at creating goals from open play.&quot;</i><br></blockquote><br>That shows a player of quality and ability. With better management and better players he could have been a far superior player with Celtic, but when his colleagues could be poor (e.g. Samaras) then really it&#39;s hard to not be downhearted and let the head go down. In truth, success in the SPL alone is not always the highest of benchmarks in light of the increasing emphasis on European competition, and even his staunchest supporter has to admit that the figures were actually a fraction of what his talent could have achieved.<br><br>People must also realise that many opposition defences had players double-up on McGeady. This left him little room for manoeuvre. As the team&#39;s most skilful player, he was the most targetted by the opposition fans with their continual barracking of him (due to opting against Scotland for international honours), and it made sure he had it tougher than any others. It&#39;s a back-handed compliment that he was targetted by defenders but it did give the other players room to take advantage, just meant that McGeady&#39;s best moments &amp; value could be missed by even Celtic&#39;s own support. <br><br>He was a hard worker in many games and deserves credit, you just need to see the below list of man-of-the-match awards as voted in the KDS forums, which showed his value to the first team.<br><br>One issue was off-field. Unfairly marked as a bit of a ned due to his hairstyle/looks/quirks etc, he was not a favourite with the more conservative in football (even within Celtic). The aforementioned spat with manager Gordon Strachan highlighted this tension, but in truth McGeady never really acted to put the club&#39;s name in the red. He was no better or worse than any other young man and it was easy for critics to over play it (and they did). McGeady to his credit just got on with things.<br><br>He really had the ability to be a great player for Celtic and achieve a lot. There were many great moments in his time that made the support roar with delight and he turned many a defence inside out, but he hadn&#39;t done enough to rank with the greats. He had many great achievements whilst he was at Celtic but he was never the lead architect of those as say Larsson, Sutton, McStay or Lubo. He might have become so in time, however he still played his part with the club and for that we will respect him.<br><br><div>We wished him the best. </div><div></div><div><h3><br>Post-Celtic</h3></div><div>You can argue it in many ways how McGeady&#39;s post-Celtic career panned out but really it&#39;s impossible to argue that it hit glorious heights. There were still some memorable moments along the way, but scant reward for his ability. <br><br>An expensive signing for Spartak Moscow, he helped them to the runner&#39;s up spot in the Russian Premier League, but no major medals in his time. At one time he got in trouble for striking an opponent and making an offensive gesture, and then also of vandalising a dressing room door at an opponent&#39;s. <br><br>His side even ended up with Celtic in the same Champions League group stages, but Celtic triumphed in both matches (including Celtic&#39;s first ever away match victory in the Champions League group stages) and went through in second place. Spartak finished humiliatingly bottom of the group. Regardless, he was a regular in his three seasons at Spartak, but he didn&#39;t seem to set the heather alight.<br><br>He then moved to Everton to where things really didn&#39;t work out, although Everton has often been a dead-end for many. Ex-Rangers player Steven Naismith was a player of far inferior quality, but proved more valuable for Everton. McGeady despite all his talent just didn&#39;t settle in well at Everton. </div><div></div><div><br>Later moved to Sheffield and Preston NE (their player of the year 2017) in the lower tiers on loan spells, before ending up at Sunderland who had been relegated to the 3rd tier in England. <br><br>There were rumours and discussions of bringing him home to Glasgow by some supporters and he was questioned on this but both he &amp; Celtic had moved on. There was no real demand from either side for it.<br><br>One notable match for McGeady at Celtic Park was a Scotland v Ireland international qualifier for Euro 2016, Scotland winning 1-0 with the goal scored by former Celtic colleague Maloney. The match was moved to Celtic Park due to refitting at Hampden Park for the Commonwealth Games. The sad fact is that there was abuse &amp; booing from various Scotland fans at McGeady for his choice of Ireland. He had the last say as Ireland qualified for the Euros with Scotland again failing at the qualifying stages despite being in the driving seat at one point.<br><br>One further sad sticking point for McGeady was that despite having amassed 92 caps with 5 goals for Ireland, some commentators were stating that there have been few other players who have amassed so many caps Ireland (or anywhere) with so little fanfare. He came so close to 100 caps but was being little heralded despite the milestone. He wasn&#39;t doing badly but too many wasn&#39;t proving his high value as against the skill all knew he had. As ex-Celtic player and McGeady&#39;s later Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane once caustically remarked:<br><blockquote><i>&quot;My reaction to Aiden&#39;s performance? I think he can play a lot better but maybe that&#39;s the story of Aiden&#39;s career.&quot;</i><br></blockquote></div><div><br>His greatest legacy will probably be the <i>McGeady Spin</i>, a term derived for a move in which when tackled by two opposition players he would bamboozle the attacking players, playing the ball off one foot and the next, and then turning the whole move inside out and spinning round, leaving the defenders for dead and lighting up any game. It is a term used across all football, and has been attempted by many but few are able to make it payoff like Aiden McGeady could.</div><div><br>[....]</div> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">   <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderLeft-none WPC-edit-custom-borderLeft WPC-edit-borderRight-none WPC-edit-custom-borderRight" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody> </table> <h3>Playing Career</h3>  <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="WPC-edit-style-grid1 WPC-edit-border-all WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="680">        <tbody><tr>   <td class="xl64" width="89"><b><font size="2">Club</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" width="90"><b><font size="2">From</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" width="94"><b><font size="2">To</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" width="64"><b><font size="2">Fee</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" colspan="2" width="128"><b><font size="2">League</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" colspan="2" width="128"><b><font size="2">Scottish Cup</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" colspan="2" width="128"><b><font size="2">League cup</font></b></td>   <td class="xl64" colspan="2" width="128"><b><font size="2">Other</font></b></td>  </tr>  <tr>   <td class="xl67" width="89"><font size="2">Sp.
