McNair and Dodds were not in the side defeated by Falkirk, and their absence meant Shaw having the first opportunity of proving that he is in the first flight of goalkeepers. At Motherwell both full backs were off their game, and again Shaw atoned for their deficiencies as he had done earlier in their absence. Last season as a member of the Queen&rsquo;s Park Rangers, Shaw kept goal for the Southern League against Scotland, and if Brownlie be unavailable on Saturday the Scottish goal will not suffer at Shaw&rsquo;s hand against Ireland. The Celtic attack was an uneven affair, only McAtee, McColl, and in a lesser degree Gallagher pleasing, and had the inside forwards given McColl better support the ex-junior would have given his directors more reason to believe that they have secured a worthy successor to Quinn. Motherwell were not prominent in the tie as in either of the League matches with Celtic, yet their forwards were often dangerous, and Shaw it was who prevented a replay.   <br><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><b>MOTHERWELL:<br></b><a class="external" href="http://www.stamford-bridge.com/player.php?id=231&surname=Hampton&firstname=Colin" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hampton</a>, Wilson, <span class="diffRemove">P</span><span class="diffAdd">Patrick</span> Kelly, <span class="diffAdd">Francis </span>McStay, <span class="diffRemove">D</span><span class="diffAdd">Duncan</span> Finlayson, <span class="diffAdd">David </span>Mair, JM Young, Gilchrist, <span class="diffAdd">George </span>Whitehead, <span class="diffRemove">J</span><span class="diffAdd">John</span> Gray, Hillhouse  <br><b>Scorer:</b> <br>Whitehead<br><br><b>CELTIC:<br></b><a href="/page/Shaw%2C+Charlie" target="_self">Shaw</a>, <a href="/page/McNair%2C+Alec" target="_self">McNair</a>, <a href="/page/Dodds%2C+Joe" target="_self">Dodds</a>, <a href="/page/Young%2C+James+%27Sunny+Jim%27" target="_self">Young</a>, <a href="/page/Johnstone%2C+Peter" target="_self">Johnstone</a>, <a href="/page/McMaster%2C+John" target="_self">McMaster</a>, <a href="/page/McAtee%2C+Andy" target="_self">McAtee</a>, <a href="/page/Gallacher%2C+Patsy" target="_self">Gallacher</a>, <a href="/page/McColl%2C+Jimmy" target="_self">McColl</a>,<a href="/page/McMenemy%2C+Jimmy" target="_self"> McMenemy</a>, <a href="/page/Browning%2C+John" target="_self">Browning</a><br><b>Scorers:</b> <br>Gallacher, McColl, McAtee<br><br><b>Referee</b>: J.

But Celtic science eventually triumphed.<br><br>There were many exciting incidents in the opening play, and Motherwell certainly had not always the best of luck. Three times Shaw saved in daring style, from Hillhouse, Gray, and J. M. Young, and once Gray hit the crossbar with a deadly shot.<br><br>Celtic were quieter nearer goal, although on one occasion McMenemy had hard luck in finding a neat header strike the crossbar when Hampton was beaten. Half an hour from the start Gallagher capped a beautiful touch-line run by McAtee, and gave Hampton no chance with a first-time shot from a dozen yards&rsquo; range.<br><br>The immediate effect of this goal was a spirited Motherwell pressure, but nothing earned.<br><br>For a spell a good deal of interest in the game evaporated from the game after the second goal, which fell to Celtic five minutes after the interval. McColl was the scorer, and the goal was a capital effort, the young centre beating Kelly, steadying up nicely, and sending the ball into the net well out of Hampton&rsquo;s reach.<br><br>Twenty minutes from the end, the game took an unexpected turn, when a penalty was awarded to Motherwell for Whitehead being impeded, presumably by McNair, in an endeavour to field Shaw. Whitehead scored from the kick, although Shaw got his hand to the ball.<br><br>Shaw&rsquo;s brilliant saving was the feature of the succeeding play, as it had been of the game, and he baffled Motherwell on every occasion, while McAtee, in the last minute, placed the issue beyond all doubt by scoring a third goal.   <br><br><b>Pics:</b><br>The Scotsman, page 8.<br><br>  Partisan Fighting in Motherwell Streets.- In connection with the Scottish Football Cup tie between Motherwell and Celtic, there was some disorder in the streets of Motherwell on Saturday afternoon.<br><br>The most serious incident occurred at what is known as the &ldquo;County Corner,&rdquo; at the junction of Muir Street and Milton Street, the Orange quarter of the town.<br><br>It is alleged that several char-a-bancs filled with supporters of the Celtic Club on the way to the match were interfered with by Orangemen.<br>When the match was over, and the vehicles were on their way back to Glasgow, the occupants alighted at the railway station, about three hundred yards from the former incident, and with pockets well filled with stones and bottles, and waving green flags, marched in a strong body upon the County Corner.<br><br>They met with stout resistance, and a battle-royal ensued. Stones, sticks, and bottles were thrown in all directions, and many hand to hand conflicts took place.<br><br>In many instances the flags were riven from the hands of the Celtic supporters and used as weapons against their owners.<br><br>Many of the combatants sustained bruises, and one policeman was struck on the head with a stone. The constables on the scene were practically powerless to quell the disturbance and it was only when the motor brakes drove forward and picked up their passengers that the affair began to die down.<br><br>Before the vehicles got out of the way however, they were subjected to volleys of stones, and some of them were damaged. Several arrests were made.   <br><br><img align="bottom" alt="1914 SC riot" height="1033" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/482c06087f104363986a7257ed4fbf91/GW459H1033" title="1914 SC riot" width="459"><br></div>
