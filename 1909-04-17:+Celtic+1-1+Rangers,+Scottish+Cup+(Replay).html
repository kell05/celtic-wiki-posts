Most of the players and fans alike assumed that there would be extra   time. However under the rules of the SFA, extra time was only   permissible for the second replay. <br><br>When the referee blew the   final whistle, a number of players remained on the pitch as if in   expectation of extra time. Encouraged by this, many of the spectators   also stood their ground. A rumour spread around the terraces that the   result had been pre-arranged to secure a third lucrative pay day. The   players were invited to leave the pitch and when the uprooting of corner   flags by a groundsman made clear there would be no further play, the   crowd spilled on to the pitch. They appeared to be on their way to the   dressing rooms with the intention of persuading the teams to come out   again. The police barred their way, and the players quietly left the   stadium.<br><br>The spectators then turned their wrath on the   constabulary, and a full-scale riot was soon in progress. Wooden   barricading torn from the terracing was set alight on the track around   the playing area. Hundreds of fans spilled onto the pitch and took their   anger out by tearing down the goals, cutting up the turf and setting   fire to the pay-boxes [see picture above] and stand, using whisky as   fuel. Some of the rioters tore up and down the pitch with a roller. The   fire brigade was summoned when pay boxes were set ablaze and police   reinforcements arrived from all over the city. The rioters slashed the   hoses of the firemen and abused and obstructed ambulance men.<br><br>Arrests   proved almost impossible, with the police constantly having to rescue   isolated and endangered colleagues. Knives, stones, bottles and   fragments of wood were used as weapons. More than 100 people were hurt   during the rioting, many of them police and firemen; it was reported   that fifty-four policemen had been injured.<br><br>Even when the fans   were finally forced from the ground, they continued to attack the police   outside, and set about breaking windows in nearby houses and smashing   street lamps. The riot went on for two hours or more, and damage was   estimated at &pound;800.<br><br>When the Scottish Football Association met to   consider the matter the following Monday, both clubs made it clear that   they did not wish to stage another replay, so the final was never   decided and the cup and players medals were withheld<br><br>The   association gave Queen&#39;s Park &pound;500 towards repairs to the stadium and   ordered the two clubs to pay &pound;150 each - a negligible sum in view of the   fact that the total takings from the two matches fell not far short of   &pound;4000.<br><br>The press was scathing in its treatment of the rioters.   The Pall Mall Gazette of April 10, for example, reacted: &quot;The football   craze is one of the most active deleterious influences to which the   character of the masses is now subjected: and we cannot too soon set   about counteracting it with the wholesome discipline of military   training.&quot;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3>  <b>CELTIC: -</b> <br>Adams, McNair, Weir, Young, Dodds, Hay, Kivlichen, McMenemy, Quinn, Somers, Hamilton.<br><b>Scorers: -</b> Quinn.<br><b><br>RANGERS: -</b> <br>Rennie, Law, Craig, Gordon, Stark, Galt, Bennet, McDonald, Reid, McPherson, A.

The  finalists in the competition for the Scottish cup are the Celtic and  Rangers, Glasgow clubs, which on 10th April drew with two goals each.  The replay took place on Saturday on the ground of the Queen&#39;s Park at  Hampden, Mount Florida, and again the teams drew, on this occasion with  one goal each. At the close of the game the spectators, incensed. at the  decision not to play an extra, half-hour, and thus resolve the destiny  of the cup, broke all bounds, and a riot ensued, in which the police and  the mob came into prolonged conflict with the most serious  consequences. The scene is described as resembling that of a battlefield  , and after the long-drawn m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, the horrors of which were heightened  by the action of the crowd, in setting fire to all the combustible  material on which they could lay their hands, it was found that no fewer  than sixty people wore on the official list of causalities, suffering  from injuries , in some cases of a dangerous nature. This list does not  include many who were attended on the field without being sent to the  Infirmary or dealt with officially. The number of the unknown injured is  computed at a figure equal to that of those known, which brings the  final casualty list to considerably over a hundred. <br><br>A SECOND LANGSIDE<br>Saturday  afternoon was beautifully fine and a crowd of spectators, estimated at  between 60,000 and 70,000 persons, was attracted to Hampden Park, which  occupies a, romantic site on the outskirts of the city, generally  included by antiquarians as part of the historic battlefield of Langside  . The rivalry between the teams is of the keenest nature, and the  crowd, as is usual on such occasions, was divided into two camps, whose  excitement rose to the highest pitch when, at the close of play the  teams were level. It seems to have been generally understood that in the  event of a draw on this occasion, the contest would be fought to a  finish with an extra half hour&#39;s play. In the official police report it  is stated that after the referee had blown his whistle announcing the  finish, the members of the Celtic team remained on the field, thus  heightening the prevailing impression. The members of the Rangers&#39; team  quitted the pitch, however, and their example was followed, shortly afterword by their opponents.<br><br>Strong in their preconceived belief, the  majority of the spectators retained their positions for some time  although many thousands took their departure. Meantime the Football  Association had decided that the game would not be renewed, and an  intimation this effect was made. Keen dissatisfaction prevailed among  the crowd, and protests were heard on many hands, culminating in threats  and an outbreak of disorder among the more rowdy elements. The first  overt action which resulted in the lamentable scone of the day was the  invasion of the playing pitch by a number of the dissatisfied onlookers,  their evident intention being to proceed to the dressing-rooms, whither  the players had retired. A considerable force of police were, of  course, on the ground, and they naturally endeavoured to keep the crowd  in order, and to induce them to leave the field peacefully . What  actually first led to a collision between the police and the civilians  is at present matter of the most conflicting opinion. Soon, however, the  mob wore venting their rage on the police force, who were subjected to a  fusillade of stones, bottles, brickbats, and every conceivable missile  of which the roughs could become possessed. Overwhelmed and swept aside  by superior numbers, the police rallied, and endeavoured to cope with  their assailants. To this end they were forced to use their batons, and  shortly they wore engaged in a hand to hand conflict. The gravity of the  situation became apparent when a number of the policemen were seen to  have sustained such injuries that they were rendered prostrate, and had  to be carried off the field. <br><br>THE RAGE OF THE MOB. <br>It  would be impossible adequately to describe the many cruel incidents  which went to make up a riot now proceeding in almost every quarter of  the field. Stricken men, fell with blood streaming from their wounds,  and the rage and tumult became more intense. Many of the police were  beaten and injured in the most brutal and callous fashion, and the force  as a whole were the chief sufferers of the day. It was generally  remarked that those of the crowd most active in the disturbance wore  composed of the most degraded section of the community, the  self-respecting portion having as far as possible retired when the  character of the fray became apparent. Thousands, however, who would  gladly have quitted the scene, now found it impossible to leave, since  those outside were massed at the exits, and outlet was a matter of great  difficulty. <br><br>Maddened by excitement, and relying on their  overwhelming numbers, the rioters now proceeded to the extremest limits.  The goal-posts wore attacked, and uprooted, the nets torn to pieces,  and the woodwork around the enclosure broken down to be used as weapons,  against the police. Acting with commendable patience and restraint, the  police force, who were shortly reinforced by the arrival of reserves  from almost every district in the city, persevered in their attempt to  clear the ground. A number of mounted men were found to be of great  assistance; but the mob took a. malicious delight in surrounding the  horsemen, and endeavouring to force them to dismount. They beat man and  horse most unmercifully, and in some cases the man was pulled to the  ground. Not only had the police to persist in their own work of  overcoming the mob, but, they had to protect , and rescue each other.  Where a solitary policeman was trapped he was dealt with in the most  outrageous manner, and it is little wonder that rumour had it that  several of them had been killed. <br><br>INCENDIARY TACTICS. <br>The  objective of the rioters, as has been indicated , was evidently the  dressing-boxes of the players, but the police force were successful in  repelling the attack. It was soon obvious, however, that new outlets for  the prevalent passion had been found. Quantities of the broken  barricading were collected, piled in a heap, and ignited. Quite a number  of the crowd were in possession of bottles containing whisky, and they  were actually seen to pour the fluid on the broken timber in order to  aid its quicker ignition. Soon a huge bonfire was in progress, fed by  fuel brought from every possible quarter. Attention was next directed to  the pay boxes at the north-west entrance, and they were also soon a  mass of flames. It was found necessary to summon the Fire Brigade, who  arrived on the scene shortly after six o&#39;clock. The defenceless firemen  were on their arrival maltreated in similar fashion to the police, and  at least one of them, John Kennedy, of the Queen&#39;s Park Division, was  seriously injured. He is suffering from a number of broken ribs, When  the firemen attempted to get to work their hosepipes were seized and  thrown into the flames. Others, which were brought into position, were  cut and hacked at with knives. Stones, bottles, and the other available  missiles were hurled, at the firemen, who, of course, were quite unable  to defend themselves. Ultimately; they succeeded in extinguishing the  fire, but not before very considerable damage was done. <br><br>When all  the reserves had been hurried up from the district police offices,  there would be about 200 constables on the field, including about 16  horsemen. The difficulty was to drive the crowds up the slopes  surrounding the pitch, and the method adopted was to force them out of  the grounds in batches. But long before comparative order had been  restored, the casualty list had reached appalling proportions.. A number  of medical men who happened to be present, set themselves devotedly to  the work of attending to the injured. These gentlemen included two  doctors, Jamieson, father and son, and Dr D. M&#39;Ardle, of Stobhill  Hospital. Later they were reinforced by assistance from the Victoria  Infirmary, which is situated in the neighbourhood. Ambulance wagons  were summoned, and, after being temporarily attended to, the sufferers  wore conveyed to the Victoria Infirmary. One of the injured was attended  at the Royal Infirmary, which, is several miles distant . The spectacle  presented in the football pavilion and neighbourhood, where the medical  work was proceeding, resembled nothing so much as what one would  picture occurring in the rear of a battle. Numbers of man were being  brought in in an unconscious condition, suffering from wounds in the  fight, and, in some instances, from the crushing which occasionally took  place. <br><br>DURATION OF THE RIOT. <br>It would be about ten  minutes past five o&#39;clock when the football match finished, and an idea  of the prolonged character of the riot will be gained when it is stated  that order was not restored till half-past seven. Gradually the police  effected a clearance of the pitch and its environs, but not before the  field had been reduced to a wreck. At one time a section. of the crowd  tore up and-down the field with a road roller, cutting the ground badly,  and committing every damage in their power. With the exception of the  pavilion and the Press box, all the other erections wore damaged or  wrecked by fire or assault. The police stationed outside the barricading  had their hands as full as those inside. When the unruly roughs wore  ultimately ejected from the field, they remained in great crowds  outside, and continued the fusillade of brick-bats. Not a piece of glass  escaped which could be reached by stones, and the crowd exhibited a  delight in wreaking their revenge on the persons of the police and  firemen, and in the destruction of the property of the club. Fortunately  they wore unaware that the Football Association officials, were  occupants at the moment of rooms in Somerville Place, on the opposite  side of the street from the main entrance to the park These gentleman  had in their possession, drawings to the amount of &pound;1400, and were also  guarding the Scottish Cup, which would have been awarded to the victor  of the game. It may be mentioned that among the spectators of the day  was Captain Gilmour, prospective Unionist candidate for East  Renfrewshire. His duty would have been to hand the Cup to the successful  team, had the game not been drawn. <br><br>Among the minor incidents of  the day was the exhibition of the craze for souvenirs. The crossbar of  one of the goal posts was carried from the field into Somerville   Road  in front of the burning pay boxes and a crowd of men and boys hacked at  it with pocket knives and pocketed the chips. Among the debris littering  the ground were a number of policen&rsquo;s helmets, which had been lost in  the day&rsquo;s struggle. These were also the objective of the  souvenir-hunter, being cut into strips and carried away.<br><br>PUBLIC EXCITEMENT<br>Needless  to say, the district was in a condition of seething excitement during  the course , of the unfortunate affair. The windows in Somerville    Drive, which overlook the ground, wore crowded with people, who followed  the progress of events with nervous dismay. Thousands of those who had  attended the match left as it was concluding and were totally .unaware  of what subsequently occurred. Many, however, who would otherwise have  proceeded home with the utmost dispatch hung about the vicinity to watch  the spectacle. Not till the evening journals issued their late editions  was the city apprised of the riot. The news created in interest  comparable only to that aroused by the occurrence of the great Ibrox  Park disaster, at which hundreds of people were injured, and over twenty  killed. The magnitude of Saturday &#39;s melee was exaggerated by rumour,  and it was confidently asserted that several of the injured had  succumbed. Fortunately there has been in no case a fatal result, and  such an eventuality is not anticipated. Only five of the injured are  detained in Victoria Infirmary, although the case of the fireman,  Kennedy, is probably as serious as any. <br><br>Curious to relate only  one man was arrested in the course of the outbreak. He has been lodged  in the Queen&#39;s Park Police Office and will be brought up to-day on a  charge of assaulting- a policeman and a soldier. It is stated that a  plain clothes constable obtained the assistance of the soldier to effect  the arrest. The police were, of course, practically powerless in the  matter of apprehensions. Instances are recorded of rioters being taken  into custody, but so savagely were the police handled that they were  forced to let go their quarry. <br><br>YESTERDAY&rsquo;S SCENE AND SIGHTSEERS<br>All  day yesterday crowds of people flocked to Mount Florida to view the  scene. Overnight there were posted on the ground thirty constables in  case of the eventuality of the return of the mob. A force of police  still guarded the ground yesterday, and the public were rigidly excluded  from it. Early in the morning the services .of a number of joiners had  been requisitioned, and the barricading and shattered gates set to  rights as much as possible . Notwithstanding their exertions, however,  the place presented, a sorry sight. All the woodwork at the Somerville  Drive entrances had been burned away or remains charred, and what is  left is a mass of torn, twisted, or bent galvanised iron, The enclosure  itself is a litter of stones and broken bottles, and scarred patches  where fire has been at work. All the public lamps in the vicinity have  been smashed. Only the roughest estimate can be obtained of the amount  which will be required to set the place to rights, but &pound;800 is  considered a moderate figure. Interesting, questions as to liability  most arise. &#39;It may be confidently expected that many different claims  will be lodged. <br><br>QUESTION OF REPLAY. <br>The question, of a  replay of the game will be discussed at a meeting of the Football  Association to be hold in Glasgow this evening. There have been many  speculations on the point, and the opinion is generally held that the  game will now be abandoned. The officials of the Association are  naturally greatly distressed at the extremely unfortunate debacle which  followed Saturday&#39;s game. It would seem by the rules of the Association  that only in the case of a third draw can play be continued for an extra  half-hour. <br><br>In the course of yesterday Chief-Constable  Stevenson, accompanied by Superintendent Ferguson , of the Queen&#39;s Park  division, paid a visit to Victoria Infirmary to make inquiry regarding  the condition of the injured. Afterwards they drove to Hampden Park,  where they carried out an inspection. The Chief Constable&#39;s clerk also  visited the scene for the purposes of a report, which will in duo course  be considered by the legal and other authorities, and ultimate action  be decided thereupon. It is too soon yet to state whether any inquiry of  a. public nature will be instituted, although it seems unlikely that  such a.-menace to law and order can pass unnoticed.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>The Scotsman - Tuesday, 20th April 1909 </h3><br>Mr  Maley, the Celtic Club representative, then called. In reply to  questions, he stated that there had been no arrangement between either  the teams or the committees of the teams before the match to stay on and  play an extra, half-hour in the event of a draw. He could not explain  why it was that some of the Celtic players remained on the field after  the referee blew the whistle. Asked if there was any representation made  by his club to the Rangers to have the game played to a finish. Mr  Maley said he had asked, one of the Rangers on Tuesday whether they  would play extra.time. <br><br>The Celtic captain was next called, and  was asked if he could give say explanation why some of his team remained  on the field after the referee blew the whistle. He said that when he  was leaving the field he met two or three of the Rangers, who asked the  referee if there was any word of playing an extra half-hour. The referee  replied that he had no word. Witness thereafter went straight to the  pavilion. In answer to a further question, he said some of the Rangers  plavers were on the field as well as the Celtic players after the  whistle was blown.<br><br>Mr McKenzie, representative of the Rangers,  corroborated the statement that there had been no agreement between the  committees, or the teams that they should play extra time in the event  of a draw. He had met Mr Malev earlier, in the week, who had asked him  if he had had any request to play extra, but there was nothing more than  that.<br><br>Mr Stark, also of the Rangers, said that as soon as the  referee&#39;s whistle blew he left the field. He understood that some of the  Rangers remained on the field, but they were not told to do so. <br><br>PLAYERS&rsquo; HESITANCY<br>Mr  Campbell, linesman, said he thought a good deal was being made of the  fact that players remained on the field for some time after the finish  of the game. As a matter of fact, the time the players remained on the  field was not longer than they would remain in. any game. The referee  asked him. if there was any arrangement for extra p!ay, and he replied  that there was not, and before he went in he would say that at least  three-fourths of the players were in front of him, and there was really  very little time wasted in getting off the field.<br><br>Mr Christie  said it was as a matter of fact a rule when the whistle blows every  player made a rush for the pavilion, and got there as soon as possible.  But on Saturday the players remained on the field a long while after the  linesman and the referee were in the pavilion. They stood talking to  each other, and at one time there were two Rangers players almost on the  track when they were called back by somebody. They came back and spoke  to somebody. Now, that took a little time.<br><br>Then they began to drop  off, but all this gave the impression that there was some  misunderstanding, and the spectators might certainly have been misled by  the players remaining on the field. If the players did not know exactly  what they were to do how could the public know? Had the players left  the field immediately the whistle sounded it might, he was not going to  say, it would, have prevented the riot. There had been a good many  reports going about last week, and they might have been misleading, too.  <br><br>The Chairman did not think they could make very much of that point  after all was said and done. It might be true that there was some  hesitancy. about the players leaving the field, but he was perfectly  satisfied of this, that they did not remain on field with the  instructions of the directors. <br><br>PETITION TO ABANDON MATCH. <br>Mr  Maley, representing the Celtic, and Mr Mackenzie, representing the  Rangers, were recalled and questioned by the Chairman as to a letter  appearing in several newspapers of that morning purporting to be a  petition to the Association, to abandon the match. Mr Mackenzie said  that as regarded the Rangers they accepted responsibility, and the  Celtic, who had also agreed, to the document, had a copy of it in their  possession. <br><br>The petition was then handed up to the chairman,  who, having read it, submitted the following motion;&mdash;&quot;That to mark our  disapproval of the riotous conduct of a section of the spectators at the  final tie at Hampden Park on Saturday last, and to avoid the danger of  any repetition the cup competition for this season be now finished, and  the cup and medals be withheld.&quot; <br><br>This was seconded<br><br>ATTlTUDE OF THE CLUBS. <br>Mr  White, Celtic, said they might take it from him that the clubs would  not replay the match, and they would be acting according to their right  in refusing to play. He thought, therefore, it would, be in the best  interest of football if the meeting went unanimously with the petition. .  .<br><br>The chairman&#39;s motion and Mr Gibson&#39;s amendment were then put  to &quot; the meeting, when 15 voted for the former and 11 for the latter a  majority of 4 for the motion. The match will therefore not be replayed,  and the cup and badges will be withheld for the present season.<br><br> <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>Six classic matches: the birth of the Old Firm and the day Hampden burned<br></h3><br>http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/the-birth-of-the-old-firm-and-the-day-hampden-burned.116818757<br><br>Hugh Macdonald<br><br>Chief Sports Writer<br>.<br>Monday 26 January 2015 <br><br>THE violence started at 5pm. It did not abate until two hours later. <br><br>The South Side of Glasgow trembled to the noise of emergency vehicles, the groans of the injured and to the clamour of the rioters. Above all this hung a pall of smoke. Hampden was burning.<br><br>The scene, newspapers subsequently reported, resembled that of a battlefield.<br><br>It was April 17, 1909. Rangers and Celtic had drawn 1-1 in a replay after being locked at 2-2 the previous week. Fans rioted. Hundreds of supporters and police were injured. The cup was withheld.<br><br>There is debate and doubt about the causes of the mayhem. There is one certainty. It was not caused by sectarian tension but had more to do with the creation of the Old Firm, then seen as a mutually beneficial alliance to make money.<br><br>David Potter, a Celtic historian, says in his biography of Willie Maley, Celtic&#39;s manager at the time: &quot;Although Celtic were definitely the Catholic and Irish team of Scotland (and proud of it) Rangers had not yet involved themselves with the extreme Protestant cause.&quot;<br><br>So what happened to produce mayhem on the south side of Glasgow?<br><br>The accepted, most plausible version is that many of the supporters expected extra time to be played in the Scottish Cup final replay. They were outraged that after paying at least another shilling to watch a cup final they would be forced to reach into their pockets again before the cup was won.<br><br>Some may have believed the Old Firm were playing for a draw, conspiring to arrange another pay day when 60,000 fans would help fill their coffers. After all, that is how they achieved their monicker. The Scottish Referee periodical of April 16, 1904, carried a cartoon with a man with a sandwich board reading: &quot;Patronise the Old Firm, Rangers Celtic Ltd.&quot; It is the first recorded mention of the term. But many fans on that April day merely thought they had been bilked out of extra time.<br><br>More than 120,000 fans watched the final and the replay. Willie Maley, the manager of Celtic, was often heard to say that there was money in football. There was no dissent from the Rangers side.<br><br>The riot was almost certainly sparked by a misunderstanding. Maley undoubtedly wanted extra time to be played as his team faced fixture congestion in a run for a sixth consecutive Scottish championship. He had publicly asked for extra-time but Rangers and the SFA turned that request down. The refusal, though, was not publicised as heavily as Maley&#39;s request.<br><br>After Jimmy Quinn and Jimmy Gordon scored for Celtic and Rangers respectively, the match drifted towards a draw. It was a drab, almost anaemic affair and fans may have believed there was collusion to force another replay.<br><br>Their mood was not improved when at full-time there seemed to be indecision among both sets of players over whether to leave the field or to stay on for an extra- time that was not scheduled and, indeed, was not to be played.<br><br>Sports journalists assumed the role of war correspondents as trouble brewed and then boiled over. &quot;Large numbers of the vast crowd could hardly realise that the play was finished for the day and they stood awaiting the turn of events,&quot; reported the Glasgow Herald correspondent. He added: &quot;Presently a few individuals invaded the playing pitch, apparently more in a spirit of curiosity and mischief.&quot;<br><br>It escalated when a &quot;half intoxicated&quot; young man came on to the pitch and performed a dance in front of a policeman who knocked him to the ground and assaulted him.<br><br>Sensing further trouble was inevitable, Tom Maley, brother of Willie, grabbed the Scottish Cup and the receipts of &pound;1400 and took them to safety. The SFA announced a replay for Wednesday and some of the crowd made their way to the passage leading to the dressing-rooms.<br><br>Bottles and stones were launched but the rioters were foiled in their attempt to reach the dressing-rooms. They switched their focus to the rear of the covered stand and began dismantling it. Supporters began breaking up the goalposts before barriers were torn down and set on fire.<br><br>Baton charges and mounted surges by the police proved ineffective on the Hampden slopes.<br><br>&#39;&#39;Soon a huge bonfire was in progress, fed by fuel brought from every possible quarter,&quot; observed one reporter.<br><br>The entrances on Somerville Drive were also set on fire. Police and firemen came under attack. They picked up the missiles thrown at them and hurled them back,.<br><br>A reporter claimed that at one time there were 200 policemen on the field, including 16 horsemen.<br><br>Most of the injuries seemed to be result of being hit with stones or by batons. But some surgeons later reported knife wounds among the police casualties.<br><br>The battle began to abate about 7pm, two hours after it had exploded. It left a scene of destruction and blood. Hampden was left battered, bruised and smoking.<br><br>The crowd eventually dispersed and casualties were taken to by wagon to the Victoria Infirmary. Souvenirs were taken from the field of battle.<br><br>&quot;The crossbar of one of the goal posts was carried from the field into Somerville Road in front of the burning pay boxes and a crowd of men and boys hacked at it with pocket knives and pocketed the chips. Among the debris littering the ground was a number of policemen&#39;s helmets, which had been lost in the day&#39;s struggle. These were also the objective of the souvenir-hunter, being cut into strips and carried away,&quot; wrote a reporter.<br><br>&quot;Curious to relate only one man was arrested in the course of the outbreak,&quot; a newspaper reported on the Monday. &quot;He has been lodged in the Queen&#39;s Park Police Office and will be brought up to-day on a charge of assaulting a policeman and a soldier. It is stated that a plain clothes constable obtained the assistance of the soldier to effect the arrest. The police were, of course, practically powerless in the matter of apprehensions. Instances are recorded of rioters being taken into custody, but so savagely were the police handled that they were forced to let go their quarry.&quot;<br><br>There were, in fact, other arrests. The charges against two men accused of cutting up firemen&#39;s hoses were found not proven. The alleged attacker walked free, too. There was no retribution in court for the police.<br><br>It is impossible to record just how many were injured. More than 100 were thought to have been treated at the Victoria Infirmary but the records are sketchy. Medical staff placed the taking of notes secondary to staunching wounds. Similarly, many of those treated at the ground staggered home without being officially recorded as hurt.<br><br>As darkness settled on the battlefield , the scene was extraordinary. &quot;All over the pitch lay portions of the goalposts, netting and barriers, while at the exits and entrances the charred woodwork and twisted turnstiles showed that the fire brigade had not come too soon,&quot; reported the Glasgow Herald.<br><br>The inquest came quickly. On the Monday after the final, members of the Scottish Football Association strode into the offices at 6 Carlton Place, Glasgow, for an emergency meeting.<br><br>That day&#39;s newspapers had expressed outrage. The Glasgow Herald would state: &quot;Saturday was a black day in the history of football in Glasgow. The riot pales into insignificance every other happening, here and elsewhere on the football field. To equal it one must go back to the days of the Bread Riots in 1848.&quot;<br><br>The inquiry made little progress as to the cause. Both James Hay, the Celtic captain, and James Stark, his Rangers counterpart, said they had no instructions from their officials as to the playing of extra time.<br><br>The SFA, though, had to decide on the playing for the Scottish Cup. The Old Firm stood together. A joint statement for the clubs said: &quot;Although it was mooted during the week that extra time might be played in the event of a draw, it was found that the cup competition rules prevented this. On account of the regrettable occurrences of Saturday, both clubs agree to petition the association that the final tie be abandoned.&quot;<br><br>There was proposal made to replay the tie outside Glasgow but both clubs were adamant. One side would scratch rather than play another game.<br><br>The SFA came to a decision. The statement read: &quot;To mark the association&#39;s disapproval of the riotous conduct of a section of the supporters at Hampden Park, and to avoid a repetition, the cup competition for this season be finished and the cup and medals withheld.&quot;<br><br>The association gave Queen&#39;s Park &pound;500 towards repairs to the stadium and ordered the two clubs to pay &pound;150 as a penalty.<br><br>The Old Firm settled that account.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table> <br></div></div>
