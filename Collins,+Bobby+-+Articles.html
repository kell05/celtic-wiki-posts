It proved to be the  perfect place for a young lad interested in football as it was situated  between Cathkin Park and Hampden Park.   <br><br>I used to go and watch  lots of sides; Third Lanark, Celtic and Rangers. There were some  wonderful players to see and guys like Jimmy Mason, Jimmy Carabine and  Alex Venters were my favourites.<br><br>I started off playing in the  Life Boys when I was just eight. Then I moved on to the Boys&#39; Brigade.  As I became more interested and involved in the game, I started  concentrating on how the top players did things at matches. I looked at  how they moved and how they beat each other. Even then, every game I  played I wanted to win. Indeed, in every game I ever played in my life I  wanted to win.<br><br>Polmadie had a juvenile team and they asked me to  play when I was just a teenager. You were pitted against experienced  guys and it was a big step up. You had to get rid of the ball quickly or  get clattered. I learned that pretty quickly.<br><br>I left school when  I was 14 and became what was known as a scrap boy at the Empire  Aluminium Company. I worked hard at it and did well. But I left after  two years and became a shoe repairer. It was what a friend of mine was  doing and it was a far better number.<br><br>I joined Pollok Juniors  when I was 16. I was spotted playing for them by Everton and they soon  tried to sign me when I was 17. I even went down to Liverpool to see the  facilities and set-up there and was all set to move to England.<br><br>However,  the day before I was due to leave, the Celtic manager, Jimmy McGrory,  approached me and asked to sign me. I couldn&#39;t believe it. But I had  been something of a Celtic supporter - although I watched Third Lanark  as well as Rangers - and agreed to join them. They all had great  footballers and that was all that interested me. I joined when I was 17  in 1948. <br><br>I HAD never seen McGrory play. But my father had seen  him in his heyday in the 1920s and 1930s and told me what a marvellous  striker he was and about all the wonderful goals he scored. He was all  right and we got on fine. But he was not what you would term a coach. He  didn&#39;t say an awful lot to his players.<br><br>Alex Dowdalls, on the  other hand, was a very good physio and they left things up to him. We  did plenty of ball work but it was all after official training. The  sessions basically entailed a lot of laps of the stadium and sprints. We  used to run up and down the terracing steps. It was tough but it kept  you going when you were playing. In fact, I am over 70 now but can still  run.<br><br>MY first game was a tough one - it was against Rangers. But  we won it. I was up against Jock &#39;&#39;Tiger&#39;&#39; Shaw and had a smashing  game. I went out there thinking: &#39;&#39;I&#39;m going to run that old so-and-so  into the ground.&#39;&#39; It was the perfect start to my career.<br><br>&quot;I  remember going through the middle and Willie Wood fouled me and we got a  penalty. He moaned like hell, but he clipped me. Fortunately, we won  3-2 and I was never out of the team thereafter. When Celtic played  Rangers you simply had to win and it didn&#39;t matter how. If you didn&#39;t  win then you knew you wouldn&#39;t be able to go out for a while!&quot;<br><br>&quot;My  early games for Celtic went well and I soon settled into the team&#39;s  pattern of play &hellip; I was expected to play as a link man in attack as well  as a striker who had to get his share of goals. It was a challenge, but  if the manager thought I was capable of playing in that role then that  was fine by me.<br><br>&quot;There was no over complication in tactics. Talk  never centred on 4-2-4, 4-3-3, diamond formations or sweeper systems, we  believed in attacking football. That was our style of play. If we were  on the attack we&#39;d have five forwards and two wing-halves looking for  opportunities and supporting each other. If we were on the defensive  we&#39;d track back to support our defenders.<br><br>&quot;Of course, we had  players who could control a game; intelligent footballers like Bobby  Evans, Willie Fernie, Charlie Tully and John McPhail, and with players  of this calibre in the side changing tactics came natural to us and we  were able to adapt. If we had to battle we could and if we were able to  play our natural game we did.&quot;<br><br><b>I must be honest, the [Celtic v  Rangers] game never meant anything to me. Not in the way it does with  some fans. My father was a Catholic and my mother was a Protestant. I  grew up as a Protestant. But there were more Protestants than Catholics  at Celtic back then. Willie Fernie was another one. And Jock Stein, too.  Rangers, of course, had a different attitude for many, many years.</b><br><br>I  had attended Old Firm games as a supporter when I was a youngster and  had been taken aback by how ferocious things could get off the park.  Nothing ever really happened at the matches. But afterwards there were  always unpleasant incidents away from the grounds.<br><br>I played  against the likes of George &#39;&#39;Corky&#39;&#39; Young, Ian McColl, Sammy Cox, and  goalie Bobby Brown. Honestly, if these guys were playing the game today  every one of them would be worth millions and millions of pounds. That  is no exaggeration.<br><br>Although he was a Rangers man through and  through, one of the best pals I ever had was the late, great George  Young. I met him through the Morton manager, Hal Stewart. He used to run  Co-Operative Cigarettes functions. As a payment for turning up, players  got a few quid and as many fags as you could smoke. Hal was such a good  fellow.<br><br>WHEN I turned 21 I was due to be called up for National  Service. But I knew my football would be curtailed for two years. So, to  get out of it, I went and worked down a coal mine just outside  Dunfermline. I stuck that out for the time I was meant to be on service.  The people I met down the pits were all terrific folk.<br><br>I used to  train with Cowdenbeath during the week and then go back and train with  my Celtic team- mates one night a week and meet up with them for the  match at the weekend.<br><br>I weighed 9st 3lbs and was 5ft 4in high. I  played in a variety of positions. But I was probably best as an inside  forward. To my mind, nobody plays like I used to. I liked running  forward and shooting at goal. Then I would chase back and defend. That  just doesn&#39;t happen now. I scored hundreds of goals that way as well.<br><br>&quot;It  was really disappointing to miss out on the [1954] Cup final, but I was  delighted for the lads. I&#39;d been injured for around ten weeks, but  after battling back to fitness I&#39;d hoped to be in contention. It wasn&#39;t  to be though, and I couldn&#39;t complain because the team had played well  and reached the final without me. I had to wait for my chance to get  back into the first XI. I was just delighted to play and score in the  final League game two days after the Cup final and enjoyed all the  celebrations. Our fans were ecstatic. It was a wonderful achievement  because the team had been in inconsistent form for a number of years so  it was fantastic to put a run together. Overcoming Hearts was a great  effort by the squad.&quot;<br><br>Jock [Stein] was a great pal of mine. He  would go on to become a brilliant manager and lead Celtic to years of  unprecedented success. But he was an outstanding player as well. When he  came into the side he rejuvenated us. He was left-footed and slotted in  well on that side of the park, was excellent in the air and was a good  passer. We fed off him and started to win things again.<br><br>Some  supporters had threatened to boycott games if he was selected, which was  incredible. Jock may have been turning professional at the age of 28,  but you had to give him a chance. Fortunately the manager did give him  an opportunity and Jock soon settled into the team.<br><br>Jock read the  game well, could spot danger and opportunities quickly and as a player  we all respected him, but it was as a captain that you really saw his  credentials. He was always encouraging and demanding more effort, and  got it. Nobody escaped praise when it was warranted or a sharp word  where necessary.&quot;<br><br>Sean Fallon worked as his assistant and he was a  great bloke, too. He was a different kind of player altogether. When he  went in for a tackle he really went in for a tackle. It was just the  way he played. You have to have somebody who can look after themselves  on your side.<br><br>WILLIE Fernie was a smashing player for both Celtic  and Scotland. He was not what you would call ferocious. Fernie knew  what he was going to do and how to beat men. He was very clever. He  played at inside left or inside right or inside forward. <br><br>Bobby  Evans and I were great friends, too. He came from Pollokshaws, where I  lived for a long time, and we used to get the bus in to training. He was  a smashing chap and a brilliant player for Celtic, Chelsea and  Scotland. Indeed, he won a total of 48 caps. That was something else in  those days.<br><br>We won the League Championship, the League Cup and  the Scottish Cup during my time. But we weren&#39;t allowed to represent  Scotland in the European Cup. The Hibs chairman at the time was on the  SFA Committee and they were put forward to play in it instead. And they  reached the semi-final as well. It was a massive disappointment not  being allowed to go and play over there.<br><br>The hardest game I ever  played in was against European opposition in 1950. We played Lazio in  Rome in what was meant to be a friendly. But they were just vicious.  They kicked lumps out of me. We gave as good as we got. However, when we  got them back to Parkhead we annihilated them.<br><br>THE first time I  played for Scotland was against Wales down at Ninian Park back in 1952  when I was only 19 or 20. We won 2-1. There was no manager as such in  those days. But I think that was the match that Matt Busby came in and  took charge.<br><br>I scored quite a lot of goals for Scotland. In fact,  one of the best goals I ever scored was against West Germany in 1957  when we triumphed 3-1. I also netted a beauty against a good Polish  team. I think that, in total, I scored 12 goals in 31 games. That is not  a bad ratio.<br><br>I LEFT Celtic after nine years there in 1957. The  reason was simple - they wanted rid of me. I moved to Everton for about  (pounds) 25,000. I wasn&#39;t particularly happy about the transfer. They  sold Willie Fernie around about that time, too. He went down to  Middlesbrough for around (pounds) 20,000. With the money they got for  us, they covered the Celtic end of the ground. Consequently, that proved  to be a bad investment.<br><br>My last game in Scotland was against  Rangers for Morton at Ibrox. We won 2-0 and I scored the second goal. I  can remember their right-back got the ball. Their manager, Willie  Waddell, was shouting at him: &#39;Don&#39;t pass it back! Don&#39;t pass it back!&#39;  But he obviously didn&#39;t hear the instruction because he passed it back  and I picked up the ball.<br><br>I rounded the keeper and had an empty  net to put the ball into. I thought: &#39;Will I just tap it in? Oh, what  the hell!&#39; So I hammered it. It was a nice way to finish off my career  here.<br><br>I HAVEN&#39;T been back to see Celtic in a long, long time.  There is no-one on board who would remember me. Sir Robert Kelly was in  charge when I was a player there and he has gone now. He was a smashing  bloke. But I still like to watch them on television. In fact, I like  watching any game if the players are any good.<br><br>I watched the Old  Firm game that finished up 3-3 down here in England this season  [2002-2003]. Henrik Larsson is obviously a wonderful talent, but the guy  I really like in the game today is Neil Lennon. He works tirelessly,  always passes it to somebody in the clear and gets back well.<br><br>Bertie  Auld on Bobby Collins: &quot;Bobby Collins was a model footballer and a  major influence on me during my career. He was in the Celtic team when I  broke into first team football and was a member of the Scotland XI when  I won my first cap against Holland.<br><br>&quot;&quot;Bobby made me feel so  welcome at Celtic from the start. I remember him giving me his Adidas  boots from the 1958 World Cup finals. They were slightly big for him at  the time but they were my first major manufacturer&#39;s pair. I was the  envy of all the younger players breaking through in the squad! Bobby was  great with the young kids at Celtic. In the late Fifties there were no  full time coaches as such, we had a manager who selected the team,  although he was influenced by the chairman, and we had a physio.<br><br>The  coaches were the more experienced players. The club had a particular  dress code and Bobby looked the part both on and off the pitch. He was  always immaculately dressed and a model professional. Everyone admired  him.<br><br>&quot;We got on really well both on and off the park. Bobby made  you feel so important because he realised that the reserves today were  the first team players tomorrow. A number of us at the club, Billy  McNeill, Steve Chalmers and myself, went on to become part of the Lisbon  Lions. Others such as Pat Crerand starred at Manchester United. Bobby  helped us all.<br><br>&quot;On the park, if things were going wrong, he was  always encouraging and a great source of inspiration. It was brilliant  being in the same team as Bobby, but a nightmare for opponents! He never  stopped you from expressing yourself, and if you had a bad game or made  a mistake he would be the first to offer alternatives. You could not  help but admire him.<br><br>&quot;Bobby was a winner. He was also a manager&#39;s  dream because he could play in various positions, but in my opinion he  was devastating at inside-right. Bobby was physical and a wee bit robust  but he was not a dirty player. His all action game meant that he picked  up injuries that would have finished most players, but Bobby always  came back stronger, His strength of character was astonishing.<br><br>&quot;There  were so many games when Bobby had a major impact. I remember when  Celtic won 4-1 at Rangers in a Cup match. Bobby controlled the game from  start to finish; he was immense, and then in my first international  against Holland he was again outstanding. One other game that has to be  recalled was again against Rangers, this time in the 1957 League Cup  final, when we won 7-1. Unfortunately for me after playing in all the  earlier rounds, I missed out on that famous occasion and had to play in a  reserve match against Queen of the South, but I&#39;ve seen a film of the  game and it was one of those days when everything went right and Bobby  was at the hub of everything positive. He was incredible.<br><br>&quot;Whenever  Celtic supporters recall great stars from the Fifties, they nominate  the Wee Barra. The term &#39;legend&#39; is used far too much these days, but  not in the case of Bobby Collins, both as a team player and as an  individual. His name is up there with the very best, and I know it&#39;s the  same at both Everton and Leeds United where he was just as sensational.  <br><br>&quot;Bobby Collins could have graced a team in any era; he was one of British football&#39;s greatest stars.&quot;<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Bobby Collins Contract</h3>Pages <a class="external" href="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/Fczwe1CCNtthmehTq6_CFw314220" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">1</a>, <a class="external" href="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/oayhO098ElsMSyazLkvv4A332464" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2</a>, <a class="external" href="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/BAhxvnWEU1ZIV84YKzFeGw215906" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3</a>, <a class="external" href="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/3DRSyy0Mgtti89x33Uyemg296743" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">4</a>, <a class="external" href="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/MxZD7XO3FODUVFT1H8yoEw374186" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5</a><br><br><embed flashvars="transition=Fade&site=http://www.thecelticwiki.com&imageServer=http://image.wikifoundry.com&albumId=192926" height="400" src="http://wikifoundrytools.com/wiki/kds/widget/unknown/eeb0e479795efa9df04e6ed73a829d507bbada96" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" wmode="transparent"><br><br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>   Leeds United legend Bobby Collins has Alzheimer&#39;s                                                                                     		                           </h3><div class="editorialSectionLeft">                 <div class="byline">                                                                  <br>                       Published on Saturday 16 August 2008 08:41</div>                                                                                      <br>LEEDS United legend Bobby Collins is suffering from Alzheimer&#39;s disease.<br>                     			                                 <br>Bobby, 77, was diagnosed with the disease in 2002, the Yorkshire Evening Post can reveal.<br><br>The   man who helped kickstart the Don Revie revolution at United was cared   for at home in Alwoodley for the next four years by his devoted wife,   Betty.<br><br>Now, though, he is being looked after at a  Leeds-based  community hospital unit for people suffering from  Alzheimer&#39;s and  dementia.<br><br>Betty goes to see her husband every day while the couple&#39;s two children, Michael and Julie, call nearly as often.<br><br>Soccer   pals such as Noel Peyton, Peter Gunby and Joe Jordan also visit their   old friend, whose hospital room is decorated with pictures from his   footballing glory days.<br><br>Speaking publicly for the first  time  about her husband&#39;s illness, Betty told the YEP: &quot;Of course it&#39;s  hard  to accept that this is how he is now.<br><br>&quot;But I&#39;m pleased to say we are really happy with the care he is getting at the hospital.<br><br>&quot;The staff are wonderful &ndash; we couldn&#39;t ask for anything more.<br><br>&quot;One thing Bobby hasn&#39;t lost is his football skill.

He would go on to make a  total of 320 appearances, scoring an  impressive 116 goals, one of only  28 players to have scored over a  century of goals for Celtic.<br><br>   He played for the club at a time  when there a lot of great individuals  but the team were unable to find a  level of consistency that would  have delivered success on a regular  basis.<br><br>  However, Bobby  Collins was a central part of every one  of Celtic&rsquo;s post-war triumphs  prior to Jock Stein&rsquo;s arrival at the club  as manager.<br><br>  He was  part of the team which won the Scottish Cup  in 1951, beating Motherwell  1-0 in the final, while he helped the Hoops  win the one-off St Mungo  Cup in August of the same year, beating  Aberdeen 3-2 at Hampden.<br><br>   Another one-off trophy was secured in  1953 as Celtic unexpectedly won  the Coronation Cup, beating Hibernian  2-0 in the final. On their way  to Hampden, the Hoops beat Arsenal 1-0,  with Collins scoring the only  goal of the game direct from a corner,  before seeing off Manchester  United 2-1 in the semi-final<br><br>  And  in the subsequent season  1953/54, Celtic won the league and cup double,  with The Wee Barra  playing a pivotal role in the heart of the Celtic  midfield.<br><br>  He  also played his part in Celtic&rsquo;s first two League  Cup triumphs. In  1956/57, he scored the first goal in the 3-0 replay  victory over  Partick Thistle, and a year later he was part of the  legendary Celtic  team which beat Rangers 7-1 to retain the trophy. <br><br>Bobby  Collins  was transferred to Everton in 1958 &ndash; there were rumours that  the deal  was done to finance new floodlights for Celtic Park &ndash; and he  remained  at Goodison for five years before joining Leeds United, then in  the  English Second Division.<br><br>  As captain he helped them gain   promotion to the old First Division, and was awarded the English   Football Writers&rsquo; Player of the Year in 1965 in recognition of his   contribution as Leeds finished runners-up in both the league and FA Cup   that season, ensuring his place as a legendary figure with the  Yorkshire  club.<br><br>  A serious injury the following season in a  European tie  effectively called time on his top-flight career. He was  also capped 31  times for Scotland, scoring 10 goals, <br><br>  Bobby  Collins was a true  Celtic legend and one of Scotland&rsquo;s all-time great  players. His  contribution to the success of both Celtic and Leeds  United is testament  to that.<br><br>  The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Celtic are with Bobby&rsquo;s family and friends at this very sad time.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>Bobby Collins: Tributes to former Celtic, Everton and Leeds player</h3>BBC<br>Former Celtic, Everton, Leeds United and Scotland midfielder Bobby Collins has died, aged 82.<br><br>Standing at just 5ft 3in, Collins became known as &quot;The Wee Barra&quot;

The  following season saw  Leeds make a spectacular return to the top  division. They finished  runners-up, as they also did in the FA Cup, and  Collins was voted  footballer of the year.<br><br>At little over 5ft 3in,  but  unrelentingly hard, Collins was as abrasive as he was creative. In  the  1965 Cup final at Wembley, against Liverpool, he broke the  collarbone  of the Liverpool full-back Gerry Byrne, who somehow played on   (substitutions were not then permitted). Leeds too were diminished by   injury to the midfielder Jim Storrie. There was a thrilling climax in   the first extra-time period played in a final since 1947. Byrne, despite   his injury, pulled the ball back from the goal-line for Roger Hunt to   head Liverpool into the lead.

However, Collins managed to return after a complex  operation  for the last three matches of the season. The following  season, he  received another injury, and transferred to Bury in February  1967.<br><br>Collins  was born in Glasgow and worked as a miner and  cobbler from the age of  14. He recalled: &quot;Football was a wonderful  life, but I found working  outside the game interesting and challenging  too.&quot; Going down the mine,  he once remarked, had the further advantage  of keeping him out of the  army, in those days of conscription. Playing  for Glasgow Boys, he was  signed by Celtic, making his debut for them on  the right wing in the  1949-50 season. His second season with Celtic  saw him win his first  three international caps. Altogether, he would  play 220 League games for  Celtic, scoring 80 goals. Crossing the border  to join Everton in 1958,  he had already modulated into an  inside-forward.<br><br>In the Swedish  World Cup of 1958, he was a  member of a Scotland side which, as he later  remarked, was bizarrely  without managerial leadership, though it did  not disgrace itself.  Indeed, to draw their first game at V&auml;ster&aring;s with a  Yugoslavia team  which had recently thrashed England 5-0 in Belgrade was  no small feat.  Collins played at inside-left in that game, and  inside-right in the  second match in Norrk&ouml;ping, scoring Scotland&#39;s  second goal in a 3-2  defeat by Paraguay.<br><br>The third and last game  came in &Ouml;rebro  against the powerful French side that would eventually  take third  place, inspired by the attacking combination of Raymond Kopa  and Just  Fontaine, both of whom scored in a narrow French victory.  Collins that  day played in his original role of outside-right.<br><br>He  stayed  productively at Everton until 1961-62, making 133 League  appearances  and scoring 42 goals. Midway through that season, however,  he dropped  down a division to join Leeds. He might well instead have  moved across  the city to Liverpool, whose manager, a fellow Scot, Bill  Shankly,  wanted him. But the first time Shankly phoned him, Collins was  out and  his brother-in-law couldn&#39;t make out who it was. By the time  Shankly  phoned again, Collins had agreed to join Leeds.<br><br>After  leaving  Leeds, he helped Bury to reach the Second Division. Later there  was a  spell in Scotland with Morton, another in Dublin with Shamrock  Rovers,  and a stint at Oldham Athletic, as player-coach. His subsequent   managerial career was varied, and somewhat ill-starred. In August 1974   he became manager of Huddersfield Town, then in the Third Division, but   that ended in December 1975, by which time his job had been made   impossible by the board&#39;s intransigence. It was, he said, &quot;a nightmare&quot;.<br><br>After   Huddersfield, he became chief coach, caretaker and manager, and   finally, in October 1977, the manager of Hull City, but the job lasted   only until the following February, when he was dismissed. In the interim   he had returned to Leeds United as youth coach.<br><br>For the next   couple of years he was forced on to the dole, then worked variously as   principal of a coaching school, &quot;in the rag trade, chauffeuring and   being a bit of a messenger boy. I enjoyed that.&quot; Finally, his former   Leeds team-mate Norman Hunter made him youth and reserve team coach at   Barnsley. When Hunter left, Collins became the new manager, after a   spell as caretaker, in February 1984.<br><br>But, just back from taking   the players for a holiday in Majorca in what seemed a fruitful spell  for  the club, he was dismissed once again, with a year of his contract   left, in June 1985. &quot;I thought I had done a good job,&quot; he said. &quot;At the   time, the miners&#39; strike was having a bad effect on the local economy,   gates were down, and if you spent &pound;50,000 on a player, it was big   money.&quot;<br><br>Later, he worked with a friend in wholesale fashion, then   for some years as a driver for Leeds University. In 2002, he was   diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s.<br><br>He had two children, Michael and Julie, with his wife, Betty. 						 						 						 					<table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>  Bobby Collins obituary</h3>Scotland, Celtic, Everton and Leeds footballer described by Don Revie as &#39;the best signing I ever made&#39;<br><br> Brian Glanville <br> The Guardian, Tuesday 14 January 2014 16.40 GMT <br><br>Bobby Collins playing in 1955.<br>Bobby Collins playing in 1955.

Collins played at inside-left in that game, and  inside-right in the second match in Norrk&ouml;ping, scoring Scotland&#39;s  second goal in a 3-2 defeat by Paraguay.<br><br>The third and last game  came in &Ouml;rebro against the powerful French side that would eventually  take third place, inspired by the attacking combination of Raymond Kopa  and Just Fontaine, both of whom scored in a narrow French victory.  Collins that day played in his original role of outside-right.<br><br>He  stayed productively at Everton until 1961-62, making 133 League  appearances and scoring 42 goals. Midway through that season, however,  he dropped down a division to join Leeds. He might well instead have  moved across the city to Liverpool, whose manager, a fellow Scot, Bill  Shankly, wanted him. But the first time Shankly phoned him, Collins was  out and his brother-in-law couldn&#39;t make out who it was. By the time  Shankly phoned again, Collins had agreed to join Leeds.<br><br>After  leaving Leeds, he helped Bury to reach the Second Division. Later there  was a spell in Scotland with Morton, another in Dublin with Shamrock  Rovers, and a stint at Oldham Athletic, as player-coach. His subsequent  managerial career was varied, and somewhat ill-starred. In August 1974  he became manager of Huddersfield Town, then in the Third Division, but  that ended in December 1975, by which time his job had been made  impossible by the board&#39;s intransigence. It was, he said, &quot;a nightmare&quot;.<br><br>After  Huddersfield, he became chief coach, caretaker and manager, and  finally, in October 1977, the manager of Hull City, but the job lasted  only until the following February, when he was dismissed. In the interim  he had returned to Leeds United as youth coach.<br><br>For the next  couple of years he was forced on to the dole, then worked variously as  principal of a coaching school, &quot;in the rag trade, chauffeuring and  being a bit of a messenger boy. I enjoyed that.&quot; Finally, his former  Leeds team-mate Norman Hunter made him youth and reserve team coach at  Barnsley. When Hunter left, Collins became the new manager, after a  spell as caretaker, in February 1984.<br><br>But, just back from taking  the players for a holiday in Majorca in what seemed a fruitful spell  for the club, he was dismissed once again, with a year of his contract  left, in June 1985. &quot;I thought I had done a good job,&quot; he said. &quot;At the  time, the miners&#39; strike was having a bad effect on the local economy,  gates were down, and if you spent &pound;50,000 on a player, it was big  money.&quot;<br><br>Later, he worked with a friend in wholesale fashion,  then for some years as a driver for Leeds University. In 2002, he was  diagnosed with Alzheimer&#39;s.<br><br>He had two children, Michael and Julie, with his wife, Betty.<br><br>&bull; Robert Young Collins, footballer and manager, born 16 February 1931; died 13 January 2014  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  </h3><h3>  </h3><h3>  Why Celtic must never forget legends like &lsquo;Wee Barra&rsquo; Bobby Collins</h3>Wednesday 15 Jan 2014 2:57 pm<br>Metro.com<br><br>Why Celtic fans must not forget CollinsBobby <br><br>Celtic supporters have long had a tendency to talk in detail about players from the distant past who have appeared for the club.<br><br>Such a trait no doubt comes from the club&rsquo;s unique Irish hinterland and a willingness to keep yesteryear fresh in the mind.<br><br>Foremost  among those &lsquo;Celtic Greats&rsquo; is John Thomson, the young Scotland  goalkeeper tragically killed diving at the feet of a Rangers striker in  the 1930s.<br><br>Then there&rsquo;s &lsquo;Peerless&rsquo; Patsy Gallacher, Charlie  Tully and the incomparable Jimmy McGrory. There will also have been much  discussion down the years of Bobby Collins who has died aged 82.<br><br>Known  as the &lsquo;Wee Barra&rsquo; because he stood only 5ft 3inches tall, Collins had  the visage of a boxer, with a terrier-like character to match.<br><br>A  native of Glasgow, he made his debut in August 1949, aged just 18,  delighting the 70,000 crowd by tormenting the Rangers veteran Jock Shaw.<br><br>Collins, who would score over a century of goals in 320 appearances, never looked back.<br>Football  Match 1965: Fulham v Leeds 2-2. Bobby Collins and Bobby Robson in  action . His reputation was built on energy and endeavor and the  undoubted fact that he carried an erratic Celtic throughout much of the  1950s.<br><br>Premier among his achievements was a Scottish Cup Final  win in 1951 and a wholly unexpected triumph in the Coronation Cup two  years later, with Collins scoring the only goal of the semi-final  against Arsenal direct from a corner.<br><br>He also played a major part in the League and Cup double of 1954 and the back-to-back League Cup wins of 1956 and 57.<br><br>The  latter of these was the record 7-1 &lsquo;Hampden in the Sun&rsquo; defeat of  Rangers; an appearance which by itself guaranteed eternal legend status.<br><br>With Arsenal also interested, Collins was sold in 1958 to Everton.<br><br>It  was not a happy departure from the east end of Glasgow, with Celtic by  all accounts cashing in their major asset in order to fund a new  floodlighting system.<br><br>Their loss was to be the Toffees&rsquo; gain but  it was with Leeds United, from 1963, that he really sparkled, helping  them to win promotion to the old First Division.<br><br>Reflecting on  his passing former team-mate Eddie Gray described Collins as the &lsquo;most  influential player in the history of Leeds.&rsquo;<br><br>There were 31  Scotland caps too, the last three of these came in 1965 after a gap of  six years. It was a comeback typical of the man and his considerable  ability.<br><br>Small in stature he may have been, but big in the history of the game he will remain.  <br><br><br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br></embed></div></div>
