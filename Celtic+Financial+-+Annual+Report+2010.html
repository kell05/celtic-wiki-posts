We invested significantly in the playing  squad, particularly in the January registration window. Even although we  knew then that we had a formidable task ahead in coming from behind and  recovering the points deficit at that time, we had a clear sense of  purpose - recovery of the SPL title. But regrettably, we fell short of  that objective. Neither cup competition provided any comfort.  The unacceptable results on the football pitch meant that  a change in the football management team was needed. Some pride was  then restored from an unbeaten run in the SPL at the end of the season,  with Neil Lennon taking temporary charge. But that does not in any way  compensate for the extreme disappointment and frustration we and all  Celtic supporters felt last season. It was simply not good enough for  this Club and those who support it.  Fortunately, the relatively strong financial position we  have insisted in maintaining in recent years has enabled us to continue  to rebuild even after last year&#39;s set-back. Last year we signed or took  on loan 13 new players. Already, under our new management in the new  financial year, we have brought in 7 new faces and will continue to seek  to enhance our football squad.  But just as football and financial strength are essential  partners in progress, so too they affect each other adversely when we  are not succeeding as we should.  Thus the combination of the financial/economic recession  and disappointing football results have taken their toll in this year&#39;s  report. Our turnover at &pound;61.72m was well down on &pound;72.59m the previous  year. This was predominantly the effect of participation in UEFA Europa  League rather than UEFA Champions League but also due to a lower level  of season ticket sales, reduced merchandising revenues from one kit  launch rather than two, and a drop in domestic media income following  the demise of Setanta.  Operating expenses also fell, by &pound;4.10m, to &pound;57.25m  leading to a profit from trading before asset transactions and  exceptional items, of &pound;4.46m. But after taking account of the extensive  changes in playing staff, amortisation on players, a small loss on  disposal and allowing for exceptional operating expenses of &pound;3.14m, we  have experienced a loss before taxation of &pound;2.13m, against a profit of  &pound;2.00m the year before.  Our year end bank debt, net of cash is &pound;5.85m, sustainable  but up on &pound;1.51m the year before. This is reflective, in part, of the  hefty investment made in football personnel during the year - &pound;13.64m -  significantly higher than the &pound;8.53m of 2009. Not surprisingly, against a  backdrop of a substantial decrease in overall revenue, our ratio of  total labour costs to turnover has risen from 53.4% to 59.11%, although  our absolute wage cost of &pound;38.75m in 2009 reduced to &pound;36.48m in 2010.  When considered in the context of the season that we had,  and the changes that had to be made as a result of poor football  results, this outcome, heavily influenced by exceptional costs, is not  overly disappointing. But we must try to ensure that it is not repeated  in the coming year. That will not be straightforward.  Some of the major factors that are likely to affect our  business, such as the economic environment and consumer confidence, are  not within our control. Such difficult economic times make even more  important our charitable work and the work that we as a Club continue to  do in the community, including in some of the most deprived areas.  But the economic context of Scottish football obviously also has a  direct commercial impact on the Club and our supporters. Season tickets  sales were down on the record of 54,252 the year before, and the Board  believes this trend is set to continue this year, notwithstanding the  continuing ticket price freeze, maintenance of concessionary schemes and  the new instalment plans.  Our financial strength and management of resources have  stood us in good stead to date and we aim to ensure that remains the  case, investing where and when we can and taking up new opportunities  when they arise. At the time of writing 7 new first team players have  joined, and 3 have departed. Our new contract with Tennent&#39;s as our  shirt sponsor commenced on 1 July, as did the 5 year extension with  NIKE, renewal with our online retail partner Kitbag, and a new vehicle  sponsor agreement with another blue-chip brand, Lomond Audi.  But the general picture of a constrained economic  environment places a further premium on success throughout our scouting,  sports science and Academy development. In the coming year our trading  will also be put under greater pressure than has been the case for some  time, and the performance of our football management team and players  will be placed under even more scrutiny than normal.  But one great feature of football, and this great Club, is  that each new season provides an opportunity to put past failures  behind us, to learn from them and restore our place as Scottish  champions. That is precisely what we aim to do with a new football  management team under Neil Lennon, a revitalised playing squad and  crucially, your support, for which I once again thank you on behalf of  everyone at the Club.  Dr John  Reid  13 August 2010 Chairman<br><h3 class="lb"><br></h3><h3>CHIEF EXECUTIVE&#39;S REVIEW <br></h3><h3><br></h3><u><b>INTRODUCTION</b></u><br> Put simply, 2009/10 failed to generate the football  results we had all hoped that a new football managerial team and  substantial investment in players would bring. The overhaul of the  playing squad and adoption of a different ideology into an embryonic  first team yielded little reward, with the senior side ultimately unable  to capture a major trophy.  However, the appointment of Neil Lennon, a Celtic legend  and former captain, supported by Johan Mjallby as Assistant Manager,  Alan Thompson and Garry Parker have raised morale and renewed optimism. <u><b><br></b></u> <u><b>FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE</b></u>  As was noted in last year&#39;s review much of the football  sector continues to be challenged financially. Many clubs are heavily  in debt, have seen revenues shrinking and are incurring ongoing  losses. Lucrative television contracts in the English Premier League  have resulted in wage and transfer fee inflation in the UK and also  around Europe that is clearly becoming unsustainable.  Trading conditions have been and continue to be extremely  difficult. This is reflected in Celtic&#39;s trading results for the year to  30 June 2010, which reflect participation in the UEFA Europa League as  compared to the more lucrative Champions League Group Stage last year.  In the year to 30 June 2010 turnover reduced to &pound;61.72m,  with total operating expenses falling by approximately &pound;4.10m, 6.7% to  &pound;57.25m. Much of this cost saving is as a result of a reduction in cost  of sales, labour, utilities and other operational overheads. This is  the second successive year of overhead savings as tight control is  exercised over costs in an environment of declining revenues.  Nevertheless, during the financial year to 30 June 2010,  &pound;13.64m was invested in strengthening the first team squad and  management team. In addition a gain on sale of &pound;5.71m resulted from the  sales of Caldwell, Donati, Fox, McDonald and Robson. This compared to  &pound;1.55m last year. Exceptional costs of &pound;3.14m were incurred in  comparison to &pound;2.78m last year. This in the main relates to costs  associated with the early termination of certain employment contracts.  As a result of the above, and after these exceptional  costs, the Company announced a retained loss for the year to 30 June  2010 of &pound;2.13m which compares with the previous year&#39;s profit of &pound;2.00m.  Further details can be found in the Director&#39;s Review. <u><b><br></b></u> <u><b>FOOTBALL INVESTMENT</b></u>  Planned acquisitions and sales of  players and the development of younger players continue to be integral  elements of the Club&#39;s long-term strategy. As in recent seasons all new  signings and contract extensions must be at a financially viable  level.   New signings included Marc-Antoine  Fortune, Lukas Zaluska, Dominic Cervi, Josh Thompson, Morten Rasmussen,  Paul Slane, Ki Sung Yueng, Jos Hooiveld and Thomas Rogne. In addition,  loan signings included Landry N&#39;Guemo, Edson Braafheid, Diomansy Kamara  and the much-heralded Robbie Keane.  Departures in season 2009/10 included  Scott Cuthbert, Massimo Donati, Willo Flood, Daniel Fox, Scott McDonald,  Barry Robson and Gary Caldwell, whilst other players went out on loan  deals, including Stephen McManus, Darren O&#39;Dea and Cillian Sheridan.  Some contracts were not extended upon expiry, including those of Zheng  Zhi and Lee Naylor.  21 members of Celtic&#39;s first team squad  received senior international call-ups during the course of the 2009/10  season, spanning a dozen nations, with Ki Sung Yueng and Georgios  Samaras both acquitting themselves admirably at the World Cup in South  Africa.  The Club plans to further strengthen the first team squad  under Neil Lennon, whilst continuing to manage our financial resources  responsibly. The signings of Charlie Mulgrew, Daryl Murphy, Gary Hooper,  Biram Kayal, Cha Du-Ri, fellow World Cup participant Efrain Juarez and  highly regarded Welsh Internationalist Joe Ledley prior to the start of  the new campaign signal the Club&#39;s intent. Meanwhile former mainstays  Stephen McManus and Artur Boruc departed in the Summer. The Club wishes  them well and thanks them for their respective contributions. <br> <u><b>FOOTBALL OPERATIONS</b></u>  During season 2009/10 the Club played 54 competitive first team matches, winning 31, drawing 9 and losing 14.  There was no &#39;Reserve&#39; Scottish Premier  League competition last season. As a result, the first team player pool  incorporated players previously classified as reserve team players.  This provided the Club with the opportunity to develop and train such  players by organizing and playing &#39;behind closed door&#39; matches with top  sides in England, Ireland and Scotland on a regular basis.  <br> <u><b>YOUTH ACADEMY</b></u>  There were a number of structural and personnel changes  during the course of season 2009/10, which saw a continuation of the  success enjoyed in recent years by Celtic&#39;s youth teams.  The Under 19s won the SPL Youth League title and beat  Rangers in the final of the SFA Youth Cup, with a number of young  players earning international honours and graduating to the first team  squad during the season. They also finished as runners-up to Liverpool  following a penalty shootout in the prestigious Villarreal Tournament.  Our Under 17s also performed well in 2009/10 whilst our  Intermediate Under 15 and Under 13 sides went through the season  undefeated.  At the Junior level we introduced new teams at Under 8 and  9 age groups, whilst in June our Under 12 team won a European Trophy in  the Czech Republic. <br> <u><b>TICKET SALES</b></u> <br>Season 2009/10 was a challenging one for  the Ticket Office, although over 48,000 standard season tickets were  sold with a value of more than &pound;16million.   Match ticket sales of over 240,000 generated revenue in  excess of &pound;6.5million, whilst the sale of tickets for both Champions  League and Europa League matches accounted for over 210,000 ticket sales  at a value of &pound;4.7million. <br> <u><b>CELTIC DEVELOPMENT</b></u>  Around &pound;760,000 was donated to Celtic Football Club&#39;s  Development Division from Celtic Development Pools for the purposes of  youth development, whilst supporters from all over the country won  nearly &pound;1million in prize money.  The weekly Celtic Pool lottery continues to out perform  most football club and charitable lottery products in this challenging  environment, continuing the substantial donation again this year. We are  grateful to the Directors and staff of that organisation for their  continued support.  Supporters have benefitted too: the Paradise Windfall  match day lottery continues to be very popular, with a top prize of  &pound;9,000 on offer. Prize money of approximately &pound;2.1million has now been  paid out to Celtic supporters on the pitch at Celtic Park since the  start of the Windfall in 1995. <br> <u><b>CELTIC FOUNDATION</b></u>  The Celtic Foundation continues to promote the Club&#39;s  social dimension, reflecting the reasons Celtic came into being in the  1880s. It incorporates the following key strands:  <ul><li>&sect; Charitable work</li><li>&sect; Celtic learning programmes</li><li>&sect; Community coaching programmes</li><li>&sect; Community Academies aimed at children, youths and adults</li><li>&sect; Celtic women&#39;s teams</li><li>&sect; &#39;Sport for Life&#39; programmes</li></ul>      We are delighted to have the support of Billy Connolly as  Patron of the Celtic Foundation and Elaine C. Smith as Patron on the  Celtic girls&#39; and women&#39;s programme.  The Club&#39;s community programme has attracted over  2,500,000 young people and adults from throughout Scotland, Ireland and  beyond in the 7 years since its inception. Currently over 6,500  participants attend programmes run by The Celtic Foundation each week.  Currently 50 Community Academy teams operate throughout  Scotland. The aim is to establish a further 15 teams during season  2010/11. This &#39;Play for Celtic&#39; programme also operates as a scouting  cell for the Club with around 35 youngsters having graduated from the  Community Academy into the Celtic Youth Academy in recent years.  In addition the Foundation has a number of specialist projects which focus on:  <ul><li>&sect; Health and wellbeing</li><li>&sect; Lifelong learning</li><li>&sect; Safer communities</li><li>&sect; Unemployment</li></ul>    These activities are indicative of the importance Celtic  attaches to its role in the community. The Celtic Foundation reinforces  that role and the importance the Club attaches to working alongside key  partners to deliver key policy direction set by local and central  government.  The Celtic Foundation currently runs community sports  programmes in football, basketball, netball and athletics for primary  and secondary school pupils throughout Glasgow. The main aim of these  programmes is to encourage young people to live a healthier lifestyle.  The Girls&#39; Academy and Women&#39;s senior teams represent the  most sought after programme in the country for female footballers. The  progress made in the past year has been outstanding with successes at  all levels, the latest of which have been winning the Premier League Cup  and Football League Cup. <br> <u><b>MERCHANDISING</b></u>  Merchandising revenue for the year reached &pound;15.50m. This  was 9.8% down on the previous year, mainly due to the timing of kit  launches. The &#39;bumble bee&#39; away kit was a huge success, making it one of  our best selling strips ever. New home and away kits are being launched  for the coming season.  We opened a new retail unit in Braehead during the year, taking our total number of outlets to 15.  The sale of personalised bricks continued to be a strong  performer and these can now be purchased for the prestigious tunnel  area. Meanwhile this Autumn will see the release of an official  biography of Jimmy Johnstone and the complete Henrik Larsson and an  updated John Hartson story on DVD. <br> <u><b>MULTI MEDIA </b></u> Channel 67, the Club&#39;s online portal to live matches, is now in its 12th  year and continues to provide live quality streams of Celtic matches to  the world wide fan base. In addition to live games, in January the Club  brought the daily magazine programme &#39;The Huddle&#39; to Channel 67 as &#39;The  Huddle Online&#39;.  The official Club website, Celticfc.net, is currently  being revamped after three years in its present form and will be  re-launched in Autumn 2010 to include new functionality and social  networking facilities. <br> <u><b>PUBLIC RELATIONS</b></u>  Once again, the Club experienced a high level of media  interest and activity throughout the year across domestic and European  football.  The Club&#39;s PR Department continued to achieve and manage a  substantial level ofhigh profile media coverage for a range of Club  activities at a national level, includingcommercial, charitable and  community events.  The PR Department also acts as an important liaison  between the Club and supporters&#39; organisations, assisting with supporter  enquiries and requirements.  In addition, the Department liaises directly with a number  of organisations to ensure that through a range of initiatives the Club  upholds its important social dimension <br> <u><b>BRAND PROTECTION</b></u>  The Club continued to protect the Celtic brand worldwide  to prevent unauthorised use by third parties, to ensure that the brand  remains a valuable Club asset, and protect our supporters from  sub-standard goods and services.  Counterfeit goods to the value of approximately &pound;400,000  were removed from the marketplace during the year, along witha number  of websites found to be offering unofficial Celtic goods and services. <br> <u><b>PARTNER PROGRAMME</b></u>  Despite a tough economic environment, which finds many big  clubs and competitions still looking for sponsors, we are delighted to  welcome Tennent&#39;s as our new shirt sponsor. Tennent&#39;shave been involved  in Scottish footballfor the past 36 years and we look forward to  working with this prestigious Scottish brand over the coming years.  In July this year we were also delighted to announce Lomond Audi Group as the Club&#39;s new Official Vehicle Sponsor.  The sponsorship market continues to be difficult but with  blue chip partners such as Nike, Tennent&#39;s, Thomas Cook, Bank of  America, Lomond Audi and others we have a strong base as we continue to  look for new opportunities. <br> <u><b>STADIUM</b></u>  Spectator safety remains of paramount importance for fans attending matches both home and away.During  the course of the year Celtic continued to work in close partnership  with Glasgow City Council&#39;s Safety Team for Sports Grounds, placing  spectator safety as our highest priority.  The training of colleagues responsible for public safety  duties continued. Those responsible for the management of spectator  safety are now qualified and accredited in compliance with industry  guidelines and the training of safety stewards continues to be  prioritised. Protectevent stewards participated in a new accredited  training programme leading to an SVQ qualification in Event Stewarding.  In addition, the Club continued to provide an input to the Match  Commander&#39;s training programme, held at the Scottish Police College.  During the course of the year the Club was delighted to  host three major exercises and seminars specifically aimed at enhancing  spectator safety. The seminars were delivered in partnership with the  Strathclyde Emergencies Coordination Group, Strathclyde Police and the  Football Safety Officers Association (Scotland). <br> <u><b>FACILITIES</b></u>  The Facilities department undertook a number of  maintenance and refurbishment projects during another busy year,  including corporate lounges and hospitality areas as well as retail  outlets and at the training ground in Lennoxtown. Members of the team  advanced their own professional skills and competence by securing  related industry qualifications.  Further streamlining of purchasing procedures resulted in  significant improvements in efficiency and cost reduction, and the  introduction of enhanced procedural controls.  Special mention must be made of the quality of our playing  surface at Celtic Park. Grass cover was maintained at a very high level  during one of the worst winters for some years. Our SGL lighting system  has certainly played a part in maintaining pitch standards, whilst  construction of an additional training pitch at Lennoxtown is now  nearing completion. In November 2009 the Celtic groundstaff were  recognised with two industry awards: one for Premier League Pitch of the  Year and the other for our Head Groundsman John Hayes as Professional  Groundsman of the Year. <br> <u><b>CATERING AND CORPORATE HOSPITALITY </b></u> This season was particularly challenging as organisations  booking venues for conferences reined back spending. As a result the  number of attendees for conference and banqueting events was lower than  in previous years. Potential cuts in public spending in the coming year  also mean that trading conditions will remain difficult for some time to  come.  However, the Number 7 Restaurant continued to perform well  for Sunday lunches and the Children&#39;s Menu received a Gold  accreditation from the Soil Association as part of their Food For Life  scheme.  On match days our stadium operator Lindley Catering has  experienced a reduction in their revenue stream due to lower  attendances, although sales in the cash areas located within the  hospitality lounges performed well.  Celtic achieved special recognition at the official  football hospitality awards where we were overall winner for match day  experience in Scotland.  Despite a drop in group bookings from Ireland and fewer  school group tours, the Visitor Centre remains popular, with visitors  including various Celtic supporter clubs from Italy, Spain and Germany. <br> <u><b>SUPPORTER RELATIONS</b></u>  Our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system  continues to bring supporter information from many different business  areas into one database, and is used to support both the Club&#39;s  marketing activities and those of our sponsors in a targeted,  cost-effective manner.  The number of supporters&#39; details held in the database has continued to grow, with a 24% increase in contacts over the year.  We intend to implement new elements over the next few  months to provide increased functionality and sophistication in areas  such as e-mail marketing, while also reducing operating costs.  <br>  <u><b>CELTIC CHARITY FUND</b></u>  The Charity Fund is a charitable trust, independent of the  Club, which was founded to provide support for those in society in  great need and upholding the values for which the Club itself was  founded, We congratulate the Charity Fund&#39;s Trustees on another very  successful year and are happy to include a detailed report on the  Fund&#39;s activities on pages 61 to 64 to assist in publicising the work that it does.   The Club is proud to have been able to assist Celtic  Charity Fund again during the year, hosting the Club Couture Show,  Charity Abseil, Charity Cup, ribbon day and annual sporting dinner. <br> <u><b>HUMAN RESOURCES</b></u>  As a consequence of the economic downturn, salaries were  frozen for a second successive year and we embarked on a limited  rationalisation programme to reduce our fixed employment costs and  increase flexibility. A small number of job losses were a regrettable  but unavoidable consequence of this exercise.  However, despite a difficult financial climate shared by  many other businesses, we remain committed to developing colleagues and  becoming an employer of choice. We continue to invest in training and  technology, remuneration and benefits are regularly reviewed and  benchmarked, and employee welfare remains an important consideration.  Another 33 pupils from local schools enjoyed a week of  structured work experience at Celtic Park during the year. This is a  highly successful ongoing programme open to all, which has received  plaudits from pupils, parents and the education authorities.  The hard work and contribution of all colleagues in a particularly busy and difficult year is greatly appreciated. <br> <u><b>SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK</b></u>  We as the second placed club in the SPL had to negotiate  the qualifying rounds of the UEFA Champions League once again. We  entered the competition at qualifying round 3 with a very difficult tie  against SC Braga of Portugal. Across the two legs we failed to overcome  Braga and therefore now look to qualify for the UEFA Europa League.  Results on the pitch continue to be the major influence on  trading performance. Our failure to recapture the Scottish Premier  League title last year, and its impact on European qualification, had a  detrimental effect on our profit performance in 2009/10. Nevertheless,  sensible cost management and effective financial controls, in addition  to the gains reported from player trading, mitigated the negative  impact, resulting in reasonable financial results from underlying  trading, before assets transactions and exceptional items again for the  year to 30 June 2010, though much reduced on last year.  Revenues generated by progress in European competitions  remain of major significance and provide greater flexibility when  considering player investment.  Trading at the beginning of the new financial year has  been challenging in a difficult market place. We look to maximise  revenues and develop the Celtic brand, which together with the ongoing  management of costs should enable us to maintain a sustainable business  model.  It is imperative that we re-establish domestic success and  compete successfully, particularly in the Clydesdale Bank Scottish  Premier league. The gap with major European nations widens and the cost  of attracting quality new players is a significant factor. Although  better placed in financial terms than many clubs, careful and patient  use of our financial resources must characterise our efforts to  strengthen the first team squad.  Since the beginning of the new financial year we have  invested sizeable sums in enhancing our first team squad. As well as  bringing in additional talent, we have acquired a number of exciting  young players with valuable potential for further development.  We will continue to invest strategically on our technical  functions, talent identification, Academy, Sports Science and  performance analysis, with player trading having a greater impact on our  overall performance, whilst maintaining the objective of achieving  excellence.  Once again, the biggest challenge facing the Board is the  management of salary and transfer costs whilst achieving playing success  in order to yield satisfactory financial results. Clearly, European  progression remains key in enabling the Club to achieve its financial  objectives.  Peter Lawwell    13 August 2010 Chief Executive<br></div></div>
