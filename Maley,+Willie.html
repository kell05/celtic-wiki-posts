He    led Celtic to 30 major trophies in 43 years as manager.   <br><br>Although     Maley was born in Newry Barracks, where his father was a soldier in    the  British Army, his family moved to Scotland when he was young. As a     young man, Maley was much more involved in athletics than in  football    (SAAU 100 yards champion June 1896), although he had played a  few  games   for Cathcart Hazelbank Juniors in 1886 and had played with  Third  Lanark   A.C. from later that year.<br><br><b>Playing days</b><img align="right" alt="Maley, Willie - The Celtic Wiki" height="344" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/c1af70d7af75b3a7e68afc92fd9a0ad1/GW256H344" title="Maley, Willie - The Celtic Wiki" width="256"><br>In   1888, he  was  signed by the fledgling Celtic and became one of the   club&#39;s first   players as a midfielder. When John Glass and Brother   Walfrid made the   visit to the Maley family home in Cathcart in Dec   1887, famously <a href="/page/Maley%2C+Tom" target="_self">Tom Maley </a>(Willie&#39;s     brother) wasn&rsquo;t home that evening (out impressing a young lady) but    the  Celtic party ensured their trip wasn&rsquo;t wasted by recruiting  Willie    Maley &ndash; a move which of course had massive repercussions on  the    development and success of the club for decades to come. <br><br>Tom  was their    original target, but by chance or fate we landed with the  indomitable    Willie Maley. Possibly it was divine intervention, as the  story is told    that it was on their way out that Brother Walfrid was  to turn to  Willie   Maley and say: &ldquo;<i>Why don&rsquo;t you come with him?</i>&rdquo;  and a true   personal  Celtic connection was formed which endured for  over   half-a-century. Few  other words have had as big an impact as  those   ones.<br><br>As a player  he played his part but was possibly limited in   his abilities, with the  publication &#39;<i>Scottish Referee</i>&#39; describing his   ability as being &quot;<i>Too modest to shine on the field where he always seems to be holding himself in reserve</i>&quot;. Possibly it was his limitations as a player that helped to fuel his drive to succeed greater as a manager.<br><br>His     first taste for top level football was with Third Lanark for whom he     played prior to Celtic. However, it was at Celtic that he made his   name   and was said to have been a stand-out in the Scottish Cup final   of 1892   (Celtic&#39;s first), for which his mother must have been proud to   read of   (as she used to have to walk down the road each Sunday to  get  the  papers  to find out the score). In those early days, it was  about   winning all  competitions as possible and the local trophies  (Glasgow   Cup and others)  were as important, with Willie Maley a main  player in   those early days,  helping to build up the name of the club.  <br><br>Despite   any criticism  of his playing ability, the national  team selectors   deemed him worthy  of a place in the national side. Due  to spending a   considerable amount  of his childhood in Scotland, he  earned the right   to play for the  Scotland team, and won two caps in  1893 against England   and Ireland  (country of his birth). Maley also  represented the   Scottish League in  another match.<br><br>Whilst many  came &amp; went   over those first years  (some to clubs in  England for  good salaries),   Maley remained at Celtic  for most of the  time with  the odd sortie   away. In 1896, he even made a  single appearance for  Manchester City in a   Second Division match  against Loughborough,  where his brother was to   later become the manager  and a leading light  for the club. Celtic   though was were his heart  ultimately was, and  it was there he made his   name as a player and then  to be as the  club&#39;s first manager.<br><br><b>Manager</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Maley, Willie - Pic" height="405" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/qHXcz7bg_591Rx_Vi4-YWg45320/GW241H405" title="Maley, Willie - Pic" width="241"></h3>His    stature  &amp; loyalty did not go unnoticed, and in 1897 the board of    Celtic  directors appointed Willie Maley, at just 29 years of age, as     Secretary-Manager - the first manager - of Celtic, a sign of  progress    and evolution for the developing club. It was to be a great  appointment    from the start, as he took the team on to win the League  Championship    for the club in his first full season as manager. An  incredible    achievement and set the ball rolling for the club and set  the benchmark    for the near and thereafter.<br><br>Despite being the  manager, Maley    never worked with his players in training, he  preferred watching games    from the directors&#39; box and never indulged  much in team talks or spoke    to his players at half-time or  post-match. Maley would not even  announce   the team: players learned  if they were in or out through  reading the   line-up on the noticeboard  or even in the newspaper.  People shouldn&#39;t   get the wrong impression.  Willie Maley worked  tirelessly for the club.   He devoted huge amounts  of time to developing  a network of contacts and   following players.  Contract negotiation was  heavily reliant on the work   of men like  Maley who could easily be  tempted away. <br><br>Celtic had   been a  buying club in their opening  decade, spending heavily to bring    professionals to the club. Maley  decided to scrap that and rely almost    entirely on recruiting  youngsters fresh from junior football. The   effect  of this  (unintentionally or otherwise) was that Maley was then   able to  mould a  team in the way he liked to see football being  played.  He  instilled  therefore &#39;<i>The Celtic Way</i>&#39; in practise on  the field  by  taking  the players from cradle to grave at the club,  fathering them  and   building them both as athletes and as people. In  practice, it was   Willie  Maley who put into play on the field Brother  Walfrid&#39;s ethos. <br><br>The    curious point about Maley is that  despite having been one of the old    Brigade that laid the ethos of the  club and more than any of them put  it   in practise, he himself did  not subscribe to everything that was  the   general viewpoint of the  supporters or his fellow administrators  at   Celtic. Having been born  into a British military family he was very    sympathetic to the Royal  establishment, being very proud on those    opportunities when he met  their members. Having been a supporter of home    rule for Ireland, he  did chide fellow adherents to that cause in  later   years for certain  aspects to their beliefs and their behaviour.  <br><br>Like   Celtic  Chairman John McLaughlin, he was also quite sympathetic to  the  armed  forces.  A contentious opinion in what was a turbulent time,    especially against a  Celtic support who were far from sympathetic   after  the events in  Ireland and the tragedies of the First World War,   but it  is a measure  of the man that he could think of his own views   yet also  respect those  of others who differed from them, else he may   have had  difficulties  working alongside certain people at the club. <br><br>Willie Maley was simply practising as he preached, his mantra was clear: <br><blockquote>&quot;<i>It&#39;s not the creed nor his nationality that counts. It&#39;s the man himself.</i>&quot;<br></blockquote><br>As     a manager, his greatest skill was to build teams from scratch and   then   to rebuild another in time, using his skills to spot young talent   for   the squad rather than be spendthrift. He used to openly take   pride at   his ability to be frugal in his choices for the squad. He   liked to state   how he built his teams with minimal cost, preferring to   breed young   players and bring them through, something that  definitely  the boards   from early on used to their benefit and  possibly got too  overused to.<br><br><b>Maley&#39;s First Golden Team (1900s)<br></b>His   first great side came in the  first decade of  the 1900&#39;s. Maley formed   &amp; reared a young team  who together won  six league titles in a row   between 1905 and 1910,  and won the first  Scottish League and Scottish   Cup doubles in  Scottish footballing  history (a clean-sweep of the two   major titles,  the League Cup wasn&#39;t  around then). It was regarded as the   finest  team in world football,  and the six-in-a-row record remained   unbroken  until the 1970s. The  stars of that side included right-back   Alec  McNair (&quot;the Icicle&quot;);  inside-right Jimmy McMenemy (&quot;Napoleon&quot;);   and  the centre-forward Jimmy  Quinn, all greats. They played wonderful    football and were a major  light in the growing game.<br><br>On a    personal level, one of the most  memorable moments for Maley came in    1904, when he and his brother Tom  guided Celtic &amp; Man City to their    respective glory in the  Scottish Cup &amp; FA Cup, it was  the first    time (and probably the  only time) brothers have had such success at  the   same time in  management. 						 						It wasn&#39;t the only family    footballing  connection, as younger brother Alex Maley was to become  the   manager at  various clubs including Clyde, Clydebank, Hibernian  and   Crystal  Palace.<br><br>Regardless of all the success, Maley never  rested   on  his laurels and was a pragmatist in football, and when  that first    great team grew old, Maley proceeded to build his second  great team,    which included the peerless Patsy Gallacher and the  ageless McMenemy.    The team won four titles in succession between 1914  and 1917 and set    what is still the UK record for an unbeaten run in  professional    football: 62 games (49 won, 13 drawn), from 13 November  1915 until 21    April 1917 (with the peerless Charlie Shaw in goals).  The great feat    came also in light of the First World War. Not an easy  environment, and    Maley was able to hold onto many of his best  charges as was wanted by    authorities to keep up morale at home. <br><br>Celtic  helped to keep   pride up  for the men at home and those with thoughts  of home on the   front line.  Maley was also very sympathetic to the  returning men from   the war, and  those blinded from the warfare were  not shunned but Maley   encouraged the  blinded servicemen to Celtic and  in effect began the   first system in  football to assist the blind, a  great service that   continues to this  day.<br><br><img align="right" alt="Maley, Willie - Pic" height="212" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/pd12A1nm8NhYaljBGwcJOA27853/GW317H212" title="Maley, Willie - Pic" width="317">That    great side won two more titles, in 1919 and 1922,  cementing   themselves  in the annals of Celtic history. The team continued  to win   further  trophies into the 1920s but a decline had begun and it  was   becoming  apparent that it was time to consider a change in the    coaching as much  as the playing staff. <br><br>Maley though was a  bedrock &amp;   an institution  of the club and any many wishing to  tackle Maley (be  it  at board level  or coaching level) was taking on a  lot. The  environment  was getting  increasingly heated with Rangers  stepping up  under Struth  and abusing  whatever influence they could to  steamroller  over all else.  Maley was  ageing but he would not budge.<br><br>Importantly,   Maley&#39;s  career  shouldn&#39;t be seen as just a list of great honours won   by the  teams he  played for or built. If anything, his greatest  success  was to  be able  to rear good young players and then mould the  sides  into  successful  units that played great football. With talents  like  McInally,  McGrory  and Patsy Gallacher, Maley ensured the fans  could  come to  Celtic and be  entertained by the performance as much  the  results. He  also stuck by  those others wished to cut short fast.  For  example, Jimmy  Quinn is a  legend for the club, yet he was one  with  critics with the  board wishing  to ditch him after a inauspicious   start, but Maley saw  more in him  declaring: &quot;<i>I believed there was in this young collier chap the stuff of which great players are made.</i>&quot;  <br><br>It    showed Maley&#39;s ability to see beyond the short-term, and he coaxed    the  best out of what was an initially shy Jimmy Quinn. Quinn had even    been  coaxed by Willie Maley who used not only his own stature but also    his  skills as physio in helping Quinn out prior to signing for the   club  to  help entice him into the Celtic fold. Quinn never thought he&#39;d   make  it  as a pro but Maley thought otherwise and in time got him to   sign for   the club. It was a measure of the lengths that Maley would  go  as a   person for the club (and for others), and Jimmy Quinn was to  be  in debt   personally to Maley and the support. <br><br>Dealing with a   wide  variety  of characters showed that Maley was a great surrogate   father to  the  squad. Tommy McInally is divisive to historians in his    contribution  &amp; net worth to Celtic, but there is no denying his    talent to  entertain and bring out a surprise on the pitch. It wouldn&#39;t    have been  possible though with out Willie Maley, who spent a great   deal  of time,  effort and patience on the often McInally. He was Tommy    McInally&#39;s boss  on the one hand but a father figure on the other to    him, and he played  both roles to a level beyond what anyone could have    asked of. It spoke  volumes of Maley&#39;s character. It showed that he   took  his position as  being more than just a task. Others such as   McMenemy,  Willie Buchan,  Adam McLean, Peter Wilson, Patsy Gallacher   and so many  others owed so  much to him. To illustrate Maley&#39;s spirit   on developing  players, he once  wrote &quot;<i>apples will grow again</i>&quot;, a romantically apt quote illustrating his philosophy on rearing players.<br><br>There     was a cost to this relationship too. The premature deaths of John     Thomson on the field followed by that of Peter Scarff from the same     squad is hard for anyone, but Maley was their father at Celtic. He was     hurt badly as were all from the John Thompson&#39;s death, but Maley is   said   to have taken the death of the latter particularly badly. We can   only   imagine the pain the losses of these two Celts in their prime   would  have  done to Maley. He&#39;d brought them to Celtic and reared them,   only  to see  them die young whilst still under his tutelage. No   manager you  would  hope should ever be put in this predicament but   Maley was sadly  to face  it twice in a short spell. <br><br>However,   Maley came from an   old-school conservative upbringing, and his manner   leaned heavily on  the  heavily formal side. He cared for his players   but he had a style  that  was overly formal if not dictatorial (likely   stemming from his  family&#39;s  Victorian age military background). He   could be swift to act  if there  was any confrontation, especially if   money was involved and  sadly this  did lose the club some good players   over the years. <br><br>Celtic  favourite  Malcolm McDonald is said to  stay on  the trams one stop  further in order  to avoid Maley as he  didn&#39;t  believe they would have a convivial chat,  possibly a touch  unfair but  Maley did point out to him  unequivocally  that: &quot;<i>Now remember Malcolm, if you don&#39;t do as I tell you, you won&#39;t be here.</i>&quot;     People used to get out the way when he came down from his office,  but    this was as much out of respect as anything else. With Maley&#39;s   physical   stature alone could have frightened any young player. <br><br><b>1930&#39;s onwards</b><br>Into     the mid-1930s Maley built his third great team, featuring Jimmy     Delaney  and Jimmy McGrory. This side won the league title in 1936 and     1938 and  the cup in 1937. By then, Maley was approaching 70 .  However,   this was  late on in his managerial career and he was letting  things   slip badly.  In those days, the manager had to do everything  and with   the game  changing rapidly in importance and interest, it was  all a   shock to the  system with coaches like Maley learning on their  feet, but   there&#39;s just  so much that any man can take. Maley in  retrospect  wasn&#39;t  realising it  or admitting it. Celtic was his life  as he used to  say  publicly, so  possibly losing Celtic was a fear for  him.<br><br>Those   who point to the  trophies won in the late 1930&#39;s  need to note that   Maley was not really  the acting manager in that  briefly successful   period. Jimmy McMenemy was  brought in as the  assistant manager and in   practise became the de facto  first team  manager. A sharp contrast to   the straight-laced Maley,  McMenemy was  relaxed and approachable. Maley   was said to have been  unhappy with  some of the tactical progress put   into play by McMenemy but  came  around to it after the success it   brought (a sign that Maley was   stuck in the past). <br><br>However,   after Joe Dodds was brought in to  assist  McMenemy, it was a sure sign   to Maley that it was time to  hang up his coat and badge. The    half-centenary season of 1937-38  should have been the best time to step    down for Maley but he  stubbornly carried on. For a period he seemed to    be more caught up  writing his book on Celtic than on managing the  first   team.<br><br>The  Maley years was to end in a less than happy  fashion.   With Celtic at  the bottom of the table, and after a meeting  with the   board of  directors in February 1940, Maley &#39;retired&#39;. Not an  easy task   for the  board as likely many of them looked up to him as  much as the    support, he was a pivotal player in the rise of the club.<br><br>Sadly,     there was a very bitter parting of the ways over the tax on a 2500      guineas honorarium. It was meant as a golden  handshake but Maley  never    took the hint and the board hardened their  stance by refusing  to pay    the tax on it. Could have likely been better managed by the  board but    Willie Maley could be quite cantankerous himself and this  all turned    unintentionally sour. <br><br><b>Post-Celtic</b><br><h3><img align="right" alt="Willie Maley Kicks off his testimonial" height="438" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/1/BRc6S7QZvVsmW7wYRfJWGw358712/GW273H438" title="Willie Maley Kicks off his testimonial" width="273"></h3>Maley    did not  set  foot back again into Celtic Park again for 13 years,    extraordinary for a  man who had lived  and breathed Celtic for the    previous fifty-two  years. Rangers took advantage of the discord and    actually invited Maley  to be a guest at a Rangers v Celtic game at    Ibrox. He accepted the  invitation but he was supporting Celtic as much    as he ever did.<br><br>Willie  Maley did  make up with the board in   1953  after the death of ex-Celt  Patsy Gallagher when  chairman Bob   Kelly  got in touch and a Willie Maley  Testimonial Fund match was    played  between Celtic and a Bohemians  select at Celtic Park in aid of   the   Grampian sanatorium in Kingussie. <br><br>Now aged 85, he was enthusiastically  greeted back. He was home.<br><br>He     was to be a frequent visitor to Celtic Park thereafter until  his    death  on 2nd April 1958 in a nursing home at 32 Mansion House Road,     Glasgow  at 8.30am aged 89. He died of arteriosclerosis and senility.<br><br>Maley     was the longest serving manager at Celtic, the longest reign of any     manager at any senior club in the UK. In total, in his 43 years as     manager, he had won 16 league titles, 14 Scottish Cups, 14 Glasgow Cups     and 19 Glasgow Charity Cups. It wasn&#39;t the mass of trophies that was     most important about Maley, it was his character &amp; ethos. He     engendered the moral framework around the club and how we were to work.     There is no denying that the club has at times swayed but that has   been to  our cost  and we have always returned. <br><br>Celtic have  always  been a  club that emphasises  our support and culture, and  Willie Maley  has  played a huge part in  this. Any man who questions  his importance,  just  needs to look to the  Huns and the odious ethos  that has  underpinned  their club since Struth  imposed his disreputable  values.  Maley embedded  the need to respect a  man and give him an  opportunity  to build his  character; Struth imposed  bigotry and  arrogance into  Rangers to create  their hegemony.<br><br>Willie Maley&#39;s name is still proudly chanted in every Celtic gathering; his name titles one of the club&#39;s most sung songs, <a href="/page/Willie+Maley+-+Song" target="_self">&#39;Willie Maley&#39; by David Cameron</a>, and it is one of the most popular Celtic songs amongst the support.<br><br>His     persona, his character and his ethos still underpins to this day  what Celtic Football Club stands for, and the support will forever be in  his debt to what he      brought to the club. <br><br>We will always remember him. </div><div><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"

Men of the     type of McNair, Hay, Lyon, Buchan, Cringan, the Thomspons, or Paterson     soon found out that broadmindedness which is the real stamp of the  good    Christian existed to its fullest at Celtic Park, where a man was   judged   by his football alone.&quot;<br><b>Willie Maley from &quot;The Story of The Celtic&quot; (1939)<br><br></b>&ldquo;Willie     Maley was a great man but a person I used to regard with awe.

A will dating from before his   illness   left his  estate to a group of trustees. His son Charles and   cousin,   Agnes  Montgomery of Dublin, presented a Christmas card that   had been   written  by Willie whilst in the nursing home, dated 28th   December,   1957. At a  Court of Sessions hearing in Edinburgh on <a class="external" href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2mus-XyGPC0C&dat=19590224&printsec=frontpage&hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">24th February 1959</a>,      the judge, Lord Walker, agreed with Charles and the Christmas card,      leaving all his estate to his son Charles, was accepted as a valid    will.   The trustees vouched that since entering the nursing home in    October   1957 his mental state was such that  he was not aware of what    he was   doing. His son maintained that up to a  few days before his    death he was   in full control of his mental faculties  and the will  on   the Christmas   card was therefore valid. The judge and  court  agreed. <br><br>2)   In  some games during his playing career Maley was  listed on the    team-sheet  as &#39;Montgomery&#39;. This alias - his mother&#39;s  maiden name - was    probably  adopted to avoid his employers, an  accountancy firm, from    finding out  he was continuing to play as a  professional footballer!
