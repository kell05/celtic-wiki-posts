Man City stun Barca with 3-1 win. Barca still on top though on 9pts, Man City on 7pts. <br></li><li>Most Celtic fans had already written off European football post December after the defeat to Borussia M in the last match. Now in with a chance (albeit still slim).</li><li>1st Nov is actually a bank holiday in Germany (All Saints Day)! So travelling fans find much of the towns quiet and most shops closed.<br></li><li>Celtic close to winning this but unlucky not too and could have stolen it close to the death. A great atmosphere and good mixing between the fans.<br></li><li>It&#39;s Poppy season again, with the usual poppy fascist brigade out in force. N Ireland player James McLean again targetted for not wanting to wear a poppy. It&#39;s his right to choose to do so or not. Again Celtic being targetted by some, and Sevco pandering to the hordes. Scotland and England banned from wearing poppy at Wembley game by UEFA. <br></li><li>Griffiths, Simunovic and Toure not travelling with Celtic to Germany through illness and injury. Bad news. <br></li><li> Celtic team&rsquo;s shirts carried the logo of Celtic FC Foundation due to restrictions on betting promotion in Germany.</li><li>Rumours overdrive with papers claiming that Man U, Real Madrid, Man City etc after &pound;40m rated Dembele. Until otherwise take with a pinch of salt. <br></li><li>Twitter: &quot;The &pound;25m-rated Dembele so powerful before a clear pull on the &pound;35m Frenchman.   A definite penalty, calmly finished by the &pound;55m striker.&quot;</li><li>Celtic supposedly looking at building a hotel around Celtic Park. Not uncommon for some stadiums to have this option around their ground. <br></li><li>Dembele, 13 year old Celtic Boys Club member, plays for Scotland U16s. Fast progress, but should be careful.</li><li>Borussia fans have sense of humour and satirise the humourous spelling joke about Borussia M which was displayed outside a pub in Edinburgh at the last game (the photo went viral)</li></ul><br><img align="bottom" alt="2016-11-01: Borussia Monchengladbach 1-1 Celtic, European Cup - The Celtic Wiki" height="173" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/0704c619d8bf33453a920f07dfbedc4a/GW500H173" title="2016-11-01: Borussia Monchengladbach 1-1 Celtic, European Cup - The Celtic Wiki" width="500"><br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3><font color="#333333">  Review<img align="right" alt="A German Team V Celtic" height="227" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/95457dc62b4b65e870384c8a3eaa1005/GW415H227" title="A German Team V Celtic" width="415"></font></h3>(CelticWiki Twitter)<br>Delighted with the point. Delighted with the performance. Delighted with the progress. Delighted with the potential to improve further.<br><br>(Henry C of KDS)<br><br>That was as good a European result as we&#39;ve had for years and years. Any  club that gets a Champions League draw in Germany has done very well  indeed and tonight was no exception.<br>Armstrong has room for improvement but he should keep his place for just now because he puts in a far better shift than Bitton.<br>Some  of the vitriol being directed at MacGregor on here tonight is shameful.  He had a glimmer of a chance from a tight angle against a keeper who  got his position perfect. He had a split second to make a decision and  execute it perfectly but he didn&#39;t manage to squeeze it into the tiny  gap between the goalie and the back stick. Too bad. I&#39;ve seen world  class strikers, including Henrik, miss comparable chances so a bit of  perspective is in order.  However, it would have been even harder to  thread the perfect pass through to Sinclair than to score from that  position so that criticism is a non-starter.<br>Overall, I&#39;m well  pleased with the result and the performance. No idea which version of  our CL Jekyll and Hyde displays we&#39;ll see in the next two games but I  wouldn&#39;t rule out post-Christmas European competitions just yet. We  might still collect some more points if we continue to show this kind of  progress.<br><br>(KDS Poster)<br>Although disappointed not to win, especially when they went down to 10  men, 1-1 is probably a fair reflection of how even the game was. To  think of where we have come from over the past 2 years with poor  performances vs Malmo et al and add our away record, that was a very  good result.<br><br>What was telling though was our lack of composure at  times on the ball in their half. We were wasteful in possession,  hurrying passes that didn&#39;t need to be hurried. But that is  understandable as we don&#39;t play against that standard of opposition  every week and players are not used to having less time on the ball.  More experience at this level is what the team needs. If we can get that  composure, then even without additions to the squad, we will do better  in the future.<br><br>Defensively I was pleased, particularly as this  was a new back line again. We did have a few hairy moments due to  players switching off but overall an improvement, Better cover from  midfield would have helped immensely (Brown was great, he had no  support).<br><br>Rogic had a quiet game, which meant we struggled to get  out and we looked a lot better when Rogic went off. Roberts offered  more than Forrest but by that time, we were starting to play more in  their half, freeing him up from defensive duties.

As one of the building blocks Rodgers is seeking to lay as the foundations for regular participation in the latter stages of Europe&rsquo;s elite tournament, it was a<br><br>solid start.<br><br>Dembele&rsquo;s 16th goal of the season came after he was hauled down by Borussia defender Julian Korb, who received a straight red card for his troubles. Celtic, who were fortunate only to be trailing 1-0 to Lars Stindl&rsquo;s first-half strike at that stage, had salvaged their hopes of further progress in Europe this season.<br><br>They will require what will still be widely regarded as an unlikely sequence of results from their final two games at home to Barcelona and away to Manchester City, but this was a resilient display from which Rodgers can take<br>Lars Stindl picks up the balll after scoring his side&#39;s opener.

Picture: Getty<br><br>satisfaction.<br><br>The early signs were not especially encouraging for Celtic as Borussia appeared capable of simply taking up where they had left off in Glasgow two weeks ago in terms of their superiority in possession. The initial exchanges certainly presented a significant test for Celtic&rsquo;s makeshift back four in which Cristian Gamboa, drafted in at right-back with Mikael Lustig required in central defence to replace the unfit Jozo Simunovic, looking vulnerable and uncomfortable.<br><br>The closest Borussia came to making their early pressure count was when Jannik Vestergaard saw his header deflected wide after latching onto Thorgan Hazard&rsquo;s corner kick, one of several forced by the hosts as Celtic found themselves firmly on the back foot.<br><br>Hazard, the younger brother of Chelsea and Belgium star Eden, was making his return from a month-long injury lay-off and it was quickly apparent he shares many of the technical gifts bestowed upon his more renowned sibling.<br><br>He was involved in most of Borussia&rsquo;s most eye-catching moments in the opening period, including a brilliantly disguised pass which carved out a clear sight of goal for Tobias Strobl at the end of a sweeping move. Craig Gordon came to Celtic&rsquo;s rescue on that occasion, making an excellent blocking save.<br><br>Celtic gradually managed to draw much of the sting out of Borussia&rsquo;s attacking efforts and started to enjoy some decent spells of controlled possession of their own. It would have been stretching a point to suggest they were taking the initiative but they did come agonisingly close to taking the lead in the 24th minute.<br><br>Gamboa, for all of his defensive uncertainty, lacked nothing in his willingness to try to get forward whenever possible. The Costa Rican surged down the right before delivering a scuffed cross which found its way beyond a flat-footed Borussia back four into the path of Scott Sinclair.<br><br>The winger curled a delightful right-foot shot from the edge of the penalty area which had the beating of Yann Sommer all ends up. The Borussia goalkeeper could only look in with relief as the ball struck the inside of his left-hand post and rebounded to safety.<br><br>Suddenly, it was a far more evenly contested affair in which Celtic carried a far greater air of purpose and confidence in their work. But just as it seemed it was Borussia who now had more problems to solve, they claimed the opening goal.<br><br>Hazard found space on the right-hand side of Celtic&rsquo;s penalty area and eluded Emilio Izaguirre&rsquo;s attention with almost contemptuous ease. His cross picked out Stindl who steered a first-time, right-foot shot beyond Gordon from around 12 yards.<br><br>It was a dispiriting moment for the visitors who found themselves facing an all-too- familiar scenario on their European travels. Their most threatening attempt at finding a positive response before the interval came when Stuart Armstrong, preferred to Nir Bitton as he made his first Champions League starting appearance, shot over from distance.<br><br>Borussia increased the tempo of their play at the start of the second half. Stindl had a premium opportunity to score again when he was played in by Andre Hahn&rsquo;s clever pass but his failure to connect cleanly with the shot allowed Gordon to make a simple save. Fabian Johnson then saw a shot deflected narrowly wide of Gordon&rsquo;s left-hand post.<br><br>Celtic were hanging on grimly at this stage and only the frame of Gordon&rsquo;s goal kept them in contention when a shot by Hahn smacked back off the left-hand upright. Having ridden their luck, Celtic began to threaten on the counter-attack and Dembele forced Sommer into his first telling save of the night after good work by Sinclair. Celtic&rsquo;s top scorer had seen little of the ball but he became the central figure when Rodgers&rsquo; men drew level with 14 minutes left.<br><br>A brilliant backheel pass by Scott Brown allowed substitute Patrick Roberts to find Dembele on the left of the penalty area. Despite being clearly fouled by Korb, Dembele managed to get away his shot which went just wide. Portuguese referee Manuel De Sousa pulled the play back, awarding Celtic the spot-kick and dismissing Korb. Dembele, who failed to convert a penalty in Celtic&rsquo;s previous away game in the group against Barcelona, made no mistake this time as he coolly sent Sommer the wrong way. Both sides had chances to grab a winner, Callum McGregor wasting the best of them for Celtic with three minutes remaining when he shanked a shot wide from close range. But it was a point well made for Rodgers and his players nonetheless.<br><br><br>Brendan Rodgers: &lsquo;Celtic were the better team&rsquo;<br>http://www.scotsman.com/sport/football/teams/celtic/brendan-rodgers-celtic-were-the-better-team-1-4274918<br><br>Brendan Rodgers believes Celtic deserved to take all three points from the 1-1 draw against Borussia Monchengladbach in Germany which has extended their hopes of further progress in Europe this season.<br><br>The Scottish champions remain in contention for a last-16 place in the Champions League after Moussa Dembele&rsquo;s 76th-minute penalty cancelled out Lars Stindl&rsquo;s first-half opener for the Bundesliga side.<br>Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers.

Picture: Alex Grimm/Bongarts/Getty Images<br><br>Borussia were reduced to 10 men for the closing stages with defender Julian Korb sent off for the foul on Dembele which led to the spot-kick and Celtic substitute Callum McGregor missed a gilt-edged chance to win the game for the Scottish champions with three minutes remaining.<br><br>&ldquo;I thought we were the better team,&rdquo; said Celtic manager Rodgers. &ldquo;We should have scored again. Callum&rsquo;s either got to score or he&rsquo;s got to square it to finish.<br><br>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m really proud of the players tonight because I said to them that in order for us to improve at this level, we needed to play with personality. And the personality we showed in the game was outstanding.<br><br>&ldquo;We were very brave on the ball and opened up the pitch to play. We built the game, secured the game and created chances with real speed on  the counter attack. We had chances to win.<br><br>&ldquo;We hit the post and could have scored at the end. So it was an outstanding team performance and the beginning for us, really, at this level in terms of the personality we need to play with.<br><br>&ldquo;What was important for us was to get some sort of result. But I said to the players beforehand that win lose or draw I wanted us to play the way we know we can.<br><br>&ldquo;I wanted to show we can come away to a really tough place in Europe and perform. So for me they deserve a huge amount of credit.&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic remain bottom of Group C with just two points from their first four games but could still reach the last 16.<br><br>They would need to win both of their remaining fixtures, at home to Barcelona on 23 November and then away to Manchester City on 6 December, while also requiring Borussia to fail to beat City in Germany and then lose away to Barcelona.<br><br>A more realistic target for Celtic is securing third place in the group which would provide the consolation prize of a place in the last 32 of the Europa League.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a result that keeps us  in there fighting,&rdquo; added  Rodgers. &ldquo;We always knew this was going to be a difficult group but that performance makes me very proud. It&rsquo;s another step forward for this team, a result which gives them that belief that they can perform well.&rdquo;<br><br>Rodgers praised Dembele who scored his 16th goal of the season for Celtic. The 20-year-old French striker failed from the spot when Celtic trailed 1-0 to Barcelona in the Nou Camp in their opening Group C match this season, which they eventually lost 7-0, but made no mistake last night.<br><br>&ldquo;It was a big moment for Moussa,&rdquo; said Rodgers. &ldquo;He showed great composure to tuck it away against a top class keeper. His presence and quality really disturbed their back four in the game.&rdquo;  <b><br><br><br>The Herald</b><br><br>GORDON (6): No chance with the opening goal after been left  chronically exposed by his napping defenders. One poor kick out just  after the interval but a couple of decent stops in the second period.<br><br>IZAGUIRRE  (5:) Torrid time trying to contain the pace of Hazard. Could and should  have done better to block the cross that led to Lars Stindl&rsquo;s opening  goal.Booked just after Dembele&#39;s penalty for a tussle with Herrmann.<br><br>SVIATCHENKO  (6): Will feel that he could have done much better at Stindl&rsquo;s opening  goal after losing the runner. Kept on his toes throughout the night as  Borussia created the best of the chances in the game.<br><br>LUSTIG (6):  Drafted in at centre-half after injuries to Kolo Toure and Jozo  Simunovic. Not at his most comfortable and a few sloppy moments as he  conceded possession.<br><br>GAMBOA (6): The right-back has struggled to  make an impact since his arrival at the club but had a decent enough  evening. Tried to get forward when possible and linked up with Forrest.<br><br>SINCLAIR  (7): The winger&rsquo;s direct running and pace have been pivotal to Celtic  domestically and almost snatched an opener for the Parkhead side with a  clever chip that came off the inside of the post. Did a fair shift in  getting back too.<br><br>ARMSTRONG (6): Started his first Champions  League game but looked out of his depth at times. Gave Celtic an option  going forward but gave the ball away frequently and cheaply in the  middle of the park.<br><br>BROWN (6): Lost possession in the second  period, an error that almost led to Borussia&rsquo;s second goal. His usual  endeavour and energy and grew in influence as the game wore on.<br><br>ROGIC  (6): Unlucky in the opening period to find himself bearing towards goal  only for the move to be halted because of a soft foul from Dembele.  Another who could have done a little more defensively.<br><br>FORREST  (6): Tried to make an impression with his pace but genuine incursions  were few and far between. Was replaced with Patrick Roberts on the hour  mark.<br><br>DEMBELE (6): Should have went for goal as the game headed  towards the break instead of pushing the ball out to James Forrest.  Decision making could have been better but massive courage to win and  then convert penalty.<br><br>ROBERTS (5): On for Forrest and tried to  inject a bit if pace and creativity into proceedings. Provided the pass  which led to Celtic&#39;s penalty.<br><br>MCGREGOR (5): On in the latter  stages of the game and will be haunted by the chance he had to win it.  Found himself one-on-one through on goal but contrived to send his shot  wide of the target.<br><br>Henderson (4): On for the final five minutes.  Had one shot that he steered wide of the target as Celtic finished the  game strongly.<br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  BBC<br>http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/37825915<br><br><br>By Alasdair Lamont<br><br>BBC Scotland at Borussia-Park<br><br> From the section Football <br><br>Moussa Dembele scores a penalty<br>Moussa Dembele scored his third Group C goal to draw Celtic level in Germany<br><br>Celtic kept their Champions League hopes alive by battling back to draw with Borussia Monchengladbach.<br><br>Scott Sinclair curled a shot against the post for the visitors before Lars Stindl volleyed Gladbach ahead.<br><br>Andre Hahn fired off the crossbar as the hosts pressed for a second and Celtic&#39;s Moussa Dembele drew a save from goalkeeper Yann Sommer.<br><br>Dembele was then fouled by Julian Korb, who was sent off, and the striker converted the resulting penalty.<br><br>Brendan Rodgers&#39; side, who face Barcelona in Glasgow on 23 November, move on to two points at the bottom of Group C, trailing Gladbach by two points and final group opponents Manchester City by five.<br><br> Celtic should have won - Rodgers<br> Celtic player ratings<br><br>Champions League Group C<br>Deadly Dembele<br><br>Though Celtic&#39;s Champions League fate is all but sealed, Dembele&#39;s cool penalty ensures they can still overtake Borussia in third and secure a Europa League berth.<br><br>Having missed a spot-kick in Camp Nou at a crucial stage of the group opening 7-0 defeat by Barca, the French striker showed great confidence to step up in another intimidating atmosphere and earn his side a potentially crucial point.<br><br>It was his 16th goal of the season and third in the Champions League group stage.<br><br>He has been an outstanding acquisition by Rodgers and at the age of 20 already looks an accomplished performer at the highest level.<br><br>His evening could have been even better had Sommer not kept out an earlier effort on a night when Celtic could conceivably have nicked a victory.<br>Scott Sinclair and Moussa Dembele<br>Celtic&#39;s attackers finished strongly at Borussia-Park<br>Missed opportunities<br><br>With the scoreline goalless, Sinclair&#39;s curling shot came within inches of ending up in the back of the net, ricocheting away off the inside of the post.<br><br>And in the dying moments, greater composure from Callum McGregor should have led to the substitute scoring or creating a late winner rather than drag his shot wide.<br><br>That is one lesson Celtic have to learn if they are to become a &quot;last-16 side&quot; as Rodgers desires.<br><br>Too often Celtic got in to promising positions, only for the move to break down because of a poor choice or inaccurate pass.<br>Scott Sinclair shoots<br>Sinclair (right) gave the home fans an anxious moment in the first half<br>Lethal lapse<br><br>As Rodgers had noted pre-match, the Champions League is an unforgiving environment and a lack of precision in a pass or a momentary lull in concentration is likely to be punished.<br><br>So it was as Borussia constructed a fine passing move, begun by Jannik Vestergaard&#39;s raking diagonal pass to Korb, linked by Christoph Kramer to Thorgan Hazard, and emphatically finished by Stindl.<br>Lars Stindl scores<br>Stindl (second from left) opened the scoring, as he did in last month&#39;s 2-0 win at Celtic Park<br><br>But the space afforded to Korb and more damagingly Stindl underlines what Celtic still have to improve upon.<br><br>Further carelessness as they tried to play their way out of defence could have seen them fall two goals behind, but Andre Hahn&#39;s guided shot came clattering back off the frame of the goal.<br><br>But there was much to be pleased about for Celtic, their manager and supporters who can go into the final matches in the knowledge they still have much to play for, having avoided defeat in an away Champions League group match for only the third time in 26 trips.<br><br><br>Match ends, Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach 1, Celtic 1.<br>Full Time<br>90&#39;+4&#39;<br><br>Second Half ends, Borussia M&ouml;nchengladbach 1, Celtic 1.<br>90&#39;+1&#39;<br><br>Attempt blocked.
