This book documents the campaign to save the club from the receivers and wrestle control from the board. <br><br>David Low and Francis Shennan were both involved in the takeover, as the financial expert who witnessed the last document being signed and the business journalist who broke the story of the takeover plan respectively.<br><i><br>(from later reprint in 2009)</i><br>The McCann Years: The Inside Story of Celtic&#39;s Revolution<br>GOOD FRIDAY  fell on April 1 in 1994, but to supporters of the &quot;grand old team&quot; it  had already fallen on March 4. That was the name they gave to the Friday  when the deal once thought impossible was done. The so-called rebels  walked into the football ground the fans knew as &#39;Paradise&#39; to end a  106-year dynasty and take control of Celtic Football Club.<br><br>It  marked the end of a carefully planned campaign which became one of the  most public stories of the 1990s, or so it appeared. Every possible  angle of the story seemed to be covered in the papers, and on radio and  television, not just in Scotland but throughout Britain, in Ireland and  in Canada. But it wasn&#39;t, and beneath the avalanche of headlines the  real story remained hidden.<br><br>The sheer scale of the media  coverage actually helped to obscure the truth. When on 19 January 1992  the story first broke that a group of businessmen were putting together  an attempt to take control of Celtic, vast numbers of people said it  could never happen. The story was denied the same day in another Sunday  newspaper. One of the two journalists who broke the story was Francis  Shennan. The man denying the story was David Low.<br><br>It was a sign  of how sensitive the situation was that he felt obliged to do it and it  remained sensitive in varying degrees for the next two years. The media  could only report the story as it unfolded, and distractions and  diversions were constantly appearing. Names appeared which had no part  in the story or had only a walk-on part. Public pronouncements were made  while deals were done behind closed doors.<br><br>One man was at every  crucial meeting in the battle to rescue Celtic Football Club. David Low  conceived the takeover plan, briefed first Brian Dempsey, then Fergus  McCann, and all of the many people who were essential to making the plan  work, from the millionaire investors to modest but loyal shareholders.<br><br>He  travelled Britain, Ireland and North America, signing up shareholders&#39;  support or buying up their shares. If there was a deal to be done, he  would go there, whether to an international hotel or a cow shed. When  the rebels fell out, he acted as go-between so they could unite again.  When the two halves of the rebel coalition competed to complete a  takeover deal, he pushed through the one which was successful. His  signature is on the document that rescued the club from receivership  with eight minutes to spare.<br><br>This is the inside story of the  battle for Celtic Football Club, based on exclusive access to  transcripts and diaries. It is not the historical overview, nor is it a  business book. From the start we decided against having a dozen voices  giving their accounts, re-interpreting their behaviour with the benefit  of hindsight. We wanted to convey the excitement, the tensions, the  pressure of the story as it unfolded. It is written in the third person,  like a thriller, and events moved at that kind of pace.<br><br>Because  we take you so close to the story, we concentrate on the central events  of the last four years. There is enough to take in without re-hashing  material already well covered in the papers. Similarly we mention, but  do not go into the details of, earlier attempts at change.<br><br>In  1988, Fergus McCann tried to help Celtic Football Club to expand, to  move into the modern era and give them a stadium to match, so that they  could become a viable business. Long before the Taylor Report and  Celtic&#39;s financial crisis he proposed increasing the seating capacity  from 9,000 to 24,000, providing standing accommodation for 48,000 and  offered a low-cost interest loan and marketing help to bring it about.  This was the first of a number of ideas. He was ready to make an offer  to all the shareholders but the board made it clear they would oppose  it. The man whose money and determination saved Celtic from receivership  was treated as a threat. Yet as he told shareholders in November 1993:<br><br>We  are not enemies of Celtic. We are entitled to be as big supporters of  Celtic as anyone. The fact that w
