Had one save to make in the game and stood-up well. If he  does go in the summer, he&#39;ll have left an official legend and with a lot  of great memories. He&#39;ll be hard to replace.<br><br>Johansen had the  best debut I can remember. Constantly moving, constantly looking around  for a pass or space to run into. I hope he&#39;s consistent and I look  forward to seeing him again next weekend.<br><br>The back 4 were ok up  until Efe started fannying around in the last 20, then they went a bit  all over the place. I can remember one time in the game where VvD didn&#39;t  win a header for a ball he went for, the exception being the one he let  over his head and bounce. I still felt confident he was in control of  it. Izzy had no help off Mulgrew for quite a lot of the game - I&#39;m  actually surprised to see Charlie in some folks&#39; top 3. imo he is  offering very little atm, and could we play Brown, Biton and Johansen in  the same midfield I would be happy to leave Charlie on the bench.<br><br>Commons  wasn&#39;t great but made the best contribution so I&#39;m happy with that.  Forrest did a lot of running without doing much damage including to  himself. The wee man&#39;s a bottler.<br><br>Stokes, for all he tried,  couldn&#39;t buy a goal at the moment. He said on his twitter that he didn&#39;t  know Derk was there for that chance at the end, but I don&#39;t know how  much I believe that. He is a selfish player - as many strikers are - and  he&#39;s not really contributing anything to the cause. I&#39;d start Pukki  against Aberdeen but I don&#39;t think Lenny will. He needs to get a grip  and soon because if Griffiths hits the ground running, Stokes will have a  lot of catching up to do.<br><br>Balde and Boerrigter - Didn&#39;t make  much of an impact, though Boerrigter might have if Stokes had lifted his  head and/or not been a greedy bastard.<br><br>Overall, nowhere near as  good as we could be but still got what we wanted out of the game, that&#39;s  why we&#39;re champions. I just hope we&#39;re better next week coz if we play  like that against Aberdeen next week we could be in bother.<br>  <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table>  <h3>  Teams</h3><div>   <div class="home-team"> <h3 class="team-name">Celtic</h3>  <ul class="player-list"><li>    01  Forster         </li><li>    41  Fisher         </li><li>    03  Izaguirre         </li><li>    25  Johansen         </li><li>    04  Ambrose Emuobo         </li><li>    05  van Dijk         </li><li>    08  Brown         </li><li>    21  Mulgrew         </li><li>    10  Stokes         </li><li>    49  Forrest      (Boerrigter -

In taking the ball around the goalkeeper however he was forced wide and his clipped cross was scrambled clear by Marc McAusland.<br><br>The Celtic supporters showed their solidarity with manager Neil Lennon following the abuse his agent Martin Reilly alleged he received at Tynecastle during the League Cup semi-final between Aberdeen and St Johnstone by giving him a standing ovation in the 18th minute.<br><br>Scott Brown then had a golden opportunity to score when Charlie Mulgrew turned Jason Naismith on the left and pulled the ball back to the penalty spot.<br><br>Commons stepped over the ball to leave Brown with a clear sight of goal, but the Celtic captain could only side-foot well over the crossbar.<br><br>St Mirren drew their first save from Forster after half an hour, with McGinn&rsquo;s long pass finding Greg Wylde scampering down the left flank. With just Fisher in his way, Wylde opted to shoot early and his tame effort was comfortably held by history man Forster.<br><br>Celtic new boy Stefan Johansen was looking tidy in possession, and he showed good feet to side-step Jim Goodwin in midfield before poking just wide from the edge of the box.<br><br>Stokes then fed James Forrest who cut inside on to his left-foot and unleashed a shot that Kello did well to save low to his left, before the home side went even closer to getting their second goal just before half-time.<br><br>A nice exchange between Stokes and Mulgrew allowed the former a chance to open his body up on the edge of the area and curl the ball inches past the post.<br><br>There were nerves around Celtic Park in the 57th minute as Steven Thompson nudged the ball around Forster after latching on to a long pass, however with Efe Ambrose in close attendance and a narrowing angle, the St Mirren frontman could not get a meaningful shot away.<br><br>St Mirren went even closer to an equaliser soon after. Darren McGregor dispossessed Izaguirre deep inside the visitors&rsquo; half and fed Conor Newton, whose early ball up the flank caught the Celtic rear-guard napping.<br><br>Magennis poked the ball around Ambrose and had a clear sight of Forster&rsquo;s goal, the England international doing well to parry away his effort.<br><br>Forrest then passed up a great opportunity at the other end to ease any home nerves, firing wide from six yards after great set-up play by Mulgrew and Stokes.<br><br>Balde next come close to adding to the score within the final 10 minutes, running at the heart of the visitors&rsquo; defence before firing just wide.<br><br>Ambrose gave the ball away carelessly in the final minute to allow Campbell a chance to run into the Celtic area, but the Nigerian got back to clear for a corner.<br><br>The delivery was cleared to Sean Kelly on the half-way line, and Stokes did well to dispossess the young defender to give himself a clear run on goal.<br><br>Incredibly though the striker elected to try to round Kello instead of square the ball to Mulgrew, who would have had an open goal, and he was forced wide.<br><br>Celtic survived a nervous last few moments for Forster to take his place in the club&rsquo;s history books.<br><br>Teams, bookings, subs<br><br>Celtic: Forster, Fisher, Izaguirre, Johansen, Ambrose, van Dijk, Brown, Milgrew, Stokes, Forrest (Boerrigter, 70), Commons (Balde, 79).<br><br>Subs not used: Zaluska, Biton, Samaras, Pukki, O&rsquo;Connell.<br><br>Goals: K Commons 6.<br><br>St Mirren: Kello, Naismith, Kelly, Goodwin (Campbell, 83), McAusland, McGregor, Newton, McGinn, Thompson (McLean, 70), Magennis, Wylde.<br><br>Subs not used: Dilo, van Zanten, Reilly, Brady, Morgan.<br><br>Referee: A Muir<br><br>Attendance: 45,014  <br>  <br><h3>Neil Lennon: Fans abuse was drunken, not sectarian</h3>Neil Lennon accused Aberdeen fans of throwing missiles at him but denied there had been a sectarian element.

Picture: SNS<br><br> by ALASTAIR DALTON and STEPHEN HALLIDAY<br><br>Published on the 02 February<br>2014<br>18:01<br>Print this<br><br>CELTIC manager Neil Lennon today accused drunken Aberdeen fans of throwing missiles towards him at a League Cup tie on Saturday, but said it had not been a sectarian attack.<br><br>Lennon left the Scottish League Cup semi-final between Aberdeen and St Johnstone at Tynecastle in Edinburgh 20 minutes before the end of the match after coins and a drink container hit people near him.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very uncomfortable and very unsavoury.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to take anything away from what was a great day for Aberdeen. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s fair.<br><br>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t apportion any blame to them, it was just a section of their supporters who probably had far too much to drink and wanted to single me out.<br><br>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it was sectarian. It was drink-fuelled and yes it is unacceptable.&rdquo;<br><br>Lennon was sitting with Celtic coach Garry Parker, physio Tim Williamson and Hearts assistant manager Billy Brown, and close to Aberdeen staff in the directors box at the Hearts stadium when the trouble started.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;You get the usual abuse, which is fine. You can get over that.<br><br>&ldquo;But then I was aware of a coin flying past my head and it actually hit an Aberdeen member of staff on the back.<br><br>&ldquo;He was wearing a padded jacket and he was aware something hit him. He handed the coin to the steward.&rdquo;<br><br>Lennon said stewards moved him to just in front of the Press box at half time.<br><br>He said: &ldquo;When Aberdeen scored the third goal, a drink of some sorts came flying over my head.<br><br>&ldquo;It missed me and landed in the Press box, hitting a couple of journalists.<br><br>&ldquo;I thought, &lsquo;We need to think of the safety of other people around us&rsquo;.<br><br>&ldquo;This guy had been hit with a coin.<br><br>&ldquo;We said we&rsquo;d see how the next 15 minutes goes. When it happened again, we decided not to stick about.<br><br>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just unsavoury, unnecessary and uncalled for.&rdquo;<br><br>Witnesses said Lennon had withstood nearly an hour of verbal abuse before leaving the stadium. Aberdeen won 4-0.<br><br>The Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) said the incidents had been &ldquo;utterly unacceptable&rdquo;.<br><br>Chief executive Neil Doncaster said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to congratulate Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle on reaching the Scottish League Cup Final after two thrilling semi-finals this weekend.<br><br>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we understand the Celtic manager Neil Lennon was the subject of abusive treatment by a minority of fans during yesterday&rsquo;s game.<br><br>&ldquo;Given this occurred at one of our games, we&rsquo;d like to apologise to Neil Lennon for this utterly unacceptable behaviour.<br><br>&ldquo;The SPFL is united in its total condemnation of this type of incident, which has no place in a football stadium nor society overall.&rdquo;<br><br>Police Scotland said they had received no complaints about the incidents.<br><br>A spokeswoman said: &ldquo;Police in Edinburgh have received no reports relating to assaults or abuse of anyone associated with Celtic or Heart of Midlothian football clubs following the match on Saturday.&rdquo;<br><br>The incident is the latest of a series of attacks on Lennon over the last 11 years.<br><br>Two students were fined after he was attacked in his car in Glasgow in 2003.<br><br>A year later, threatening graffiti was daubed outside his home and he was the victim of road rage when he was repeatedly yelled at on the M8 motorway.<br><br>In 2008, Lennon was treated in hospital after being attacked hours after an Old Firm game. Two Rangers fans were later jailed for two years each.<br><br>A package of bullets addressed to Lennon was intercepted at a sorting office in Country Antrim, in 2011.<br><br>Two men were jailed for five years in 2012 for sending Lennon parcel bombs.  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>  BBC</h3>Kris Commons&#39; goal against St Mirren gave Celtic their 14th consecutive win, extending their Premiership lead to 21 points.<br><br>Commons netted his 22nd goal of the campaign, beating goalkeeper Marian Kello from distance in the first half.<br><br>The Hoops dominated and could have made the score-line far more convincing as they passed up several opportunities.<br><br>Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster was rarely troubled and made a club-record 11th consecutive shut-out.<br><br>The Saints stay in ninth position and are increasingly becoming embroiled in a relegation play-off battle.<br><br>Having met earlier in January and the Hoops running out emphatic 4-0 victors, it was more of the same at Celtic Park as Commons once again proved irrepressible.<br>Play media<br><br>The attacker&#39;s influence was felt as early as the sixth minute as he received a pass from Emilio Izaguirre, glided away from Jim Goodwin before powering an effort from distance that Kello was unable to keep out.<br><br>That set the tone for a one-sided encounter and, while Neil Lennon had said before the match that it was a &quot;free game&quot; for the visitors, it was the hosts who were playing free-flowing, slick and entertaining football; the type you would expect from a side with an 18-point lead at the top pre-match.<br><br>It was the 18th-minute that home supporters demonstrated their solidarity for Lennon, who was targeted by fans at the League Cup semi-final yesterday.<br><br>However, before that, the impressive Virgil van Dijk showed his strength and balance, holding off a couple of Saints players before releasing Anthony Stokes, whose dinked effort went narrowly wide.<br><br>The Irishman was clearly determined to make his 100th appearance for the club memorable and fashioned an opportunity for himself, pirouetting before sending an effort clear of the target as Celtic looked to turn their domination into a sizeable lead.<br><br>Lennon&#39;s men were unrelenting and Scott Brown could have doubled the hosts&#39; advantage, but fired over the bar after tidy work by Commons.<br>Play media<br><br>A brief reprieve for the Saints saw former Rangers man Gregg Wylde latch onto a long ball and test Forster, but the shot-stopper was untroubled, before more Celtic pressure resumed.<br><br>Stefan Johansen, making his first start for the club, created an opening but could not execute the shot properly, before James Forrest cut inside and fizzed a low shot that Kello had to get low down to save.<br><br>The one-way traffic continued after the break as Buddies defender Marc McAusland almost put into his own net following Charlie Mulgrew&#39;s centre.<br><br>St Mirren&#39;s forays into champions&#39; territory were few and far between.<br><br>Steven Thompson did attempt to be a nuisance, forcing Efe Ambrose to clear hastily; while debutant Josh Magennis warmed the palms of Forster with a stinging shot.<br><br>However, the Saints had to be aware of the threat at the other end, with Forrest unable to convert the couple of chances that came his way.<br><br>Adam Campbell was flung on in place of Goodwin as St Mirren searched for an equaliser, but it was the hosts who looked more likely to add to their lead, with substitute Amido Balde coming close, before Stokes rounded Kello and missed.<br><br><br><br><h3>Celtic&#39;s Neil Lennon suffers spitting and coin-throwing</h3><br>Aberdeen and Celtic have condemned fans whose behaviour forced the Glasgow club&#39;s manager, Neil Lennon, to leave Saturday&#39;s League Cup semi-final early.<br><br>The 42-year-old was spat at, had coins thrown at him and was the subject of verbal abuse in the Tynecastle stand, according to his agent, Martin Reilly.<br><br>He had been a spectator as Aberdeen defeated St Johnstone 4-0.<br><br>Both Celtic and Aberdeen, whose fans were in the main stand, described the behaviour as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.<br><br> &ldquo;We would urge anyone who has any information as to the identity of those responsible to get in touch with the club&rdquo;<br><br>Aberdeen Football Club<br><br>The Dons, who reached their first cup final since 2000, pleaded for supporters to report those responsible.<br><br>&quot;The support we enjoyed at Tynecastle was absolutely fantastic and helped to create an incredible atmosphere that the manager and players acknowledged played a major part in what was wonderful day and occasion for Aberdeen Football Club,&quot; said a statement on their club website.<br><br>&quot;However, it would appear that a tiny minority within the main stand behaved in a manner that is completely unacceptable and has absolutely no place in football.<br><br>&quot;And we would urge anyone who has any information as to the identity of those responsible to get in touch with the club in order that appropriate action can be taken.&quot;<br><br>Reilly told BBC Scotland that Lennon and Celtic coach Gary Parker had to leave their seats in the main stand after 70 minutes of the game.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m absolutely raging about the treatment of Neil, about the stewarding and the fans&#39; behaviour,&quot; he said.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s scandalous that Neil is treated like this.&quot;<br><br> &ldquo;We have an excellent relationship with Aberdeen Football Club and we are sure they will look into this matter&rdquo;<br><br>Celtic spokesman<br><br>Play was also held up briefly as two young supporters ran on to the park and got to the technical area before being apprehended by police and stewards.<br><br>Lennon was sitting in the main stand, which housed Aberdeen fans on Saturday, yards above the technical area where he was infamously attacked by a Hearts fan in 2011, at Tynecastle.<br><br>The Celtic manager walked out of the stadium in Edinburgh shortly after Adam Rooney scored the third goal in the 62nd minute.<br><br>A Celtic spokesman said: &quot;Clearly it is totally unacceptable for the Celtic manager to be treated in this way.<br><br>&quot;Neil has complimented the way in which the situation was handled by stewarding staff at Tynecastle.<br><br>&quot;We have an excellent relationship with Aberdeen Football Club and we are sure they will look into this matter.&quot;<br>Also related to this story<br><br><br>Live Text Commentary<br>Full time<br><br>Full Time Match ends, Celtic 1, St Mirren 0.<br>90:00 +2:25 Full time<br><br>Full Time Second Half ends, Celtic 1, St Mirren 0.<br>90:00 +2:12<br><br>Foul by Efe Ambrose (Celtic).<br>90:00 +2:12<br><br>Adam Campbell (St Mirren) wins a free kick in the defensive half.<br>88:49<br><br>Attempt missed.
