Ntcham booked while Power has a player stretchered off. Two terrible refereeing performances in the past two games.

His one role tonight was to take players out.</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">Neil Lennon: &ldquo;Leigh was taking some serious abuse and didn&rsquo;t react in a malicious way at all. He&rsquo;s not the perpetrator &ndash; the abuse was totally uncalled for.&rdquo;</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">JM on Twitter: Kris Boyd hammerin is joke. 34 appearances in 135 league games because he stepped away from the game due to mental health issues. NOT because he wasn&rsquo;t pulling his weight in training. How are players meant to be more open about issues ?</span><br><br><span class="diffAdd">CLMAO on Twitter: Well Leigh Griffiths has played 71 (not 34) out of 135 league games, and he had 7 months out with mental health issues. He&rsquo;s scored 42 goals in that time.   Not only is he a ***** pundit, he also can&rsquo;t count.</span><br><br>(El Salto of KDS)<br>A great result against a bunch of fecking cluggers<br> The tackle on Frimpong that led to the lad being stretchered off was vindictive and calculated<br> Dicker, Power and Bruce were at it all night, persistent fouling, yet somehow Ntcham was the first name in the book<br> We should have scored six, but settle for three.<br> The crowd of just over 8,000 is a classic case of a home club cutting  their nose off to spite their face, it would have been 3,000 more if  they hadn&#39;t decided to make the other stand unavailable to Celtic<br> You just wonder how long they&#39;ll continue with with the current set up,  although I&#39;d suspect that it won&#39;t be too long, money is king.<br><br>(MLE of KDS)<br>When we play with confidence and a coherent plan we win. Both strikers  had excellent games (Griff had a better game than he&#39;s played for a long  time and Eddy doesn&#39;t have an equal on the ball), our midfield 3 were  compact and, mostly, well disciplined in the press and our defence were  solid for 99% of that. Ntcham needs to be on the pitch every game right  now for me.<br> <br> They are hammer throwing cretins taking advantage of a referee who  couldn&#39;t keep up with play and was reluctant to do anything about fouls  when he did happen to be in a good position. Their pitch would make for a  better game of Subbuteo than football.<br> <br> We need to maintain this level of performance which probably means a bit  of rotation because the likes of Brown and McGregor will not be able to  keep this up over the fixture list we&#39;ve got this month within that  shape.

They were worthy winners, albeit they had to respond to Nicke Kabamba pulling a goal back for Kilmarnock midway through the second half.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s reaction was emphatic, Christopher Jullien&rsquo;s goal ensuring they claimed all three points and condemned Killie to a sixth straight league defeat.<br><br>If Celtic could have hand-picked a fixture to resume their title defence after the winter break, this one would not have been at the top of their list.<br><br>Having lost two of their previous three league visits to Rugby Park, there was clearly the potential for a difficult night for the eight-in-a-row champions.<br><br>But Lennon could have no complaints about the eagerness and energy his players brought to the task from the opening moments as they looked to provide the necessary response to that Old Firm defeat at the end of December.<br><br>Celtic should have been in front as early as the fourth minute when Griffiths, starting a second consecutive match for the first time in 15 months, raced clear into the penalty area.<br><br>The striker did the hard bit by eluding a challenge from Kilmarnock defender Stuart Findlay but then slipped at the crucial moment as a simple shooting chance escaped him.<br><br>Celtic&rsquo;s bright start continued when Jan Koprivec was forced into a magnificent save, Killie&rsquo;s Slovenian &lsquo;keeper throwing himself to his right to keep out Jozo Simunovic&rsquo;s header from a Griffiths corner.<br><br>The hosts were riding their luck and were certainly fortunate in the 10th minute when Koprivec was not penalised for a clumsy challenge on Griffiths inside the box. The ball broke to Edouard who, with the goal gaping, slid his shot wide.<br><br>It was a howler from the normally deadly French striker but he would go on to make amends. But not before Kilmarnock posed their first threat of the evening when Chris Burke&rsquo;s corner caused confusion in the Celtic defence and Kabamba came agonisingly close to bundling the ball home from close range.<br><br>Celtic were soon back on the front foot and passed up another glaring chance when Callum McGregor shot wide of Koprivec&rsquo;s left hand post after superb hold-up play from Edouard created the opening.<br>Celtic are closing in on their second signing of the window. Picture: SNS<br>Celtic near completion of second January signing Ismaila Soro<br><br> <br> <br><br> <br> <br><br>The breakthrough looked inevitable and it duly arrived in the 25th minute. Jeremie Frimpong was the architect, the young wing-back bursting beyond Killie left-back Niko Hamalainen down Celtic&rsquo;s right flank.<br><br>His low cross was deflected into the feet of Edouard who displayed great strength and poise to shrug off Alan Power&rsquo;s challenge and drive a close range shot beyond Koprivec.<br><br>Celtic appeared fairly comfortable with their lead for the rest of the first half, without seriously threatening to add to it. There was one moment of concern for the visitors five minutes before the break when Hamalainen made a fine surge down the left before delivering a dangerous cross which neither Mohamed El Makrini or Burke could connect with in the six yard box with Fraser Forster flat-footed.<br><br>The Celtic &lsquo;keeper was yet to be seriously tested but he was relieved to see Kabamba&rsquo;s shot deflected just wide of his right hand post two minutes into the second half as Killie looked to respond.<br><br>But their hopes of a recovery were dented when Celtic doubled their lead in the 51st minute. Frimpong again caused problems for the home defence with a burst down the right, feeding the ball to McGregor who shuttled it on to Griffiths on the left of the penalty area.<br><br>Killie&rsquo;s appeals for an offside decision fell on deaf ears as Griffiths close range shot beat Koprivec rather cheaply from the &lsquo;keeper&rsquo;s perspective at his near post.<br><br>Edouard twice came close to further extending Celtic&rsquo;s advantage, seeing one shot bravely blocked by Alex Bruce and another saved by Koprivec, as Lennon&rsquo;s men looked to be in cruise control.<br><br>But they were jolted in the 66th minute when Kilmarnock pulled a goal back, substitute Eamonn Brophy setting up a chance for Alan Power whose shot was smartly headed beyond Forster by Kabamba.<br><br>An anxious finale now beckoned for Celtic but they eased the concerns of the travelling support when their two-goal lead was restored seven minutes later. Griffiths added to his satisfying night&rsquo;s work with an assist, his corner from the left thundered beyond Koprivec by Jullien&rsquo;s towering header.<br><br>The only sour notes for Celtic came in stoppage time with injuries to Frimpong, who was taken off on a stretcher after lengthy treatment, and top scorer Edouard who limped away in some discomfort.<br><br>Celtic boss vows to back Leigh Griffiths if SFA take action over Rugby Park incident<br>Stephen Halliday<br>Email<br>Published: 22:53<br>Updated: 23:01 Wednesday 22 January 2020<br><br>Celtic manager Neil Lennon has vowed to vigorously defend Leigh Griffiths against any potential disciplinary charge after the striker was involved in heated scenes at Rugby Park.<br><br>Griffiths scored his second goal in as many appearances as the Scottish champions beat Kilmarnock 3-1 win to maintain their two point lead over Rangers at the top of the Premiership.<br>Neil Lennon with Leigh Griffiths after the striker was substituted. Picture: SNS<br>Neil Lennon with Leigh Griffiths after the striker was substituted. Picture: SNS<br><br>When the 29-year-old was substituted 10 minutes from time, he responded to what Lennon described as &lsquo;unsavoury abuse&rsquo; from among the home support by throwing his sock tape in their direction.<br><br>But Lennon insists Griffiths has no case to answer amid speculation he could face a notice of complaint from the Scottish FA compliance officer.<br><br>&ldquo;If there is going to be something made of this, then I will be at the front of the queue backing him up,&rdquo; said Lennon.<br><br>&ldquo;He was getting a lot of unsavoury abuse which was totally uncalled for. He was backed up by myself and his team-mates on the bench.<br><br>&ldquo;I thought his behaviour tonight was exemplary. He didn&rsquo;t do anything wrong. People can blow it up but it was nothing.<br><br>&ldquo;He always seems to get controversy surrounding him but I&rsquo;ll back him to the hilt on this one. His behaviour tonight was top class, as was his performance.<br><br>The kid had played well, he hadn&rsquo;t got himself into any bother on the pitch. He goes and sits down and gets abuse from supporters. In this day and age, we have to accept that and behave in a sanitised way. He did.<br><br>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking for a story that&rsquo;s just not there. If there is a story, I&rsquo;ll back him and defend him to the hilt.<br><br>&quot;He didn&#39;t (throw it at a supporter). He threw a bit of tape on the ground. I don&#39;t know how you can say he threw it at somebody or towards somebody. People take off tape and throw it away, so to me there is nothing in it.&rdquo;<br><br>Lennon, who is hopeful right-back Jeremie Frimpong has not sustained a serious injury despite being taken off on a stretcher in stoppage time, was thrilled by his team&rsquo;s dominant display in their first league game after the winter break.<br><br>&ldquo;It was an outstanding performance,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult place to come, sometimes the surface can be difficult, but we made easy weather of it tonight.<br>Hibs winger Martin Boyle, right, in action against Hamilton Accies.

The players&rsquo; attitude was top class. I&rsquo;m absolutely delighted in the context of the season, that&rsquo;s as good as we&rsquo;ve played in a while.&rdquo;  <br><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-border-rows" width="100%">  <tbody>  <tr>  <td class="WPC-edit-borderTop-none" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table></div>                  BBC<br><br><br>By Thomas Duncan<br><br>BBC Scotland<br><br> From the section Scottish Premiership <br><br>Highlights - Kilmarnock 1-3 Celtic<br><br>Odsonne Edouard and Leigh Griffiths both scored as Celtic maintained a two-point lead at the top of the Scottish Premiership with victory at Kilmarnock.<br><br>Edouard superbly slotted home his 14th league goal of the season before the break as strike partner Griffiths added his second in two games.<br><br>Despite Celtic&#39;s dominance, Kilmarnock threatened to come back after Nicke Kabamba&#39;s clever header.<br><br>But Christopher Jullien restored the two-goal lead just seven minutes later.<br><br>Celtic still lead rivals Rangers by two points, having played a game more than the Ibrox side as the Premiership resumed following a three-week winter break.<br><br>The only negative for Celtic was the loss of Jeremie Frimpong to injury in stoppage time as the right-back was carried off on a stretcher.<br><br> Griffiths &#39;the victim&#39; in fan incident<br> Reaction &amp; as it happened<br><br>Edouard-Griffiths partnership menaces for Celtic<br><br>Neil Lennon&#39;s decision to emerge from the winter hibernation with a new system was perhaps induced by the slight downturn in control and intensity in Celtic&#39;s performances - if not results - throughout December, which ended with a painful defeat by rivals Rangers.<br><br>A 3-5-2 was a formation he used with great success at Hibernian, and when your options up front include the league&#39;s current top goalscorer and the top flight&#39;s most prolific forward of the last decade, then it&#39;s perhaps no surprise the Celtic manager sought to get both on the pitch at the same time.<br><br>Despite the assumption that modern strikers prefer to fly solo, Edouard and Griffiths both put in superb performances at Rugby Park that hinted this could be a long-term option and not just a means to compensate for the loss of the prolific Ryan Christie from midfield through suspension.<br><br>For the opening goal, Edouard had no right to control Frimpong&#39;s cross on the turn given the deflection that would have deceived most, but he stopped it dead. Then, in another cruel flash of his feet, he left Alan Power flat on his back before calmly finishing across goal.<br><br>It capped a good opening 24 minutes for Celtic in which Edouard shone - a rare poor finish aside - as he generally caused a nuisance whenever he touched the ball.<br><br>There were other opportunities, too, Callum McGregor firing just wide after Edouard had mesmerised four blue shirts to create space for him.<br><br>Not to be outdone, Griffiths doubled the lead after the break with a low finish after more good work from Frimpong allowed McGregor to poke the ball towards him in the box.<br><br>And the new strike partnership continued to shine, as first Griffiths deftly poked a ball through for Edouard, who was denied by Jan Koprivec, and then the Scotland striker&#39;s dummy for his partner allowed him to race clear to force another fine stop from the Kilmarnock goalkeeper.<br><br>But despite the pair&#39;s menace, Celtic&#39;s pile of missed chances - for seven minutes at least - threatened to topple them when Kabamba cleverly diverted Power&#39;s shot past Fraser Forster to narrow the lead to a single goal.<br><br>That was Kilmarnock&#39;s first league goal in six matches, and despite riding their luck they carried a threat in the second half that will give manager Alex Dyer hope, even if Jullien&#39;s towering header from Griffiths&#39; pinpoint corner consigned them to a sixth straight league loss.<br><br>The injury to Frimpong, involved in the first two goals, clouded an otherwise bright evening in Ayrshire for Celtic, as any long-term absence would leave Moritz Bauer as the only fit first-team right-back given the continued absence of Hatem Abd Elhamed.<br><br>Griffiths too may have sullied an otherwise superb evening as he got involved with a Kilmarnock supporter when he was replaced by Mikey Johnston with 10 minutes left.<br>Killie stat<br>Man of the match - Callum McGregor<br><br>BBC Scotland&#39;s John Barnes at Rugby Park<br><br>McGregor was at the heart of many of Celtic&#39;s offensive moves, particularly in the first half.

I don&rsquo;t know how you can say he threw it at somebody or towards somebody. People take off tape and throw it away so to me there is nothing in it.<br><br>&ldquo;I asked him if anything went on and he said no and he was backed up by his team-mates. If there is going to be something made of this then I will be at the front of the queue backing him up.<br><br>&ldquo;He was getting a lot of unsavoury abuse which was totally uncalled for.<br><br>&ldquo;Leigh was taking some serious abuse and he didn&rsquo;t react in a malicious way at all.
