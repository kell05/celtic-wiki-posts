The club was fast heading down the drain, having suffered some horrendous seasons of late, and a gap was opening up fast both on &amp; off the field with Rangers as they spent their way to the top. <br><br>The group began in 1991 founded by Willie Wilson (from Clydebank). A brave man who decided to begin a stand against the board with this group, and he simply dived into the pool at the deep end. The fanzines were already in full flow but this was the first attempt for some direct action by the support. <br><br>The inaugural meeting was held at Shettleston Town Hall, and Willie Wilson took the stage to get the attending fans going. It was invitation-only for this meeting, and there was said to be a healthy attendance of around 300. Some might makes jibes about the invitation-only aspect but it was the first of its kind, and an organised orderly start was likely better than a potential free-for-all. It was a fair success and got things off the ground.<br><br>Larger rallies were organised with deposed board member <a href="/page/Brian+Dempsey" target="_self">Brian Dempsey</a> brought in to speak to the support. In his speech he urged us all to &quot;Go that extra mile to achieve what we want and deserve as the paying customer&quot;. Nice words!<br><br>In addition, the lauded lawyer Joe Beltrami opened up proceedings reading out a disparaging letter from board member <a href="/page/Chris+White" target="_self">Chris White</a>. The letter stated that the rally would &quot;serve little purpose and simply cause embarrassment to the Club&quot;. If you were to ever describe Chris White&#39;s efforts at the club, then you could use the same line!<br><br>Lisbon Lion <a href="/page/Craig%2C+Jim" target="_self">Jim Craig</a> also stood up in front of the support at these rallies . It is said that he lost his role with Radio Scotland (as an analyst) due to his appearance at the rally. In fairness, neutrality in these issues is meant to be a prerequisite for the roles on Radio Scotland Sportsound, but seems to never have been an issue for others.<br><br>Board member <a href="/page/James+Farrell" target="_self">James Farrell</a> attended a rally as well (he was joined by Tom Devlin whose family had also been long-term shareholders and board members). James Farrell was a persona non grata on the board, and his contribution was welcome but not necessarily easy. Mr  Farrell was asked a question from the floor, requesting feedback on  what had happened to the gate receipts the club had taken in over the  years. The reply was &quot;...it has all been ploughed in to the stadium...&quot;  (we are talking about the old Celtic Park here of course!). In NTV&#39;s immortal phrase, &quot;<i>Jimmy walked off stage to the sound of his own footsteps</i>&quot;.<br><br>Sadly despite the initial interest, the group declined very rapidly. There just wasn&#39;t the supporter morale or even sufficient enthusiasm for a concerted effort by the wider support (and possibly not the manpower backing). <br><br>Ironically, the group got going in a bad spell but then Celtic hit a purple patch with two consecutive wins over Rangers which were live on TV (St Patrick day massacre and league game following Sunday). This in itself seemed to raise spirits amongst the support. What was needed for the group was a continuation of the prior set of poor results and falling attendances but it  never wholly fell that way for a short time. Myopia amongst the general support made it all appear as if the group was no longer necessary. <br><br>It was disappointing and with hindsight the support were to regret not taking action sooner with this group. It was to be another three years before the board were brought down.<br><br>The later rallies were likely scaled up too fast, and possibly was another reason for the demise of the group. Numbers weren&#39;t as high as could have been (mainly as some of the venues were too large) but this was the days before the  internet, and the fanzines were only monthly publications (then the main  Celtic based forum for discussion/analysis within the support). Possibly more widespread publicity and discussion on the group&#39;s efforts would have made the rallies more successful.<br><br>The board easily dismissed the efforts by &quot;Save Our Celts&quot;. <a href="/page/Terry+Cassidy" target="_self">Terry Cassidy</a> (Celtic Chief Executive) made patronising remarks and dismissed the group &amp; their rallies in the club newspaper. It didn&#39;t reflect well on him and was another step in creating a division between the club and the supporters. Terry Cassidy&#39;s mentality was to be a bone of contention for everyone in time (both within and outwith of Celtic).<br><br>Disappointingly, George Delaney (General Secretary of the Celtic Supporters Association) would not attend and was as dismissive of the group as our own board, and is said to have described the group as a bandwagon for certain people to use. Sad to see but it does illustrate the divided nature of the support during the early days of &quot;Sack The Board&quot;. There is a big myth that the whole support was wholly united against the board. The truth is far different. There were factions and extremes of views, and it was a prime cause for the longevity of the board in the circumstances. It wasn&#39;t until much later on that the support could be said to have been united as such against the old board, and it took a lot of work to do so.<br><br>One group of people who definitely learnt lessons from this group were those behind <a href="/page/Celts+for+Change" target="_self">&#39;Celts for Change</a><a href="/page/Celts+for+Change" target="_self">&#39;</a>. They were a later successor to the original &#39;Save Our Celts&#39; and unlike their predecessors, there was no way &#39;Celts For Change&#39; could fail without the club also failing with them. Willie Wilson was invited to be part of running the new group but opted not to. It was he who introduced Brendan Sweeney to Matt McGlone to get the new group going. The committee men behind <a href="/page/Celts+for+Change" target="_self">&#39;Celts for Change</a><a href="/page/Celts+for+Change" target="_self">&#39;</a> were able to take the experiences of &#39;Save Our Celts&#39; as a basis for their efforts, and thankfully they were to succeed.<br><br>&#39;Save Our Celts&#39; is too often forgotten in retrospectives on the whole Celtic Takeover. Certainly all the supporters empathise with what they set out to do, and for that we should pay them the due respect that they have always deserved.<div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Save Our Celts by Willie Wilson (founder of the group)</h3><h3>April 2011</h3>In   late 1990, following the removal, (on the eve of an important cup   final), of Director Brian Dempsey from the Celtic Board by the   White/Kelly dynasties at Celtic. It became clear that  those in power at  Celtic Park were more interested in themselves and  protecting the  family jewels than the actual success of Celtic and it  supporters.<br><br>I,   and a few mates, had been become increasingly frustrated at the   direction Celtic were taking in the late 80&rsquo;s and given the &lsquo;revolution&rsquo;   at Ibrox, we realised that to compete we would have to invest not only   heavily in a new squad but a new stadium and attract new board member.   However, the likelihood of ever achieving that was nil due to the   structure in place. Undeterred, we decided  in Jan 1991 to hand leaflets  out at the Hearts game to try and attract  an interest in a pressure  group aimed at giving the fragmented voice of  the support an airing.</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>So,  on that Saturday, myself  and two mates (Andy McGarvey and Stevie  Hepburn) handed out about a  1,000 leaflets prior to the match &ndash;most of  the fan reaction was hostile,  but we had support from &#39;Not The View&#39; in that day&rsquo;s  fanzine to help attract  awareness. Ten days later the inaugural meeting  of &#39;Save Our Celts&#39; was  held in the Sundowners pub on Queen St &ndash;attended  by about 20 fans.<br><br>From  this, a core group of Jim Orr, David  Ashman, Brian Mullan, Duncan Hart  and myself started to issue a  newsletter to about 400 or so who had  registered an interest in the  movement. We targeted the media at large  to promote our name and aims  and in this respect Hugh Keevins was  exceptional at the Scotsman and on  Clyde . We got &#39;Not The View&#39; and &#39;Once A Tim&#39;  onside too and we stared to spread  the message of why we were so  frustrated and alienated and we set out  what we were seeking - the  removal of the board and a share issue for  ordinary fans.</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>We   had no internet or mobiles, so we had to type up and print off these 6   page newsletters every couple of month or so. It was quite a job and  it  cost us all a few bob in stationary and postage- but it was worth  the  effort and expense. (Brian Dempsey actually gave us money when he  came  to our rally to help us).<br><br>It  became clear that we would  hold a rally in Glasgow and we would invite a  number of guests to the  podium who agreed with our agenda. We also  agreed to invite the Board  so as to give the their opportunity to speak  and respond. Who knows-  maybe we had got it all wrong?</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>We   approached GCC for the hire of a hall and when asked on the numbers we   could only guess- anything from 50-500. They said that they needed  exact  number for health and safety so we went for Shettleston which  held 400  or so and decided just to issue tickets to those on our  mailing list on  the hope they would turn up. They all did!<br><br>The  first rally took place on Feb 24th 1991. The panel included Gerry  Dunbar, Jim Craig, Brian Dempsey and myself with Tom Grant and Jimmy  Farrell representing the board. It  was chaired by Joe Beltrami. Each  panel member said their piece on  where they believed Celtic were going  wrong and the direction needed to  go in an effort to change things  quickly. Jim Craig read out letters of  support from 5 of the Lions and I  spoke of the desire to set up an  &#39;Independent Celtic Supporters Club&#39;  (ICSC) to rival the voice of the  Association and George Delaney. Tom  and Jimmy, while affable and  pleasant were just so out of touch with  the rest of the room that it was  embarrassing. They genuinely believed  what they were saying and that  millions had been spent on making Celtic  Park a &lsquo;great stadium&rsquo;.</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>The   event raised our profile and publicity followed, but yet we never   seemed to have more than 500 or so on our mailing list and the idea of   an ICSC never really got off the ground. Nevertheless, we issued 8   newsletters to the masses on a bi monthly period to keep them updated.<br><br>In   between times we had numerous spats with the Board and Terry Cassidy  in  particular. Celtic&rsquo;s form improved a bit, we beat the Huns twice in a   week and McNeill seemed to have steadied the ship, but defeat by   Motherwell in the cup signed his sack papers. Still, our numbers never  increased.</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>By   summer Liam Brady was appointed and given a decent amount of money to   improve the club. His reign started well and we became a bit of an   irrelevance for the best part. However, we pressed ahead and arranged a   second rally at Shettleston - this time with Cassidy agreeing to  appear.<br><br>What  really should have been a show of defiance by our  members in Dec, ended  up a bit of a damp squib as Cassidy played the  pantomime villain to  perfection and won a fair amount of the audience  on his side with his  smart answers whilst never really telling them  anything of note -  promising big new stadium, new players, smashing the  Huns etc.. etc...</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>Things   looked up for us in early 1992, as we had back to back defeats to the   Huns and hearts, ending our title aspirations. Soon after Brady   resigned. This should have been the catalyst for us and the fanzines to   ram home our opposition to the Board and get the fans on side, but the   team under Frank Connor then Macari went on a run of about 15 games   undefeated in the league (inc the Huns) - it looked again as if we as a   club had turned the corner and for many of the support that&rsquo;s all that   mattered &ndash; wining on the pitch. Still no trophies appeared.<br><br>We   decided at the end of that season to wind up the campaign- it had been   going for 18 months and, despite raising awareness to the wider ranging   issues of control and ineptitude of the families running Celtic- we had   achieved very little in the way of fan power. As I mentioned before, I   think we just arrived a bit too soon for the support to embrace such   radical change. We were too small an organisation to have real clout and  certainly we never got in a position to organise a boycott. The   reality though, was that we were not radical enough and subsequent   events by &#39;Celts for Change&#39; highlighted that fact. Indeed, Matt&rsquo;s book   summarises the times very well I think.</div><div align="left" class="yiv1163133895ecxyiv1813655485MsoNormal"><br>Thankfully,   by the end of that year Brendan Sweeney got in contact with me to talk   about starting it up again, I&rsquo;ll be honest my head said the fans wont  be  up for it whilst my heart said go for it, in any case I advised him  to  talk to Matt McGlone and take it from there &ndash; the rest as they say  is  History. </div><div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Links</h3><ul><li><a href="/page/Celtic+Takeover" target="_self">Celtic Takeover</a><br></li><li><a href="/page/Celts+for+Change" target="_self">Celts for Change</a></li></ul><h3>KDS</h3><ul><li><a class="external" href="http://kerrydalestreet.co.uk/topic/8487977/1/?x=50#new" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Save Our Celts (2011)</a></li></ul><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3></h3><h3>How It All Began; A letter by Willie Wilson of the Save Our Celts campaign<br></h3><br>Save Our Celts<br><br>Article from Once A Tim No. 2 &mdash; 1991<br><br>As you read this, you will no doubt be aware that Celtic Football Club faces its most difficult challenge in all of its 103 years. The challenge? To drag the club kicking and screaming into reality! A challenge that requires the building of a new all-seated stadia, the re-building of a once proud team and more importantly the working on a blueprint to ensure a successful future for our club.<br><br>At this moment in time, Celtic FC is nowhere near to achieving these aims. The whole club appears to be in total disarray. The reason for this sorry state of affairs is that for longer than most of us care to remember, the Club has been grossly mismanaged at the highest level &mdash; the boardroom.<br><br>Things aren&#39;t much better on the park, the difference being that things can be improved in a playing sense by bringing in new players or management. Unfortunately, because of its very set up this can not be done off the park where change is needed most. You see, whether we like it or not, the Directors at Celtic Park are here to stay &mdash; or are they?<br><br>Although the Directors can&#39;t be bought off, we are Save Our Celts believe that with public pressure, they can be forced off. For too long they have always relied on or played on the loyalty of the fans and never had any reason to fear a revolt or destine. Fortunately, this is no longer the case. In recent years, thanks mainly to the introduction of Fanzines, we Celtic fans have found a new way to express ourselves.<br><br>We started questioning the running of the Club, and quite frankly we were shocked with the answers we came up with. But what could we do to resolve the situation? No matter what we said or did, the Board ignored us and chose to treat us as a minority of &#39;malcontents&#39;, who in time would come around to their ways of thinking.<br><br>Over the past couple of years, this minority has turned into a majority and still they retreat us with disdain. It is for this reason that Save Our Celts, has been set up. After the years of frustration, a group of us decided that enough was enough and felt that as Celtic fans it was time we stood up against the Board. Surely it was better to try something rather than just sit back and watch the Club we love fall to pieces. Save Our Celts was born.<br><br>After the defeat by United at Tannadice, we got in touch with the press and radio and told them that a campaign had been set up by the supporters, so we got a bit of publicity from that. The next thing we did was get 10,000 or so leaflets printed and we handed them out at the Hearts and Hibs games at Parkhead.<br><br>The main aims of the Campaign is to try to force the directors at Celtic to change their direction on the running of the club. We would like to address such issues as the Club going public, the pathetic &pound;2 a week &#39;buy us a player&#39; scheme, the future of the stadium, the clubs condescending attitude to the fans and a move to have Brian Dempsey brought back onto the board in a more leading capacity.<br><br>We feel these aims can be achieved, but only if we get the support of the fans. The response to the leaflet drop has been encouraging, but we would like more support to make a bigger impact.<br><br>Our next step is to organise a rally, to determine the mood of the support, so if anyone is interested in attending we would like them to get in touch with us by writing to our PO Box No. As we&#39;ve said before, the campaigns success depends solely on the fans and the strength and commitment of the fans to force some kind of change at Celtic Park. We really have nothing to lose.<br><br>Willie Wilson<br>Let us know your views and if you enclose a stamped addressed envelope, we&#39;ll get back to you. Remember, the campaign is being set up by the fans, for the fans and its success depends solely on the fans. So please give us your support.  </div><table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop WPC-edit-borderBottom-solid2px WPC-edit-custom-borderBottom" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Newspaper articles on &quot;Save Our Celts&quot;</h3><div>Daily Record<br>March 4, 1994, Friday<br>BRIAN IS VOICE OF THE FANS<br><br>MILLIONAIRE Brian Dempsey has consistently championed the cause of the Celtic fans for change ...</div><div><br>After  experiencing at first hand the determination of the board to do things  their way.Dempsey, 44, was co-opted as a director of the club in May  1990, along with Michael Kelly.It was a real break with tradition which  was seen at the time as a far-sighted move to help the Parkhead club  increase revenue and boost their image in the business  community.Property developer Dempsey&#39;s company had enjoyed a turnover of  &pound;20 million in the financial year prior to his walking into the  boardroom.Dempsey was from outwith the family dynasties which had  controlled Celtic - he even had an executive box at Ibrox - but his  commitment to the club was never in doubt.<br><br>However, five months  later, he found himself booted out in bizarre circumstances.A mere five  minutes before the club&#39;s AGM in October 1990, Dempsey was told that  Michael Kelly and major shareholder Chris White intended to oppose his  ratification to the board.White said at the time there was a  &quot;fundamental difference of opinion at board level as to how the club  could be kept at the top level in British football&quot;.<br><br>Where Celtic  should play their football was central to that difference of  opinion.Dempsey felt Celtic should relocate in another part of  Glasgow.And he had a piece of prime land, at the edge of the Stepps  bypass, which he was keen to offer for a new stadium.It was also felt  his idea that Celtic should become a public limited company had not gone  down well with the men at the top.Fellow-director Jimmy Farrell became  embroiled in the row and claimed White had tried to axe him, too,  because he backed Dempsey.Fans were furious at the boardroom coup and  began a campaign for change.Dempsey, whose late father was the Labour MP  for Coatbridge and Airdrie, became their unofficial champion and spoke  at the inaugural meeting of the Save Our Celts group in February 1991.He  said the board should stop their &quot;childish petulance&quot; and forget the  idea that anyone who dares to criticise them is creating mischief.And  later he withdrew thousands of pounds in sponsorship to the club.<br><br>Since  then he has been a major player on the sidelines as the grass-roots  campaign to get rid of the board gained momentum.In March 1992, along  with financial expert David Low and Canadian Jim Doherty, he led a  successful fight by rebel shareholders to prevent Farrell and  fellow-director Tom Grant being booted off the board.Dempsey ridiculed  the board&#39;s plans to build a super stadium at Cambuslang, calling it  &quot;worse than EuroDisney,&quot; and encouraged fans to boycott matches.He told a  supporters rally: &quot;You have the power - use it. You have the courage -  don&#39;t be afraid.&quot; When Scots-born tycoon Fergus McCann came from Canada  to join the power struggle, Dempsey teamed up with him.<br><br>The  McCann-Dempsey consortium launched an &pound;18 million bid for control of  Celtic.But a voting pact of five directors stopped them in their  tracks.The pact prevented the &quot;rebels&quot; mustering enough votes to push  through their financial lifeline.The plug had been pulled. Dempsey and  McCann walked away.But they were never too far away from the action.<br>    <table align="bottom" cellpadding="3" class="WPC-edit-style-list5 WPC-edit-border-rows WPC-edit-styleData-color1=%23ebebeb&color2=%23c7c7c7" width="100%"> <tbody><tr><td class=" WPC-edit-borderTop-none WPC-edit-custom-borderTop" width="100%"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Born in a rage with rebellion in the blood</h3><b><br>     Scotland on Sunday<br><b>January</b>16, 1994, Sunday<br>BYLINE:</b>Celtic&#39;s Directors Box Has Always Been A Target For The Fans&#39; Resentment And Vituperation, reports Kevin McCarra<br><br>THE blood-letting has a bloodline.<br><br>You  can trace a genealogy for the protests which are now the most vivid  feature of any match at Parkhead.Resentment over the ownership of Celtic  has flared among the support in each generation and large doses of  success are usually required to tranquilise them once again.Celtic, in  their present form, were even born in the midst of rage.<br><br>There was  great dissent at the meeting in 1897 when the club turned itself into a  private limited company.Infuriated members complained, rightly, as it  turned out, that Celtic&#39;s original charitable purpose would be  weakened.Most insurrections, however, have been alfresco.</div><br>In  the dismal post-war years mutiny always seemed to be one bad result  away.The Supporters Association, then as now, toyed with the idea of a  boycott.The 1946 discussions were prompted by a 4-1 beating from Third  Lanark at Celtic Park.After the match 2,000 demonstrators gathered  out-side the stand until the police drove them off the premises and down  to London Road.<br><br>In 1963 the mounted police were performing exactly  the same manoeuvre to clear a crowd of comparable size.Those events are  recalled by David Potter, a classics teacher and writer of many wry  articles about the club who has been so angered by the present board  that he no longer attends Celtic games, preferring to commentate on  Raith Rovers matches for hospital radio.<br><br>&quot;I was 15 in 1963,&quot; he  remembers, &quot;and went to the Queen of the South game with my father.It  was early in the season and Celtic, as they always seemed to, had just  lost 3-0 to Rangers.They played very poorly to scrape a 1-1 draw with  Queen of the South and the people in the enclosure turned to shout  obscenities at the directors box.&quot;After the match many fans gathered  spontaneously outside the stand. I was as furious as anyone. We were all  protesting about the chairman of that time, Bob Kelly.&quot;The object of  the displeasure was happily oblivious to it all.He was not even on the  premises, having presciently chosen to travel to Dumfries for the  reserve fixture.This impressive gift for prudent absenteeism could be  genetic.Michael Kelly, nephew of the former chairman, was out of the  country when disorder broke out at the recent Old Firm match.<br><br>Decades  of furious incidents may make the current board believe that the  current episodes are no more than another passing squall.Pat Woods,  co-author of The Glory and the Dream, regarded as the finest history of  the club yet written, thinks that such confidence is misplaced.He is a  member of a Celtic Supporters Club and considers that the discontent is  more widespread than ever before: &quot;People I would have expected to be  sympathetic to the directors are utterly hostile. In fact, any backing  for the board has become a bit of a novelty.&quot;<br>Woods also points to  the changing nature of the support.&quot;I don&#39;t want to patronise the  previous generations but there have been far more opportunities for  working people to get a good education in modern times. You will now  find many fans who are in the professions and they see the situation  differently.<br><br>&quot;In the old days Kelly was the only director anyone knew  and people would perhaps just be shouting that they wanted a new inside  -forward.Now they want a revolution.The protest groups are far more  organised and expectations are higher.You could say that Jock Stein is  also responsible for the current situation.After his sustained success  supporters will always resent it when Rangers dominate.&quot;A chronology of  recent years tends to support Woods&#39; analysis.<br><br>Instead of sporadic  outbursts there has been a cumulative process.Not The View came into  being in the mid-1980s and has proved to be one of the most enduring of  British fanzines.Subsequently, it has been joined by Once A Tim which  has specialised in lengthy accounts of the struggle for control of  Celtic.<br>The pressure groups have also evolved.<br><br>&quot;Save Our Celts&quot;,  in operation at the start of the 1990s, ran out of steam but has been  succeeded by Celts for Change.The names tell the story.&quot;Save Our Celts&quot;  is a little plaintive.<br><br>&quot;Celts for Change&quot; sounds like people with an agenda.<br><br><div><img align="bottom" alt="Save Our Celts - The Celtic Wiki" height="672" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/3a3e950617b8dcf3634cf1015325e4fe/GW672H672" title="Save Our Celts - The Celtic Wiki" width="672"></div><div></div><img align="bottom" alt="Save Our Celts - The Celtic Wiki" height="937" src="http://image.wikifoundry.com/image/3/df06521e6162aafd9daecbe50ca6bdc7/GW712H937" title="Save Our Celts - The Celtic Wiki" width="712"><br></div></div>
